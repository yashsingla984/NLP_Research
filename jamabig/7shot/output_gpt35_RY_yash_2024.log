Reasoning: The chest radiograph shows 4 radio-opaque coin-shaped opacities in the stomach, which are likely foreign bodies. However, the patient denies any history of ingesting foreign bodies. Given the patient's clinical presentation of apneic episodes and low oxygen saturation, it is likely that the opacities in the stomach are causing obstruction and compromising the patient's respiratory function. In this case, the next step would be to arrange endoscopy to evaluate and potentially remove the foreign bodies.

Answer: B: Arrange endoscopy.

Reasoning:
- The patient presented with high-grade fever, neck pain, and a foreign body sensation in the throat after eating chicken, indicating a possible complication related to the esophageal foreign body removal.
- Laboratory investigations demonstrated an elevated leukocyte count, indicative of an active infection.
- Lateral soft tissue radiography showed a radio-opaque foreign body at the level of C6, confirming the presence of a foreign body in the upper cervical esophagus.
- Computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed a 2-cm radio-opaque osseous foreign body at the level of the cricopharyngeus muscle with signs of esophageal perforation and air leak tracking towards the left lobe of the thyroid gland.
- The repeated CT scan of the neck and chest revealed gas in the thyroid gland.
- Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is emphysematous thyroiditis, which is a rare complication of esophageal perforation that occurs when air accumulates within the thyroid gland.
- Parapharyngeal abscess and retropharyngeal abscess would typically present with localized swelling and signs of infection in the pharyngeal area, which are not present in this case.
- Mediastinitis would typically present with fever, chest pain, and respiratory compromise, which are not present in this case.

Answer: C: Emphysematous thyroiditis.

The clinical presentation of acute-onset painful scattered umbilicated papulopustules and ovoid ulcerated plaques with elevated, pink borders on the face, trunk, and extremities is highly suspicious for Herpes simplex virus (A). The Tzanck smear demonstrated ballooning of keratinocytes and peripheralization of nuclear material, which are consistent with herpesvirus infection. Therefore, the diagnosis in this case is Herpes simplex virus.

A) Perform a bone marrow biopsy.

**Reasoning**:
The patient's peripheral blood smear reveals the presence of 6% to 8% blast forms, which indicates the presence of immature myeloblasts. This finding, along with the significant leukocytosis, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, suggests the possibility of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). To confirm the diagnosis and determine the underlying cause, a bone marrow biopsy is the next appropriate step. It will provide further information about the percentage of blasts in the bone marrow, presence of dysplasia, and any genetic abnormalities that may help guide treatment decisions.

C: Perineural spread of cutaneous malignancy

**Reasoning**:
The patient presented with progressive right-sided facial numbness and weakness, vision changes, and headaches. The symptoms began 5 years earlier with right temple numbness, which expanded to include the entire right face and mouth. This suggests a progressive neuropathy involving the cranial nerves.

The patient has a history of left cheek melanoma and numerous cutaneous squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the bilateral head and neck. These malignancies may have spread along the nerves, resulting in the cranial neuropathy.

Other possible causes, such as primary leptomeningeal lymphoma (A), Tolosa-Hunt syndrome (B), and sphenoid wing meningioma (D), are less likely based on the clinical presentation and history. The CSF studies showing mildly elevated protein values are also consistent with perineural spread of malignancy.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is perineural spread of cutaneous malignancy (C).

D) Myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene fusions.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation, the patient is a 31-year-old man with neck and inguinal masses, intermittent itching, and night sweats for 2 years. The complete blood count and peripheral blood smear show marked leukocytosis with eosinophilia and elevated vitamin B12 levels. The bone marrow biopsy showed hypercellular marrow with myeloid hyperplasia, increased eosinophils, and a blast count of 2%. The positron emission tomographic-computed tomographic scan also revealed enlarged lymph nodes.

These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene fusions, also known as eosinophilic leukemia. This condition is characterized by the presence of fusion genes involving tyrosine kinases such as FIP1L1-PDGFRA, PDGFRA, or PDGFRB. This fusion leads to dysregulation of signaling pathways and increased production of eosinophils.

Kimura disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by enlarged lymph nodes, subcutaneous nodules, and eosinophilia. Classic Hodgkin lymphoma typically presents with painless lymphadenopathy, constitutional symptoms, and Reed-Sternberg cells on histopathology. T-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia usually presents with mediastinal masses, lymphadenopathy, and bone marrow involvement. None of these diagnoses match the clinical presentation and findings described in the case.

**Reasoning**: 

Based on the clinical presentation, the patient is a 28-year-old woman with painful cervical lymphadenopathy, fever, nausea, and vomiting. The symptoms have not improved with antibiotics and corticosteroids. She denies recent travel, sick contacts, or autoimmune disease. On examination, there is tender lymphadenopathy involving the right level V, and a CT scan reveals enlarged, matted nodes without evidence of an abscess. FNA biopsy shows nondiagnostic reactive lymph nodes.

The presence of coagulative necrosis, apoptosis, and karyorrhectic debris with absent neutrophils and hematoxylin bodies on pathological examination is suggestive of Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (also known as histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis). This is a rare, self-limiting disease characterized by necrotizing lymphadenopathy commonly affecting young adults, predominantly women. It typically presents with cervical lymphadenopathy, fever, and systemic symptoms. Diagnosis is confirmed by histopathological examination of lymph node biopsy, which shows characteristic findings of coagulative necrosis and histiocytes. 

Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is B: Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease.

B: Electrophysiology study.

**Reasoning**:
In this case, the patient has presented with symptoms of fever, hemoptysis, and syncopal episodes, along with an ECG showing monomorphic ventricular tachycardia with a morphology suggesting right ventricular (RV) origin. The patient also has severe RV and left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction. These findings raise concern for an underlying arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), which is a genetic condition characterized by ventricular arrhythmias and progressive RV dysfunction.

To further evaluate this patient, an electrophysiology study (EPS) is the most appropriate next step. An EPS can help confirm the diagnosis of ARVC and identify the exact location of the arrhythmia origin, which can guide management decisions. It can also provide information about the underlying electrical properties of the heart, such as the presence of accessory pathways or abnormal conduction pathways. EPS can help guide treatment decisions, including the need for an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement or ablation therapy.

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (Option A) can be useful in the evaluation of ARVC, as it can provide detailed imaging of the RV structure and function. However, EPS is usually necessary for a definitive diagnosis and to guide management decisions.

Genetic testing (Option C) may be considered in patients with suspected ARVC, especially if a family history is present or if there are additional clinical features suggestive of a genetic syndrome. However, it is not the initial step in the evaluation of this patient.

Implantation of a cardiac defibrillator (Option D) may be necessary if the patient has a high risk for sudden cardiac death, which can be determined through the evaluation with EPS. However, performing the EPS first will help determine the need for an ICD and guide placement if necessary.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in this case is an electrophysiology study (Option B).

A) Arteriovenous malformation of the scalp.

**Reasoning**:
- The patient presents with a progressively enlarging lesion on her left scalp, which she first noticed in high school. This suggests a slow-growing lesion.
- There is no overlying loss of hair or sharp pain associated with the lesion.
- The lesion is described as spongy and pulsatile, indicating a vascular component.
- The MRI shows an ill-defined, intensely enhancing scalp lesion with very prominent vascularity.
- Catheter angiography confirms the hypervascular nature of the lesion, supplied by hypertrophied superficial temporal and occipital arteries.
- The biopsy shows a deep dermal/subcutaneous proliferation of spindle cells without significant nuclear pleomorphism or mitotic activity, and stains positive for S100 and SOX10 immunostains.
- These findings are consistent with an arteriovenous malformation of the scalp.

fill in the letter of the answer)

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation and the histopathologic findings, the most likely diagnosis in this case is A: Chromoblastomycosis.

Chromoblastomycosis is a chronic fungal infection caused by several species of pigmented fungi. It typically presents as erythematous scaly plaques that gradually enlarge and may cause destruction of surrounding tissue. The plaques often have a central scar and can be brown or black in color. The presence of multiple well-defined plaques with scarring, saddle nose deformity, and perforation of the hard palate are consistent with the clinical features of chromoblastomycosis.

Histopathologic analysis plays an important role in confirming the diagnosis. In chromoblastomycosis, there is typically an infiltrate of foamy histiocytes and pigmented yeasts without multiaxial septation, as seen in the skin biopsy obtained in this case.

Hyalohyphomycosis, blastomycosis, and phaeohyphomycosis do not typically present with the specific clinical features and histopathologic findings described in this case.

Reasoning: Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is Acute coalescent mastoiditis with sigmoid sinus thrombosis. The patient presented with left-sided otorrhea, otalgia, and hearing loss, which are consistent with mastoiditis. The magnetic resonance imaging showed diffuse enhancement and possible coalescence in the left mastoid process with adjacent dural enhancement and sigmoid sinus occlusion, confirming the presence of mastoiditis and thrombosis. The histologic findings from the biopsy specimen, including cells with oval nuclei and abundant cytoplasm arranged in syncytial clusters with occasional whorls, pseudoinclusions, and psammomatous calcifications, are consistent with acute inflammation and abscess formation in mastoiditis. Immunohistochemical stains positive for epithelial membrane antigen and vimentin further support the diagnosis of mastoiditis.

Reasoning: Based on the patient's history of travel to Guyana in South America, the presence of neck subcutaneous nodules and cellulitis, and the findings of dense granulomatous inflammation with negative bacterial and fungal stains, the most likely diagnosis is A: Leishmaniasis. Leishmaniasis is a parasitic infection caused by the protozoa Leishmania, commonly transmitted through the bite of infected sand flies in endemic areas like Guyana. The ulceration of the uvula may be a manifestation of mucocutaneous leishmaniasis. Other options like tuberculosis (B), leprosy (C), and lethal midline granuloma (D) are less likely given the patient's clinical presentation and history.

**Reasoning**: In this case, the patient has a known history of mycosis fungoides with widespread skin involvement. The presence of black macules and patches on the tongue, roof of the mouth, and buccal mucosa is consistent with oral involvement of mycosis fungoides. Therefore, the correct diagnosis is D: Oral involvement of mycosis fungoides.

C: Serological testing for onchocerciasis.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation and the patient's history, the irregular serpiginous extension seen in the photograph, along with symptoms of movement in the eye, previous similar episodes, and recent swelling in the face and hand, suggests a possibility of onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness. Onchocerciasis is caused by the parasitic worm Onchocerca volvulus, which is transmitted by black flies. The symptoms and findings in the photograph are consistent with the migration of these worms in the conjunctiva.

Since the patient had immigrated from Nigeria and had not returned since, where onchocerciasis is endemic, it is important to consider this possibility. Serological testing for onchocerciasis can confirm the diagnosis. Treatment with diethylcarbamazine, an antiparasitic medication commonly used for onchocerciasis, may be necessary if the diagnosis is confirmed.

Although exploration of the conjunctiva and removal of foreign body may seem like a potential option, there is no evidence of a visible foreign body in the conjunctiva or any abnormalities on slitlamp examination. Therefore, further investigation to rule out onchocerciasis is the next appropriate step. Peripheral blood smear may not be as specific as serological testing for onchocerciasis.

**Reasoning**: 
Based on the presented case, the patient is a 13-year-old boy with a history of trauma to the left eye. On examination, the pigmented iris lesion was found to have gravitational shifting within the anterior chamber fluid with patient head tilt. The lesion appears to be cystic, with no solid component. The patient is asymptomatic and has normal visual acuity in both eyes.

Given the benign nature of the lesion and the absence of any concerning findings on examination, it is appropriate to choose conservative management and observe the lesion with no additional testing or intervention (Option C). The lesion does not warrant immediate intervention such as fine-needle aspiration biopsy (Option A) or iodine 125 plaque radiotherapy (Option B). Additionally, there is no indication for cyst paracentesis with complete drainage (Option D) as the lesion is cystic and not causing any complications such as increased intraocular pressure or visual disturbances.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to observe the lesion with no additional testing or intervention.

Given the clinical presentation of long-standing thickening and induration of the legs, along with the patient's previous diagnosis of elephantiasis nostras verrucosa, the most likely diagnosis is **B: Elephantiasis nostras verrucosa**.

**Reasoning**:
1. The patient has a history of long-standing thickening and induration of the legs, which is consistent with elephantiasis nostras verrucosa. This condition is characterized by chronic lymphatic obstruction leading to localized lymphedema, fibrosis, and hypertrophic changes in the skin.
2. The patient's physical examination findings of multiple firm skin-colored papules and nodules coalescing to form a large plaque on the anterior aspect of the left lower leg, along with diffuse induration and hyperpigmentation on the right lower leg, are consistent with the typical manifestations of elephantiasis nostras verrucosa.
3. Pretibial myxedema (Option A) is a condition typically associated with autoimmune thyroid disease and manifests as non-pitting edema and induration of the skin on the anterior aspect of the lower legs. This condition is not supported by the patient's history, physical examination findings, or laboratory results.
4. Lobomycosis (Option C) is a chronic cutaneous fungal infection caused by the fungus Lacazia loboi. It usually presents as nodules or plaques on the limbs, and diagnosis is confirmed by fungal culture or biopsy. However, the clinical presentation and history of the patient are not consistent with this rare fungal infection.
5. Euthyroid pretibial mucinosis (Option D) is a localized form of myxedema that occurs in the absence of thyroid dysfunction. It typically presents as non-pitting edema and induration of the skin on the anterior aspect of the lower legs. However, the absence of thyroid dysfunction on laboratory analysis and the patient's history of elephantiasis nostras verrucosa make this diagnosis less likely.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation and information provided, the most likely diagnosis is elephantiasis nostras verrucosa (Option B).

Based on the clinical presentation of multiple itchy erythematous to violaceous papules and plaques localized to the left shin, with close inspection revealing milia and erosions with partially detached epidermis, the most likely diagnosis is Epidermolysis Bullosa Pruriginosa (EBP). EBP is a subtype of Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) characterized by intense pruritus and papules, which can lead to secondary changes such as lichenification, milia, and erosions. There were no abnormalities of the mucous membranes, nails, hair, or teeth, ruling out other possible diagnoses. Histopathological examination revealing dermoepidermal separation further supports the diagnosis of EBP.

B: Order serologic testing for infectious neuroretinitis.

**Reasoning**:
The patient's clinical presentation of painless vision loss, central scotoma, optic disc swelling, and macular star is consistent with neuroretinitis. Neuroretinitis is often associated with infections, most commonly cat-scratch disease caused by Bartonella henselae. Other infectious causes, such as toxoplasmosis, syphilis, or Lyme disease, should also be considered. Therefore, ordering serologic testing for infectious etiologies is the next appropriate step in the diagnostic workup. Systemic corticosteroids may be considered after an infectious cause has been ruled out. Checking blood pressure and ruling out brain tumor may be important for long-term management but are not the next immediate steps in the diagnostic process.

Reasoning: The clinical presentation and imaging findings of a firm, submucosal intramuscular mass in the tongue that has been present since birth and remains proportional in size suggests a benign congenital tumor. Hemangiomas are the most common benign vascular tumors of infancy, but they typically present as soft, compressible masses that rapidly grow in the first few months of life and involute over time. Rhabdomyomas and rhabdomyosarcomas are soft tissue tumors that involve skeletal muscle, but they are exceedingly rare in the tongue and are unlikely based on the clinical presentation. Teratomas are germ cell tumors that typically contain multiple tissue types and have a wide range of imaging appearances, including cystic components, which are not seen in this case. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a benign vascular tumor, specifically a hemangioma.

A: Perform a skin biopsy at the mastectomy incision site

**Reasoning**:
The patient presented with rash and poor wound healing after mastectomy. The skin findings, including erythema, edema, pain, pruritus, and serous fluid drainage at the mastectomy incision sites, along with the development of an erythematous papulovesicular rash on the trunk and extremities, are concerning for a possible allergic or immune-mediated reaction.

Given that the patient also had a similar episode after laparoscopy, it suggests a potential pattern of hypersensitivity reactions. Therefore, performing a skin biopsy at the mastectomy incision site can help determine the underlying cause of the rash and poor wound healing.

Prescribing acyclovir would be appropriate if there were clinical suspicion or confirmation of herpes infection, but the negative bacterial culture result and lack of improvement with antibiotics make this less likely.

Starting topical steroids and performing a skin patch test would be appropriate if there were suspicion of an allergic contact dermatitis, but this would not explain the poor wound healing and delayed wound healing after a previous surgery.

Treating with doxycycline would be appropriate if there were clinical suspicion or confirmation of a bacterial infection, but the negative bacterial culture result and lack of improvement with antibiotics make this less likely. Additionally, the pattern of the skin findings suggests a hypersensitivity reaction rather than an infection.

A) Disseminated fusariosis.

**Reasoning**:
- The patient is immunocompromised due to therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia and has severe neutropenia, which puts her at risk for fungal infections.
- The physical examination findings of dusky, purpuric, and pink papulonodules, some with overlying eschar, scattered on the scalp, neck, trunk, and extremities are consistent with cutaneous manifestations of disseminated fungal infection.
- The CT scan findings of multifocal bilateral ground-glass patchy opacities, scattered solid bilateral pulmonary nodules, and pericardial effusion are suggestive of systemic fungal infection.
- The histopathologic examination and tissue culture reveal septated hyphae and oval microconidia, which are consistent with Fusarium species, a type of mold that can cause invasive fungal infections in immunocompromised patients.

Based on the clinical presentation, physical examination findings, and laboratory and imaging results, the most likely diagnosis is disseminated fusariosis (Option A).

Based on the clinical presentation and histological findings described in the case, the most likely diagnosis is bullous pilomatricoma. Bullous pilomatricoma is a rare variant of pilomatricoma, which is a benign tumor originating from the hair matrix cells. The presence of a red-colored tumor with a hard nodule inside, along with the histological features of basophilic cells, shadow cells, and dilated lymphatic vessels, support the diagnosis of bullous pilomatricoma. Matrical carcinoma, panfolliculoma, and trichodiscoma are less likely diagnoses in this case.

B: Order brain magnetic resonance imaging to look for associated central nervous system tumors.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the patient is likely exhibiting features of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). TSC is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of tumors in various organs, including the brain, skin, kidneys, and eyes.

Given the presence of a unilateral exudative retinal lesion along with other characteristic findings of TSC, such as a long-standing growth on the cheek, lightly pigmented patches of skin, and multiple subungual fibromas, it is important to evaluate for associated central nervous system (CNS) tumors.

Ordering a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is necessary to assess for the presence of CNS tumors, such as cortical tubers, subependymal nodules, and subependymal giant cell astrocytomas, which are common in TSC. This imaging modality can provide detailed visualization of the brain structures and identify any abnormalities that may require further management.

Therefore, the appropriate next step in this case is to order brain MRI to look for associated central nervous system tumors.

B: Check an antisynthetase antibody panel.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the information provided, the patient presents with dysphagia, pulmonary symptoms (cough, dyspnea), weight loss, and positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) findings. These findings are suggestive of a systemic autoimmune disease. The presence of a shawl-like rash on the chest also raises suspicion for dermatomyositis, a connective tissue disease associated with muscle weakness and characteristic skin findings.

To further evaluate the possibility of an underlying autoimmune myopathy, checking an antisynthetase antibody panel would be the next appropriate step. Antisynthetase antibodies are associated with a subgroup of idiopathic inflammatory myopathies, including polymyositis and dermatomyositis. These antibodies can help confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.

Performing a percutaneous lung tissue biopsy or quadriceps muscle biopsy may be considered in certain cases, but initially checking the antisynthetase antibody panel is a more efficient and less invasive step. 

Prescribing prednisone (60 mg daily) without further evaluation or confirmation of the underlying cause would not be appropriate at this stage. Further investigation is needed to identify the underlying autoimmune myopathy before starting specific treatment.

D: Schwannoma

**Reasoning**:
Dysphagia and dyspnea in this case are likely due to the presence of a mass in the left oropharynx and hypopharynx. The imaging findings of a well-circumscribed heterogeneous mass with clear planes separating it from surrounding structures are suggestive of a benign neoplasm. In this case, the most likely diagnosis is a schwannoma, a benign nerve sheath tumor that arises from Schwann cells.

A perineurioma is a rare benign neoplasm that arises from perineurial cells and is typically a slow-growing tumor commonly seen in young to middle-aged adults. It is usually solitary and presents as a painless mass.

Fibroblastic lipoblastoma is a benign tumor composed of immature adipose tissue and fibrous elements. It typically occurs in infants or young children and most commonly presents as a painless, slow-growing mass.

Pediatric fibromyxoid soft tissue tumor is a rare benign soft tissue tumor that can occur in children and young adults. It usually presents as a slow-growing mass in the subcutaneous tissue or deep soft tissues.

Based on the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and the most likely diagnosis of a benign neoplasm involving a nerve sheath, the most appropriate answer is D: Schwannoma.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation of sudden-onset bilateral mydriasis, ophthalmoplegia, unsteady gait, and enhanced nerve roots and oculomotor nerve on MRI, this patient is showing signs of Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS). MFS is a variant of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) characterized by the triad of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia. The presence of sluggish but reactive pupils and new-onset ophthalmoplegia in this case further supports the diagnosis of MFS.

The most appropriate next step in management would be to order anti-GQ1b antibody testing and start intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) therapy. Anti-GQ1b antibodies are detected in about 90% of patients with MFS, and their presence helps to confirm the diagnosis. IVIG is the treatment of choice for MFS, as it has been shown to hasten recovery and improve outcomes.

Repeat blood cultures and starting antibiotics would not be appropriate in this case because there is no evidence of an ongoing infection. Repeat lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid studies would also not be necessary, as the initial lumbar puncture was normal and the MRI findings are consistent with MFS.

Starting intravenous corticosteroids is not recommended in the management of MFS. Corticosteroids have not been shown to be effective in treating MFS and can potentially worsen the disease course.

C: Melanoma

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation, the patient is presenting with a left shoulder mass that has been progressively growing for the past 3 years. The mass is described as fungating, necrotic, and ulcerated. This is concerning for an aggressive malignancy. The punch biopsy shows highly pleomorphic atypical spindle and epithelial cells within the superficial and deep dermis, extending into the subcutaneous tissue, with 18 mitoses/mm2. This histopathological pattern is consistent with melanoma, which is characterized by the presence of pleomorphic cells and high mitotic activity. Immunohistochemistry demonstrates SOX10-positive and pankeratin-negative tumor cells, which are also consistent with melanoma. The whole-body PET-CT scan shows an intensely hypermetabolic left shoulder mass and multiple hypermetabolic enlarged left axillary lymph nodes, indicating an active spread of the malignancy. The absence of distant metastasis on imaging is in favor of an earlier stage of disease.

Based on the clinical presentation of retinal vasculitis and vitritis, along with the patient's history of B-cell lymphoma and active renal cell carcinoma (RCC) receiving cabozantinib therapy, the most appropriate next step would be to stop the cabozantinib and initiate treatment with intravenous solumedrol. Cabozantinib is known to cause ocular side effects, including retinal vasculitis, which may manifest as hazy vision, as seen in this patient. Admitting the patient for intravenous solumedrol will help to manage the underlying inflammatory process and potentially improve the patient's visual symptoms.

B) Order serum tumor marker testing.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation and radiographic findings of complete absence of the left humeral head with associated soft tissue swelling and periarticular calcification, further evaluation for malignancy is warranted. Tumor infiltration or destruction of the humeral head can cause similar radiographic findings. Therefore, ordering serum tumor marker testing would help to assess for the presence of an underlying malignancy.

C: Percutaneous coronary intervention.

**Reasoning**:
The patient's presentation with acute pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, tachycardia, and hypoxemia suggests a cardiac event. The elevated troponin levels and abnormal electrocardiogram findings confirm myocardial damage. The diagnosis of spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) of the left main coronary artery further supports the need for intervention.

Observation alone may not be appropriate in this case due to the severity of the patient's symptoms and the high-risk nature of left main SCAD. Without prompt intervention, there is a risk of further myocardial damage and potentially life-threatening complications.

Medical management, such as antiplatelet therapy and beta-blockers, may be considered as adjunctive treatment, but alone it may not be sufficient in this high-risk situation.

Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is a more invasive procedure and is generally reserved for cases with severe and complex coronary artery disease. In this case, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) would be the preferred initial treatment approach.

Thus, the most appropriate next step would be percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to restore blood flow to the affected artery in order to prevent further myocardial damage and improve outcomes.

B: VEXAS syndrome.

**Reasoning**:
This patient presents with treatment-resistant edematous annular plaques, mild leukopenia, and a negative ANA (antinuclear antibody) screen. The history of fevers, mild neutropenia and lymphopenia, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate are all suggestive of an underlying systemic inflammatory process. The lack of improvement with conventional treatment options raises suspicion for an atypical or rare condition.

Among the answer choices, VEXAS syndrome is the most likely diagnosis based on the clinical features described. VEXAS syndrome is a recently identified, rare autoinflammatory syndrome characterized by vasculopathy, hematologic abnormalities (including leukopenia), and various systemic symptoms. It typically affects older males and is associated with high morbidity and mortality rates.

The negative results for other laboratory tests, such as metabolic panels, HIV, hepatitis serologic tests, and rapid plasma reagin, make other diagnoses less likely.

Therefore, the most appropriate diagnosis for this patient is VEXAS syndrome (Answer B).

A: Pseudoxanthoma elasticum

**Reasoning**:

The patient's clinical presentation of progressive skin laxity, thick and leathery skin folds on the neck, axillae, inguinal regions, abdomen, and limbs, along with the presence of yellowish papules on the dorsal neck, is consistent with pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE). PXE is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive calcification and fragmentation of elastic fibers in the skin, cardiovascular system, and other tissues.

The patient has a low clotting activity of factor X and a prolonged prothrombin time, indicating coagulation deficiency. This is a common finding in patients with PXE.

Although the patient's sister also has similar skin symptoms, there is no mention of any extracutaneous involvement or systemic manifestations. Therefore, the diagnosis of inherited cutis laxa syndrome, which is associated with a variety of systemic findings, is less likely.

The skin biopsy specimen showed excessive calcification of elastic fiber fragments scattered in the reticular dermis, which is a characteristic finding in PXE.

Based on the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and histopathologic examination, the most likely diagnosis is Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE).

**Reasoning**: 

Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is cystic echinococcosis, caused by Echinococcus granulosus infection. The patient's history of close contact with dogs, cattle, and sheep in a rural area known for this infection supports this diagnosis.

To confirm the diagnosis, stool examination for E. granulosus eggs should be performed. The eggs are shed in the feces of infected dogs, and humans can become infected by ingesting food or water contaminated with these eggs. Therefore, checking the stool for E. granulosus eggs will help confirm the presence of the infection.

Obtaining serologic testing for E. granulosus antibodies is another option to confirm the diagnosis. Serologic tests, such as enzyme immunoassays, can detect antibodies against E. granulosus in the patient's blood. However, these tests may not be reliable in all cases, especially in patients with early or inactive infections.

Performing a lung biopsy or liver biopsy is not necessary for the initial evaluation of this patient. The clinical and radiological findings are highly suggestive of a parasitic infection, and biopsy carries risks, such as bleeding and infection.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to check stool for E. granulosus eggs.

C) Send skin biopsy specimen to the US National Hansen’s Disease Program for PCR testing.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the patient's clinical presentation and examination findings, there are several key characteristics that suggest a possible diagnosis of leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease. These include annular skin lesions, numbness and paresthesia in the affected areas, claw-hand deformity, foot drop, and thickened nerves. 

To confirm the diagnosis, it is important to send a skin biopsy specimen to the US National Hansen’s Disease Program for PCR testing. This can help identify the presence of Mycobacterium leprae, the bacterium responsible for causing leprosy.

Additional tests, such as serologic testing for M leprae phenolic glycolipid 1, may also be useful. However, the PCR testing is considered more specific and sensitive for detecting the presence of the bacteria.

Treatment for leprosy usually involves a combination of antibiotics such as dapsone, rifampin, and clofazimine. However, treatment should not be initiated until a definite diagnosis has been established.

Therefore, the next step in the management of this patient would be to send the skin biopsy specimen to the US National Hansen’s Disease Program for PCR testing to confirm the diagnosis of leprosy.

D: Order 24-hour urine testing for monoclonal proteins.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the patient is presenting with multiple symptoms suggestive of different underlying conditions. The unintentional weight loss, chest pain, and shortness of breath with exertion are concerning for heart failure. The edema to the mid-calf bilaterally, high-sensitivity troponin level, brain-type natriuretic peptide level, and cardiomegaly on chest radiograph further support the diagnosis of heart failure.
Additionally, the patient has a history of lumbar spinal stenosis and is presenting with toe numbness and sensory deficits in the lower extremities. The reduced amplitude of peroneal nerve action potentials observed on electromyography suggests axonal sensorimotor polyneuropathy.
The cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy, and the bone scintigraphy scan demonstrated increased cardiac uptake. These findings indicate the possibility of an infiltrative cardiac disease.
Given these findings, further investigation is necessary to rule out the presence of monoclonal proteins, which can be indicative of multiple myeloma or amyloidosis. 24-hour urine testing is a commonly used diagnostic tool to detect monoclonal proteins in patients with suspected gammopathies.
Therefore, performing a 24-hour urine testing for monoclonal proteins is the appropriate next step in the diagnostic evaluation of this patient.

A: Ultrasound biomicroscopy

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation of a 64-year-old woman with redness, diminished vision, and aching pain in the right eye for 8 months, it is important to consider the potential causes for these symptoms. In this case, the patient has dilated corkscrew conjunctival vessels, a shallow anterior chamber, nuclear cataract, and a serous choroidal detachment partly obscuring the optic disc nasally. These findings suggest the possibility of angle-closure glaucoma with choroidal detachment.

Ultrasound biomicroscopy would be the appropriate next step. This imaging technique allows for visualization and assessment of the angle structures, including the position of the ciliary body, lens, and iris. It can help determine if there is angle closure contributing to the patient's symptoms and aid in the diagnosis of choroidal detachment.

Uveitis workup and steroids (option B) may be considered if there are signs or symptoms suggestive of uveitis, such as anterior chamber cells, keratic precipitates, or vitritis. However, in this case, there is no evidence of uveitis, and the clinical findings are more consistent with angle-closure glaucoma.

A thyroid profile (option C) is not indicated based on the clinical presentation and findings described.

Magnetic resonance imaging with magnetic resonance angiography or digital subtraction angiography (option D) may be considered in certain cases, such as when there is suspicion of vascular abnormalities or tumors. However, in this case, the clinical presentation and findings are more consistent with angle-closure glaucoma and choroidal detachment, for which ultrasound biomicroscopy (option A) would be the more appropriate next step.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation, the unilateral deepening of the anterior chamber, signs of anterior uveitis, posterior synechiae, and retinal detachment in the left eye, the most appropriate next step would be to schedule combined phacoemulsification-vitrectomy surgery (Answer D). 

The deepening of the anterior chamber, pupillary block, and posterior synechiae suggest that there may be a blockage or obstruction in the drainage of aqueous humor through the trabecular meshwork. This could be causing increased pressure in the anterior chamber, leading to the deepening and the associated signs of anterior uveitis.

Phacoemulsification alone may not address the underlying cause of the deepening of the anterior chamber and could potentially worsen the condition. Peripheral iridotomy (Answer A) is typically performed as a preventive measure or treatment for angle-closure glaucoma, which does not seem to be the primary issue in this case.

Full-thickness sclerectomy (Answer B) is a surgical procedure used for the management of glaucoma, but it may not be appropriate in this case considering the presence of anterior uveitis and retinal detachment.

Administering intravenous corticosteroids (Answer C) could be beneficial in managing anterior uveitis; however, it does not address the underlying cause of the deepening anterior chamber or retinal detachment.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to schedule combined phacoemulsification-vitrectomy surgery (Answer D) to address both the cataract and the retinal detachment in the left eye.

**Reasoning**: The patient's history of stage 3 cutaneous melanoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, along with the current ophthalmic findings of bilateral panuveitis and pigmentary abnormalities, suggest a possibility of leukemic infiltration in the eye. Despite negative results from other testing, a vitrectomy with vitreous biopsy and chorioretinal biopsy for flow cytometry can provide more definitive evidence to assess for leukemic cells in the eye.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is a schwannoma. 

Parapharyngeal space tumors have a wide range of differential diagnoses including schwannoma, venous malformation, pleomorphic adenoma, and paraganglioma. However, the patient's symptoms of left jaw tightness, aural fullness, and facial discomfort are consistent with a parapharyngeal space mass compressing nearby structures.

The MRI findings of a well-circumscribed, ovoid mass in the left prestyloid parapharyngeal space, which is isointense on T1-weighted imaging, hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging, and demonstrates heterogeneous enhancement following gadolinium administration, are consistent with a schwannoma. 

The histopathologic evaluation of a well-circumscribed 12-mm mass further supports the diagnosis of a schwannoma.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation, the patient has a history of recurrent high-grade serous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary, which is known for its potential to metastasize. The patient developed left-sided facial weakness and swelling after cycle 4 of chemotherapy, suggesting a potential side effect of the treatment. The physical examination findings, including left lower-motor-neuron type of facial nerve palsy, are consistent with a neurological manifestation. The MRI of the brain did not show any neuroparenchymal or meningeal lesions, ruling out other causes of facial nerve palsy. However, imaging demonstrated findings in the maxillary sinuses, including mucosal thickening and bony destruction with foci of remodeling, which are more indicative of metastatic involvement rather than primary sinus pathology. Therefore, the most appropriate diagnosis in this case is metastases from ovarian primary.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation of an elderly patient with progressive weakness, fatigue, and the development of ecchymotic plaques on the scalp, along with the presence of violaceous and skin-colored plaques on the chest and lower back, the differential diagnosis includes hematologic malignancies with cutaneous involvement.

Metastatic renal cell carcinoma (Choice A) typically presents with renal symptoms and spreads to other organs, such as the lungs or bones, before involving the skin. Additionally, the biopsy findings of basophilic blastoid cells and CD123 staining are not consistent with renal cell carcinoma.

Epithelioid angiosarcoma (Choice C) is a rare aggressive vascular malignancy, but it typically presents as a deep-seated subcutaneous mass, rather than as plaques. The biopsy findings of basophilic blastoid cells and CD123 staining are not consistent with angiosarcoma.

Myeloid leukemia cutis (Choice D) refers to the infiltration of leukemic blast cells into the skin and typically occurs in the setting of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the clinical presentation of an elderly patient with ecchymotic plaques and the biopsy findings of basophilic blastoid cells and CD123 staining are more consistent with blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN).

Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (Choice B) is a rare hematologic malignancy that primarily affects the skin, but it can also involve the bone marrow and other organs. It typically presents in older adults with cutaneous lesions resembling bruise-like violaceous plaques. The biopsy findings of basophilic blastoid cells and CD123 staining, along with the clinical presentation, are consistent with BPDCN.

C: Fibromuscular dysplasia 

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and examination findings, the most likely diagnosis in this case is fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD). 

1. Clinical presentation: The patient presented with new-onset occipital headache of mild to moderate severity with pulsating character. This is a common symptom in FMD.

2. Seizures and altered consciousness: The patient had generalized tonic-clonic seizures followed by altered consciousness. Although not specific to FMD, these neurological symptoms can be associated with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), which can be triggered by severe hypertension.

3. Hypertension: The patient had severe hypertension with a blood pressure of 170/110 mm Hg. The presence of abdominal bruit suggests renovascular hypertension, which is commonly seen in FMD. Additionally, the ultrasound and CT angiography findings of right renal artery narrowing and abdominal aortic thickening support the diagnosis.

4. Fundus examination: The presence of papilledema and changes of hypertensive retinopathy further indicates severe hypertension, often associated with FMD.

5. Imaging findings: The cranial magnetic resonance imaging showed bilateral white matter hyperintensity, which is consistent with reversible vasogenic edema seen in PRES. The repeat imaging showed a significant reduction in the white matter hyperintensity, indicating improvement.

Based on these findings, fibromuscular dysplasia is the most likely diagnosis in this case.

B) Obtain skin biopsy with T-cell clonality studies.

**Reasoning:**
The patient presents with a diffuse cutaneous eruption involving the scalp, face, trunk, and extremities. The lesions are described as coalescing salmon-colored plaques with areas of sparing on the abdomen. The presence of waxy, exfoliative scale on the palms and soles and ectropion are also noted. Given these findings, several differential diagnoses should be considered, including cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), specifically the mycosis fungoides variant.

Skin biopsy with T-cell clonality studies is essential in evaluating patients with suspected CTCL. CTCL is characterized by the clonal expansion of malignant T-lymphocytes in the skin. T-cell clonality studies can help identify the presence of a dominant clone of T-lymphocytes, supporting the diagnosis of CTCL. Immunophenotyping can then be performed to further classify the specific CTCL subtype.

Ordering a myositis-specific autoantibody panel (A) would not be indicated in this case as the patient's presentation is not suggestive of myositis.

Testing for anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody (C) is typically associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which is not consistent with the patient's clinical presentation.

Ordering testing for HLA-B27 (D) would not be relevant in this case as it is primarily associated with inflammatory conditions such as ankylosing spondylitis and reactive arthritis, which do not fit the patient's presentation.

**Reasoning**:
The black discoloration of the patient's tongue is consistent with a condition known as "black tongue". Black tongue is a benign condition characterized by hyperpigmentation of the filiform papillae on the dorsal surface of the tongue. It is typically caused by an overgrowth of bacteria or fungi on the tongue, leading to staining of the papillae. The condition is generally asymptomatic and does not require treatment.

Given the patient's history and clinical presentation, it is unlikely that black tongue is related to the current hospitalization or treatment with cefazolin. There are no specific indications to measure serum cortisol levels or perform a tongue biopsy in this case.

B: Dermoid cyst.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation and histologic examination described in the case, the most likely diagnosis is a dermoid cyst. Dermoid cysts are benign developmental cysts that can occur in various locations in the body, including the oropharynx. They typically contain ectodermal and mesodermal components, which is consistent with the findings in this case. The presence of a pedunculated rubbery mass arising from the tonsillar pillar, covered with keratinizing squamous epithelium, and containing pilosebaceous units (hair follicles, arrector pili muscles, and sebaceous glands) supports the diagnosis of a dermoid cyst. Teratomas are similar to dermoid cysts but often contain more complex structures such as teeth, bone, and cartilage. Hairy pharyngeal polyps are usually polypoid masses arising from the nasopharynx and are not typically associated with dermal structures. Squamous papilloma is a benign epithelial neoplasm characterized by finger-like projections covered by squamous epithelium, which is not consistent with the findings described in the case.

C: Order genetic workup. 

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation of nystagmus, along with the patient's medical history and examination findings, ordering a genetic workup would be the next appropriate step.

The patient has a complex medical history including esophageal atresia, small bowel obstruction, mild cognitive impairment, low tone, and increased reflexes. These findings suggest a possible syndromic or genetic cause for her symptoms, rather than an isolated eye-related issue.

The presence of nystagmus since birth and the absence of any family history of ocular disease further support the possibility of an underlying genetic condition.

A genetic workup can help identify any potential genetic abnormalities or syndromes that may be causing the patient's symptoms. This may involve genetic testing such as chromosomal microarray analysis, targeted gene sequencing, or whole exome sequencing.

Reviewing the brain MRI and ordering an electroretinogram can be considered in the diagnostic workup, but given the patient's complex medical history and the presence of nystagmus since birth, a genetic workup would be a more comprehensive approach to evaluate for any underlying genetic abnormalities or syndromes. Strabismus surgery and treating with clonazepam would not address the underlying cause of the nystagmus and are not appropriate initial management options in this case.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is a non-infectious neutrophilic dermatosis that presents as painful, rapidly progressing cutaneous ulcers with undermined borders. It is often associated with underlying systemic conditions, such as myelodysplastic syndrome in this case.

Leukemia cutis would present with infiltration of immature myeloid or lymphoid cells in the skin, which was not seen in the histopathological findings of this patient's skin lesions.

Reasoning: 

Based on the clinical presentation of a pink, dome-shaped papule with overlying vessels on the scalp, along with the patient's history of multiple squamous cell carcinomas, the most likely diagnosis is an angioleiomyoma (Choice B). 

Angioleiomyomas are benign smooth muscle tumors that commonly present as tender, dome-shaped papules on the extremities or trunk. They are often associated with overlying vessels and can be painful to touch.

Symplastic glomus tumors (Choice A) are rare neoplasms that typically present in subungual locations and are characterized by paroxysmal pain and tenderness, which are not described in this case.

Solitary fibrous tumors (Choice C) are rare fibroblastic mesenchymal neoplasms that most commonly occur in the pleura. They typically present as slow-growing, painless masses and have a variable appearance on histopathological examination.

Malignant myopericytoma (Choice D) is a rare malignant perivascular tumor that can occur in various locations. It is typically a larger, infiltrative lesion and is unlikely based on the size and clinical presentation described in this case.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is an angioleiomyoma (Choice B).

C) Acquired progressive lymphangioma

**Reasoning**:

The patient in this case presents with multiple, slowly growing, infiltrated erythematous-violaceous patches and plaques on her left upper arm and left side of the chest. These lesions have irregular borders and are firm, nonscaly, and purple in color. No triggers, such as local infection, insect bite, or trauma, occurred before the appearance of the lesions, and the patient denies fever, weight loss, or fatigue. There is no extracutaneous involvement observed.

The histopathological examination of the skin biopsy specimen shows irregularly branched, thin-walled blood vessels dissecting through collagen bundles within the superficial to mid dermis. These vessels have plump endothelial cells dispersed between thickened collagen bundles without signs of atypia. The endothelial cells are positive for cluster of differentiation (CD) 31.

The clinical presentation, along with the histopathological findings, are consistent with acquired progressive lymphangioma. This condition is characterized by the proliferation of lymphatic vessels in the skin, leading to the formation of erythematous-violaceous patches and plaques. It typically affects adults, with a female predominance, and often presents on the upper extremities and trunk.

Therefore, the correct diagnosis for this case is C) Acquired progressive lymphangioma.

This patient presented with acute respiratory distress following percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and subsequent administration of amiodarone. The radiographic findings and clinical presentation are consistent with drug-induced pulmonary toxicity. Given the symptoms of pulmonary edema and the development of infiltrates on chest radiography, it is important to assess the plasma level of amiodarone to determine if it is within the therapeutic range. High levels of amiodarone have been associated with pulmonary toxicity. Therefore, checking the amiodarone plasma level would be the next appropriate step to evaluate the potential role of amiodarone in the development of the pulmonary edema.

Reasoning: 

Given the patient's history of syncope, episodes of fast polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PVT), and frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), there is concern for a potentially life-threatening arrhythmia. The presence of a 50% stenosis in the left circumflex artery on coronary angiography may indicate an underlying structural heart disease, which can increase the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. 

Option A: Implant a defibrillator - This would be a reasonable consideration given the potential for life-threatening arrhythmias and the presence of structural heart disease. However, before proceeding with an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), further evaluation is warranted.

Option B: Perform provocative drug testing with procainamide - This option may be considered to induce and unmask any potential arrhythmias. However, given the patient's history of syncope and fast PVT, immediate intervention is needed to prevent further adverse events.

Option C: Start nadolol - Nadolol is a non-selective beta-blocker that can be used for the treatment of PVCs. However, this option does not address the potential risk of life-threatening arrhythmias seen in this patient.

Option D: Ablate PVCs - Radiofrequency ablation may be considered for patients with symptomatic PVCs refractory to medical therapy. However, in this case, the primary concern is the presence of life-threatening arrhythmias and it is important to stabilize the patient first.

Therefore, the best next step would be to implant a defibrillator (Option A) to provide immediate protection against potentially fatal arrhythmias.

Symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and the presence of gallstones in the ileum seen on CT scan are consistent with this diagnosis. The CT scan also shows a thickened gallbladder with air and gallstones adherent to the duodenum, suggesting a gallstone-duodenal fistula. 

Gallstone ileus is a surgical emergency and requires immediate intervention. The most appropriate next step would be to perform an emergency exploratory laparotomy to remove the obstructing gallstone(s) and repair any associated fistulas. This procedure would relieve the obstruction and prevent further complications.

Administering barium through the nasogastric tube to evaluate for bowel obstruction is not recommended as it may worsen the obstruction or lead to bowel perforation due to the increased pressure caused by the obstructing gallstone.

Ordering magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) would not provide the necessary intervention required in this emergency situation. MRCP may show the fistula, but it would not be a definitive treatment option.

Planning for surgical intervention after intravenous fluid resuscitation in the ICU would not be appropriate in this case. The patient's hypotension and signs of systemic inflammation indicate a need for immediate surgical intervention.

C: Order measurement of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) level.

**Reasoning**:
In this case, the patient presents with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and a petechial rash. The presence of a purpuric rash raises suspicion for a systemic vasculitis. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) testing is an important diagnostic tool for evaluating patients with suspected vasculitis, including microscopic polyangiitis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener granulomatosis). These conditions can present with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and skin manifestations. Therefore, ordering a measurement of ANCA levels would help to further evaluate the cause of the patient's symptoms and skin findings.

**Reasoning**: In this patient with CMV viremia and retinitis, who has documented resistance to foscarnet and ganciclovir, and has not responded to intravitreal injections of these medications, the next step would be to consider alternative treatment options. Multivirus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are a potential treatment option in this case. CTLs can be used to target and destroy CMV-infected cells, providing a way to overcome resistance to antiviral medications. Therefore, option B is the appropriate next step in managing this patient.

C: High-grade carcinoma of the breast with occult primary.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the provided clinical case, the patient presented with a palpable left axillary mass and had a history of undergoing a hysterectomy and taking estradiol for postmenopausal symptoms. This suggests that the primary tumor could be related to breast cancer, as estrogen exposure is a known risk factor for breast cancer. 

The bilateral diagnostic mammography showed no abnormalities in the breasts, indicating that the primary tumor is likely occult (not detectable) in the breast tissue. The ultrasound and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) both confirmed the presence of a mass in the left axilla without any breast lesions. 

The biopsy examination revealed high-grade adenocarcinoma with papillary features, which is consistent with a high-grade carcinoma. Immunostaining revealed positive results for PAX8, consistent with breast origin. 

Thus, the most likely diagnosis is high-grade carcinoma of the breast with occult primary.

C: Cervical chondrocutaneous branchial remnant

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is a cervical chondrocutaneous branchial remnant. This is supported by the presence of a slowly growing hump-like mass on the anterior border of the left sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) since birth, with a yellowish, hairy surface and cartilage-like consistency. Ultrasonography revealed an avascular, bulging nodule with an anechoic tubular structure extending to the subcutaneous fat and reaching the surface of the muscular layer, consistent with the presence of cartilage. MRI demonstrated a protuberant nodule with slight hyperintensity on T1WI and hyperintense foci on fat-suppressed T2WI, further supporting the diagnosis.

The other options can be ruled out based on the specific findings in this case:
- Branchial cleft cysts typically present as cystic masses along the anterior border of the SCM, without the presence of hair or cartilage. 
- Epidermoid cysts are usually subcutaneous masses, not associated with cartilage or the presence of hair. 
- Hair follicle nevus does not typically present with the presence of cartilage.

C: Soft tissue aneurysmal bone cyst.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and pathology, the most likely diagnosis is a soft tissue aneurysmal bone cyst. 

1. Clinical presentation: The patient had a painless, slowly enlarging neck mass for 8 months. There were no overlying skin changes or cutaneous involvement. The mass was firm, fixed, and well-circumscribed, without systemic symptoms or lymphadenopathy.

2. Imaging findings: Ultrasound imaging demonstrated a hypoechoic mass. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a well-circumscribed mass with mainly soft tissue density and contrast enhancement.

3. Pathology: The excised mass had cyst-like spaces filled with serous fluid, walls of spindle-shaped fibroblasts, osteoclast-type giant cells, and thin trabeculae of woven bone surfaced with osteoblasts. These findings are consistent with aneurysmal bone cyst. Local infiltration into surrounding skeletal muscle was also noted.

4. USP6 locus rearrangement: The lesion was positive for USP6 locus rearrangement on fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). This molecular finding is diagnostic of aneurysmal bone cyst.

Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is a soft tissue aneurysmal bone cyst (Choice C).

**Reasoning**: Based on the clinical history and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis in this case is C) Median raphe cyst. 

Dyspareunia refers to pain during sexual intercourse, which can be associated with the presence of a cyst or other abnormality. The recurrent purulent discharge suggests an ongoing infection in the area. 

The physical examination findings of an erythematous pinpoint orifice on the glans penis with peripheral telangiectasias and a linear bluish structure on dermoscopy are consistent with the features of a median raphe cyst. Median raphe cyst is a benign, developmental cyst that typically presents as a midline cystic structure on the glans penis or penile shaft. The bluish linear structure seen on dermoscopy is likely due to vascular congestion associated with the cyst.

Ultrasonography findings of a hypoechoic focal zone in the parenchyma of the glans with multiple hyperechoic bilaminar structures further support the diagnosis of a cyst in the affected area.

A biopsy was performed to confirm the diagnosis, with the histological appearance likely showing a cyst lined by stratified squamous epithelium.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is C) Median raphe cyst.

B: Perform a skin biopsy for histopathology and direct immunofluorescence

**Reasoning**:
Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, a skin biopsy for histopathology and direct immunofluorescence would be the next step in the evaluation of this patient. The presence of spontaneous blisters, hyperpigmented macules, and a tingling sensation in the affected area raises concerns for a potential underlying autoimmune blistering disorder. A skin biopsy with histopathology and direct immunofluorescence can help to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.

Aspirating the bullae with a sterile needle and covering with a clean dressing would address the immediate concern of blister management, but it would not provide a definitive diagnosis or guide treatment for the underlying cause.

Starting oral prednisone or treating with oral cephalexin would be premature without a confirmed diagnosis. These treatment options would need to be tailored based on the specific diagnosis and underlying etiology, which can be determined through the skin biopsy.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a skin biopsy for histopathology and direct immunofluorescence.

A) Request a magnetic resonance image of orbits and sinuses.

**Reasoning**:
The patient presents with sudden painless vision loss in the right eye along with a 4-week history of right ear pain and fullness, discomfort over frontal and maxillary sinuses, and nasal congestion without discharge. These symptoms suggest a possible sinus or orbital pathology that may be causing the vision loss.

Additionally, the patient has other systemic symptoms including night sweats, weight loss, and leukocytosis, which can be concerning for an underlying infection or inflammatory process.

Given the ocular findings of a cherry red spot in the macula and thickening of inner retinal layers seen on optical coherence tomography, further imaging with a magnetic resonance image (MRI) of orbits and sinuses can help identify any structural abnormalities or inflammation involving the sinuses or surrounding structures that may be causing the monocular vision loss.

Therefore, the next step would be to request a magnetic resonance image of orbits and sinuses (Option A) to screen for any possible causes of the patient's monocular vision loss and associated symptoms.

Reasoning:
This patient has acute-onset orbital inflammation with worsening symptoms despite initial antibiotic therapy. The imaging findings of diffuse enhancement of the intraconal and extraconal fat, edema and enhancement of extraocular muscles, and thickening of the sphenoid sinus suggest a possible fungal etiology. Invasive fungal sinusitis can present with orbital involvement in immunocompromised patients, such as those with multiple myeloma. Given the lack of improvement with broad-spectrum antibiotics and the concerning imaging findings, the next step would be to start antifungal therapy (Answer A) to cover for possible invasive fungal sinusitis.

A) Obtain blood cultures, perform vitreous tap, and inject antibiotics.

**Reasoning**:
The patient presented with acute chest pain and respiratory insufficiency after starting acetazolamide for uncontrolled increased intraocular pressure. This suggests a potential adverse reaction or complication related to the medication. The patient also had a low hemoglobin level and hematocrit level, which may indicate an underlying infection.
It is important to rule out any systemic infection or endophthalmitis in this patient. Obtaining blood cultures can help identify the presence of any systemic infection that may be causing the symptoms. Performing a vitreous tap and injecting antibiotics can help rule out endophthalmitis, which is an infection within the eye that can occur after intraocular surgery.
Therefore, the next step would be to obtain blood cultures, perform a vitreous tap, and inject antibiotics to investigate and potentially treat any infection that may be present.

**Reasoning**: 

Based on the provided information, the patient has a history of metastatic breast cancer with progressive disease despite multiple lines of treatment. She developed a rash after receiving capecitabine, which worsened over time.

Cutaneous deposits of metastatic breast cancer (Choice A) may present with skin involvement, but the rash described in the case does not fit the typical description of cutaneous metastases. Cutaneous metastases usually present as firm nodules or plaques, and they tend to follow the distribution of lymphatic drainage from the primary tumor.

Inflammation of actinic keratoses (Choice B) is unlikely as the rash does not appear to be limited to sun-exposed areas, and it does not match the description or typical presentation of actinic keratoses. Actinic keratoses are usually scaly or rough patches or plaques that develop on sun-exposed skin.

Medication hypersensitivity reaction (Choice C) is a possibility given the timing of the rash after starting capecitabine. Medications can cause various hypersensitivity reactions, including drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome, which can present with pruritic, erythematous, and scaly rash. However, additional information is needed to confirm this diagnosis, such as laboratory investigations and a thorough medication history.

Discoid lupus erythematosus (Choice D) is less likely in this case. While lupus erythematosus can cause a rash and can be associated with photosensitivity, the patient does not have typical findings such as involvement of the palms and soles, and there is no mention of other systemic symptoms commonly seen in lupus erythematosus.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is medication hypersensitivity reaction (Choice C).

**Reasoning**: Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is a granular cell tumor. Granular cell tumors are rare neoplasms that can occur in various locations, including the respiratory tract. They are usually benign, slow-growing tumors that originate from Schwann cells. In this case, the mass in the distal cervical trachea is described as exophytic and pedunculated, which is consistent with the appearance of a granular cell tumor. The mass was successfully excised and the attachment site ablated, which is the typical treatment for these tumors. Therefore, the correct answer is D: Granular cell tumor.

C) Cholesteatoma

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical findings, the patient presented with unilateral middle ear effusion and conductive hearing loss. During the tympanostomy tube insertion, a clear liquid pulsating from the middle ear was observed, and the analysis confirmed the presence of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak. The imaging findings showed osteolysis involving the petrous part of the right temporal bone, soft tissue opacification of the right mastoid air cells, and a suspected communication into the soft tissues of the right neck.

Cholesteatoma is a benign growth of epithelial cells that can develop in the middle ear. It can lead to chronic inflammation, erosion of bone, and possible complications such as CSF leak. The lytic aspect of the temporal bone and the soft tissue opacification observed in the imaging are consistent with the findings in cholesteatoma.

Gorham-Stout disease is a rare bone disorder characterized by the excessive resorption of bone. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a disorder involving the abnormal proliferation of Langerhans cells, leading to bone lesions. Sarcoma is a malignant tumor of the connective tissues.

The patient has a history of long-term hydroxyurea therapy for essential thrombocytosis (ET). The presence of numerous, primarily photodistributed, crusted, and ulcerated plaques on the trunk and extremities suggest a possible adverse effect of hydroxyurea therapy. 

Option A: Hydroxyurea-induced ulcerations - This could be a possible diagnosis considering the patient's history of hydroxyurea therapy and the presence of ulcerated plaques. 

Option B: Hydroxyurea-induced squamous dysplasia - Squamous dysplasia typically presents as hyperkeratotic or erythematous plaques rather than ulcerations. 

Option C: Hydroxyurea-induced phototoxic eruption - Phototoxic eruptions usually present as erythematous or eczematous reactions rather than ulcerated plaques. 

Option D: Iatrogenic epidermodysplasia verruciformis - This condition is typically caused by infection with specific human papillomavirus (HPV) types and presents with verrucous lesions rather than ulcerated plaques.

D) Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical history and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is juvenile hyaline fibromatosis. This rare autosomal recessive disorder is characterized by the development of multiple subcutaneous nodules and hard masses on the scalp, hands, feet, trunk, and lower extremities. The nodules are typically painless and have a hard texture.

The patient's history of developing subcutaneous masses at a young age, followed by recurrence and gradual increase in size and number, is consistent with the progressive nature of juvenile hyaline fibromatosis.

The lack of tenderness, swelling, or other skin manifestations helps to distinguish juvenile hyaline fibromatosis from other conditions with similar clinical features.

Other conditions considered in the differential diagnosis include infantile myofibromatosis, Mafucci syndrome, and lipoid proteinosis. However, infantile myofibromatosis typically presents in infancy and childhood, while Mafucci syndrome is characterized by the presence of multiple enchondromas in addition to soft tissue masses. Lipoid proteinosis is associated with hoarseness of voice and skin manifestations, which are not present in this case.

**Reasoning**:
The patient in this case has recurrent Torsade de Pointes (TdP) which is a life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia that is characterized by a twisting of the QRS complexes around the isoelectric line. TdP is often associated with a prolonged QT interval on the ECG and can be caused or exacerbated by electrolyte disturbances, medications, and other factors.

In this case, the patient's magnesium level is low at 1.7 mg/dL (normal range: 1.7-2.2 mg/dL) which can contribute to the development of TdP. Hypomagnesemia is a known risk factor for TdP and correcting the magnesium deficiency is important in managing this arrhythmia.

Therefore, the next step would be to start intravenous magnesium (Choice C) to correct the magnesium deficiency and potentially suppress the TdP. Once the patient's magnesium level is normalized, further evaluation and consideration of other treatment options may be necessary.

**Answer**: C) Start intravenous magnesium.

Reasoning: Based on the patient's symptoms of acute onset dyspnea along with retrosternal chest pain, along with the sudden development of symptoms during cardiac catheterization, the most likely diagnosis is acute pulmonary edema. This can occur as a complication of balloon mitral valvotomy due to sudden release of severe mitral stenosis, leading to increased left atrial and pulmonary venous pressures.

Considering the patient's stable blood pressure, pulse, and oxygen saturation, the initial management would focus on alleviating the symptoms and improving oxygenation. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to administer 100% oxygen, provide intravenous fluid for volume expansion, and place the patient in the Trendelenburg position. These measures aim to improve oxygenation and preload while minimizing the afterload.

Pericardiocentesis would not be indicated in this scenario, as there is no evidence of cardiac tamponade. Intravenous thrombolysis and catheter-directed thromboembolectomy are not appropriate options, as there is no evidence or suspicion of pulmonary embolism in this case.

C: Obtain aqueous fluid for fungal polymerase chain reaction

**Reasoning**:

In this case, the 81-year-old woman presents with darkly pigmented corneal lesions following cataract surgery. The lesions are affecting the corneal endothelium and stroma, and the patient has a history of low-grade anterior uveitis and is using loteprednol eye drops. This presentation raises concern for possible fungal infection.

Given the possibility of a fungal infection, obtaining aqueous fluid for fungal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) would be the next appropriate step. This test can help identify the presence of fungal pathogens and guide treatment decisions.

Increasing the frequency of topical corticosteroids (option A) may not be appropriate without confirming the etiology of the lesions.

Referring the patient to an ocular oncologist (option B) may not be necessary at this point, as there is no evidence of malignant or neoplastic lesions.

Obtaining a vitreous biopsy for bacterial culture (option D) would not be the first step in this case, as there is no evidence to suggest a bacterial infection at this time.

C: Angiosarcoma.

**Reasoning**:

The patient's history and clinical presentation suggest the possibility of angiosarcoma. Angiosarcoma is a malignant vascular tumor that can occur in the skin, soft tissues, and various organs. In this case, the patient has a history of mycosis fungoides (MF) and previous radiation therapy, both of which can increase the risk of developing secondary malignancies such as angiosarcoma.

The recurrent hemorrhagic and friable nodules on the left lateral hip are consistent with the characteristics of angiosarcoma. The presence of bleeding, nodules, and the previous history of chronic ulcerations at the site of previously irradiated tumors further support this diagnosis.

Although atypical infections, such as nocardia, can occur in immunocompromised individuals, the absence of systemic symptoms and the characteristic appearance of the lesions make this less likely. Opportunistic fungal infections are also a possibility in immunocompromised patients, but the lack of evidence showing fungal involvement (no evidence on histology or imaging) makes this less likely as well. Granulation tissue, while a valid consideration, does not explain the bleeding and friable nature of the nodules.

Therefore, based on the given information, the most likely diagnosis is angiosarcoma (Choice C).

Reasoning: The patient presented with orbital proptosis, sinus symptoms, and systemic symptoms (photophobia, headache), suggesting an underlying systemic disease. The imaging findings of bilateral sinus opacification and orbital fat stranding, along with the biopsy showing lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates, are consistent with IgG4-related disease, which is characterized by chronic inflammation and fibrosis. The elevated IgG4 levels also support this diagnosis. Graves disease typically presents with symmetrical proptosis and involvement of the extraocular muscles, which is not seen in this case. Invasive fungal sinusitis would typically show necrosis and purulence in the sinus mucosa, which was not seen on biopsy. Sarcoidosis can involve the orbit and sinuses, but it typically presents with granulomatous inflammation, which was not seen on biopsy. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is IgG4-related disease.

B: Immunotherapy-related inflammation

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation and course of the tumor after neoadjuvant immunotherapy, several factors point towards immunotherapy-related inflammation as the cause.

1. Timing: The redness and swelling of the tumor site appeared 3 days after initiating immunotherapy and subsequently developed into a white head over the tumor. This suggests an acute inflammatory response following treatment.

2. Absence of pain and fever: The patient did not experience pain and remained afebrile throughout the process, which is not typically associated with an infection.

3. Serial wound cultures and absence of leukocytosis: The absence of pathogenic growth in the wound cultures and the lack of leukocytosis in laboratory results on multiple days suggest that there is no active infection.

4. Spontaneous cessation of drainage: The drainage from the tumor stopped spontaneously on posttreatment day 10, which is not typical of an ongoing infection or suppuration.

Considering these factors, the most likely diagnosis is immunotherapy-related inflammation as a result of neoadjuvant immunotherapy treatment.

D) Angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma. 

**Reasoning**: 

The key features in this case that help us arrive at the correct diagnosis are the history of a previous injury, the persistent pain and bruise, and the appearance of an ill-defined blue-green plaque on examination. These findings are consistent with the clinical presentation of angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma.

Pigmented epithelioid melanocytoma (choice A) is a rare tumor that typically presents with a blue-black plaque or nodule. However, it is not associated with a history of trauma or persistent pain, making this diagnosis less likely.

Hemosiderotic fibrolipomatous tumor (choice B) is a benign tumor that is typically associated with chronic hemorrhage, but it does not present as an ill-defined blue-green plaque. Additionally, the patient denies any personal or family history of bleeding disorders, making this diagnosis less likely.

Pigmented dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (Bednar tumor) (choice C) is a variant of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, a slow-growing tumor that typically presents as a firm plaque that may have hyperpigmentation. However, it is usually painless and does not have an ill-defined blue-green appearance as described in the case.

In summary, based on the clinical presentation and examination findings, as well as the imaging results, the most likely diagnosis in this case is angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma.

C: Eosinophilic, polymorphic, and pruritic eruption associated with radiotherapy (EPPER)

**Reasoning**:
- The patient's rash started on the legs and subsequently progressed to other parts of the body, including the arms, hands, and trunk. This distribution pattern is consistent with radiation-induced skin reactions.
- The patient's medical history is significant for endometrial adenocarcinoma and recent postoperative radiotherapy. The onset of the rash occurred 4 days after the completion of radiotherapy, suggesting a correlation with the treatment.
- The physical examination findings, including erythematous edematous coalescing papules and plaques, as well as annular and polycyclic configuration with central hyperpigmentation, are characteristic of EPPER.
- The biopsy results demonstrate a moderately dense perivascular and interstitial infiltrate of mononuclear cells with numerous eosinophils, which further supports the diagnosis of EPPER.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation, medical history, physical examination findings, and biopsy results, the most likely diagnosis is Eosinophilic, polymorphic, and pruritic eruption associated with radiotherapy (EPPER).

C: Transthoracic echocardiogram.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation, the patient experienced chest discomfort, diaphoresis, and shortness of breath, which are suggestive of a cardiac event. The patient's initial ECG showed wide complex tachycardia, and subsequent telemetry showed nonsustained ventricular tachycardia. These findings, along with a dilated right ventricle with reduced systolic function and late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, suggest an underlying structural abnormality, possibly arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC).

A transthoracic echocardiogram is indicated to further evaluate the patient's cardiac structure and systolic function. It can assess for any abnormalities in the ventricles, including wall motion abnormalities, dilatation, or signs of infiltrative or restrictive cardiomyopathies. This information can help guide management decisions, such as determining the need for implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for secondary prevention of ventricular arrhythmias.

Cardiac positron emission tomography (PET) may be considered in certain cases to evaluate for myocardial ischemia or viability, but in this case, the patient's coronary arteries were found to be patent on cardiac catheterization. Therefore, there is no indication for a PET scan at this time.

An electrophysiology (EP) study may be considered in patients with sustained ventricular tachycardia or other high-risk arrhythmias to guide further management. However, in this case, the patient had nonsustained ventricular tachycardia and already received synchronized cardioversion, suggesting successful termination of the arrhythmia. Therefore, an EP study would not be the next step in management.

Given the patient's clinical presentation and imaging findings, a transthoracic echocardiogram would provide important information about the underlying cardiac structure and function, guiding further management decisions.

C) Rickettsial infection.

**Reasoning**: The patient presents with severe neck pain, accompanied by swelling and persistent dull pain of the upper anterior chest wall. The pain is exacerbated when turning his head, and is followed by an electric shocklike numbness on the ipsilateral side tongue. These symptoms, along with the signal abnormality in the C1/C2 vertebrae seen on MRI, suggest an inflammatory process involving the cervical spine.

Additionally, the patient has pustules on both hands, which gradually increased in the past 3 days. The presence of pustules, along with an elevated ESR and CRP level, suggests an infectious etiology.

Given the negative results of the workup for other rheumatic and infectious diseases, and the absence of malignancy on whole-body PET/CT, the most likely diagnosis in this case is a rickettsial infection.

**Reasoning**: Given the clinical presentation of gray-white ulcers on the soft palate, uvula, and tonsils, along with the patient's history of sexual contact, the most likely diagnosis is syphilis. Syphilis can present with mucosal ulcerations, and the presence of bilateral submandibular lymphadenopathy further supports this diagnosis.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient would be to obtain serologic test results for Treponema pallidum, the bacterium that causes syphilis. Serologic testing can help confirm the diagnosis of syphilis and determine the stage of the infection.

Performing a biopsy of the gray-white plaque may be considered if there is diagnostic uncertainty or if other causes need to be ruled out, but given the classic presentation and clinical suspicion for syphilis, obtaining serologic tests would be a more appropriate initial step.

Prescribing oral amoxicillin is not the correct choice in this case. While amoxicillin can be used to treat other oral infections such as streptococcal pharyngitis, it is not the preferred treatment for syphilis. Syphilis requires specific antibiotics such as penicillin.

Starting topical nystatin is also not the correct choice in this case. Topical nystatin is typically used to treat oral candidiasis (thrush), which presents as white plaques that can be easily wiped off. The gray-white pseudomembranous appearance in this case suggests a different etiology, such as syphilis.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to obtain serologic test results for Treponema pallidum (Answer A).

C: Positron emission tomography scan.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the patient's history and examination findings, there are several key factors that need to be considered in order to determine the next step in management.

1. Choroidal lesion and subretinal fluid: The patient has an amelanotic choroidal lesion with associated subretinal fluid. This raises concern for a malignant tumor, such as choroidal melanoma or metastatic carcinoma.

2. Family history of malignancy: The patient has a significant family history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and leukemia, which increases the suspicion for a possible metastatic malignancy.

3. Leopard-spotting pattern on fundus autofluorescence: The presence of hyperautofluorescence in a leopard-spotting pattern suggests the presence of multiple areas of increased metabolic activity, which is concerning for metastatic disease.

Considering these factors, it would be important to further evaluate the patient for possible metastatic disease. Positron emission tomography (PET) scan is a useful imaging modality for detecting and staging malignancies. It can help identify any other possible sites of metastasis and guide further management decisions.

Therefore, the next step in this case would be a C: Positron emission tomography scan.

A: Perform fine-needle aspiration biopsy with cytology and cytogenetics. 

**Reasoning**: The patient has a history of lobular breast carcinoma and chromophobe kidney cell carcinoma, making the choroidal mass suspicious for metastatic disease. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy with cytology and cytogenetics can help confirm the diagnosis by analyzing the cells and their genetic characteristics. This will provide valuable information for further management and treatment planning.

C: Inflammatory breast cancer.

**Reasoning**:
The patient presents with a rapidly progressing rash and swelling on the left side of the chest wall, which started a few days after receiving the second dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Moderna). This suggests a possible vaccine-related reaction. However, the presence of a deep-infiltrated, pink, fallacious purple color papule on the left breast, inverted left nipple, and gynecomastia, along with lymphadenopathy on positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan, point towards a malignant process.

The punch biopsy of the skin shows a diffuse island of atypical cells in the dermis, which further supports the suspicion of malignancy. The immunohistochemical staining findings, positive for CK-7, GATA-3, and weak focal staining for PAX-8, along with negative staining for ER, PR, TTF-1, SATB-2, CDX-2, and NKX-3.1, indicate a pattern consistent with inflammatory breast cancer.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is inflammatory breast cancer (option C).

C) Familial lipomatosis

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation, physical examination findings, and imaging results, the most likely diagnosis is familial lipomatosis. 

1. The patient has an enlarging neck mass that has been present for more than 2 years, which is consistent with the slow-growing nature of lipomatosis.
2. The mass is compressible and has areas of fat deposition, which are characteristic features of lipomatosis.
3. The patient's history of a similar mass treated with liposuction 10 years prior suggests a predisposition to the development of adipose tissue masses.
4. The family history is negative for any malignant or benign head and neck diseases, which is consistent with familial lipomatosis being a genetic disorder.
5. The physical examination findings of lingual tonsil hypertrophy, narrow oropharynx, and hypopharynx, along with the imaging findings of diffuse symmetric fatty infiltration of the pharynx, larynx, trachea, and esophagus, further support the diagnosis of familial lipomatosis.
6. The surgical intervention aimed at removing the entire mass, including its capsule, and the subsequent postsurgical imaging showing significant resection of the fat prominence are consistent with treating familial lipomatosis.

Therefore, based on the presented information, the most likely diagnosis for the large bilateral compressible neck mass in the 55-year-old man is familial lipomatosis (C).

C) Porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation of a school-aged boy with hyperkeratotic papules with central white spicules and comedo-like plugs in a linear distribution on his face, trunk, and extremities since birth, along with accompanying alopecia of the scalp and eyebrows, the most likely diagnosis is Porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus (PEODDN). 

PEODDN is a rare genodermatosis characterized by hyperkeratotic papules with a linear distribution, often following the lines of Blaschko. The central white spicules and comedo-like plugs are distinguishing features seen in PEODDN. Alopecia of the scalp and eyebrows can also be associated with this condition. The lack of family history or consanguineous marriage suggests a sporadic form of the disorder.

Inflammatory linear verrucous epidermal nevus (ILVEN) typically presents with linear verrucous papules and plaques, but does not commonly exhibit the central white spicules and comedo-like plugs seen in this case.

Trichodysplasia spinulosa is a rare viral infection characterized by hypertrichosis, follicular papules, and spicules. Although it can present with spicules, the absence of viral infection in this case and the lack of other features such as follicular hypertrichosis make this diagnosis less likely.

Multiple minute digitate hyperkeratosis is a benign condition presenting with multiple small hyperkeratotic lesions, typically on the fingers or toes. This diagnosis does not fit the clinical presentation described in the case.

Reasoning:
Based on the clinical presentation and histopathological examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH).

LCH is a rare disorder characterized by the proliferation of abnormal Langerhans cells. It can involve multiple systems, including the skin, lymph nodes, bones, and liver. In this case, the patient presents with nonhealing ulcers in the groin and axillae, which gradually progressed from papules and plaques. These ulcers were associated with pain, pus discharge, and did not respond to multiple courses of antibiotics, antifungals, and steroids.

Furthermore, the patient also has a history of scalp involvement with scaling and greasiness, which is suggestive of seborrheic dermatitis. Additionally, the presence of mobile, firm, nonmatted, and nontender lymph nodes in cervical and inguinal regions, hepatomegaly, and bilateral parotid enlargement indicate multisystem involvement.

The histopathological examination reveals dense infiltration of the ulcer bed by atypical Langerhans cells. Immunohistochemistry shows diffuse positivity for CD1a in the lower epidermis and dermis, which is a characteristic feature of LCH.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation, histopathological findings, and immunohistochemistry results, the most likely diagnosis is Langerhans cell histiocytosis (C).

Reasoning: This patient is presenting with recurrent presyncope, bradycardia, and right bundle branch block (RBBB) on the ECG. The presence of RBBB along with symptoms of bradycardia suggests the possibility of 3rd degree atrioventricular block (AV block). Given the history of atrial fibrillation and the ECG findings of RBBB and left posterior fascicular block (LPFB), it is important to determine if these conduction abnormalities are causing the bradycardia symptoms.

Therefore, the next step would be to perform an ambulatory ECG monitoring (also known as Holter monitoring) to assess for the presence of complete heart block or other significant arrhythmias that may be causing the symptoms. This will provide continuous ECG monitoring over a period of time to capture any intermittent or transient conduction abnormalities that may not be evident on a single ECG.

**Reasoning**:

Based on the patient's presentation and findings, several possible diagnoses can be considered. 

1. Late-onset Pompe disease (glycogen-storage disease type 2): This is a metabolic disorder characterized by deficient activity of the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase, leading to the accumulation of glycogen in various tissues, including muscle. Symptoms typically include progressive muscle weakness, respiratory difficulties, and cardiomyopathy. However, the absence of respiratory symptoms and the presence of atrophic myofibers with a patchy granular appearance on muscle biopsy make this diagnosis less likely.

2. Myasthenia gravis: This is an autoimmune disorder characterized by muscle weakness and fatigability due to antibody-mediated destruction of the acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. Although the patient had some signs of muscle weakness, such as symmetric weakness of neck flexion, shoulder abduction, elbow flexion and extension, and hip flexion and extension bilaterally, the presence of atrophic myofibers on muscle biopsy and the lack of typical features of myasthenia gravis (e.g., ocular involvement, fluctuating weakness) make this diagnosis less likely.

3. Paraneoplastic myositis: This is a rare inflammatory disorder of the muscles that can occur as a paraneoplastic syndrome in the setting of an underlying malignancy. The patient's weight loss and the presence of a small immunoglobulin G (IgG) κ paraprotein make this a possibility. However, the absence of any evidence of an underlying malignancy on whole-body positron emission tomography scan and the lack of inflammatory infiltrates on muscle biopsy make this diagnosis less likely.

4. Sporadic late-onset nemaline rod myopathy: Nemaline rods are abnormal structures found within muscle cells and are associated with various genetic and sporadic muscle disorders. Patients typically present with progressive muscle weakness and wasting, and the presence of nemaline rods can be seen on muscle biopsy. Although the patient's muscle biopsy revealed atrophic myofibers with a patchy granular appearance (not typical of nemaline rods), the widespread small, brief, polyphasic units seen on electromyography (EMG) are consistent with a myopathic process, supporting the possibility of a myopathy such as sporadic late-onset nemaline rod myopathy.

In conclusion, based on the clinical presentation, muscle biopsy findings, and EMG findings, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is D: Sporadic late-onset nemaline rod myopathy.

Reasoning: Based on the information provided, the patient is a 50-year-old woman with hypertension and a significant weight gain, who reports loud snoring and infrequent abrupt awakenings with a sensation of breathlessness. These symptoms, along with her high blood pressure and obesity (BMI of 51.3), raise suspicion for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The home sleep apnea test results would be helpful in confirming the diagnosis of OSA.

However, it is important to note that the home sleep apnea test has limitations and may not accurately detect all cases of OSA. In this case, the patient does not have excessive daytime sleepiness, headaches, or significant desaturation, but her symptoms and hypertension suggest the need for a more definitive evaluation. Therefore, performing laboratory-based polysomnography (Option C) would be the most appropriate next step.

C) Add netarsudil eye drops every night at bedtime in the left eye.

**Reasoning**:
This patient with glaucoma has a history of severe primary open-angle glaucoma in both eyes, with elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in response to topical corticosteroids. On examination, the patient has diffuse facial edema and erythema, suggesting a possible adverse reaction to the corticosteroid eye drops. In addition, the patient has syncopal episodes, dysphagia, and sinus congestion, which could be indicative of systemic absorption of the corticosteroid. 

One potential treatment option in this case is to discontinue the fluorometholone eye drops, as corticosteroids can increase intraocular pressure (IOP). However, the patient is already on multiple IOP-lowering medications and has glaucoma progression in the left eye with worsening visual field defects. 

Adding netarsudil eye drops, a novel Rho kinase inhibitor, every night at bedtime in the left eye can help to further lower the IOP and slow the progression of glaucoma. Netarsudil has been shown to be effective in lowering IOP and is usually well-tolerated. It does not have the same side effects as corticosteroids and can be used as an adjuvant therapy in patients who require additional IOP lowering. 

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to add netarsudil eye drops every night at bedtime in the left eye.

D: Perform an emergency orbital exploration with lesion biopsy.

**Reasoning**:
Given the clinical presentation of acute unilateral proptosis, progressive diplopia, periorbital pain, and swelling, along with findings on imaging (intraconal mass on MRI and echolucent avascular lesion on ultrasonography), it is important to perform an emergency orbital exploration with lesion biopsy. This will provide both diagnostic information and potentially therapeutic intervention, allowing for the identification and removal of the lesion causing the proptosis and other associated symptoms. Admitting for a course of intravenous antibiotics would not be appropriate as there is no evidence of infection or indication for antibiotic treatment based on the history and imaging findings. Ordering a homovanillic acid and vanillylmandelic acid test would not be useful in this case, as these tests are used to evaluate for neuroendocrine tumors and would not provide relevant information for the patient's presenting symptoms. Starting high-dose steroids may have potential benefit for reducing inflammation and swelling, but given the progressive and significant nature of the patient's symptoms, it is more appropriate to proceed with an emergency orbital exploration and biopsy.

**Reasoning**:
The clinical presentation of a previously healthy 12-year-old boy with nasal obstruction, progressive dysphonia, recurrent deep neck abscesses, and bulky cervical lymphadenopathy suggests a systemic lymphoproliferative disorder. The presence of histiocytes with emperipolesis (engulfment of intact lymphocytes) in the biopsy samples is a characteristic finding of Rosai-Dorfman disease (sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy). Rosai-Dorfman disease typically presents with bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, and involvement of the upper respiratory tract is not uncommon. The disease is benign, self-limited, and tends to resolve over time with or without treatment. However, treatment is sometimes necessary for symptomatic relief or to manage complications, such as airway obstruction or other organ involvement.

Based on the clinical presentation of painful lesions on the tongue that have been present for at least 3 months, exacerbated by spicy foods, and a physical examination notable for bilateral raised leukoplakia on the tongue with a slightly hairy appearance, the most likely diagnosis is A: Oral hairy leukoplakia.

Oral hairy leukoplakia is a viral infection caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and commonly occurs in individuals who are immunocompromised, such as those with HIV/AIDS. The characteristic feature of oral hairy leukoplakia is the presence of white, corrugated or hairy-looking plaques on the lateral borders of the tongue. The lesions cannot be scraped off and are usually asymptomatic, but can cause pain or discomfort, especially with spicy foods.

Multifocal squamous cell carcinoma in situ is less likely in this case as the lesions are tender to touch, which is not characteristic of squamous cell carcinoma. Additionally, squamous cell carcinoma usually presents as a single lesion rather than bilateral lesions.

Secondary syphilis would typically present with a painless mucous patch, generalized lymphadenopathy, rash, and other constitutional symptoms. The lesions in this case are painful and there is no mention of other symptoms consistent with syphilis.

Herpetic infection could be considered, but oral herpes typically present with recurrent episodes of painful vesicles that eventually rupture to form shallow ulcers, which is not consistent with the presentation described in the case.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is oral hairy leukoplakia.

A)

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation, the patient has diffuse, short, and sparse hair that resembles lanugo. The scalp is smooth without inflammation or focal alopecic patches. There is no involvement of other areas such as eyebrows, eyelashes, nails, teeth, or body hair. The hair pull test is positive with anagen hair being predominantly extracted. Light microscopy of the scalp hair shafts reveals no structural abnormalities. Blood levels of ferritin, zinc, and hemoglobin are normal. A punch biopsy shows a mild lymphocytic perifollicular infiltrate and increased telogen hair with a decreased anagen-to-telogen ratio.

Short anagen syndrome is characterized by chronic, lifelong, sparse hair that does not grow beyond a certain length. It usually presents from infancy. Hair loss in short anagen syndrome is due to a shortened anagen (growth) phase of the hair follicles.

Loose anagen syndrome is characterized by easily pluckable hair that does not grow properly. It usually presents in childhood. Hair in loose anagen syndrome has an abnormal anchoring ability due to a defect in the inner root sheath.

Trichodental dysplasia is a rare genetic disorder characterized by sparse hair, short stature, and dental abnormalities.

Hypotrichosis simplex of the scalp is a rare genetic disorder characterized by sparse hair that does not grow beyond a certain length.

Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the most likely diagnosis is Short anagen syndrome.

**Reasoning**: Based on the clinical presentation, the patient has intensively pruritic annular papules on her extremities. The lesions are erythematous and measure up to 5 mm wide. There are also asymptomatic brown flat papules on her face. The palms, soles, and oral mucosa are not involved. The patient has a history of eczema and has been previously treated with topical steroid ointments and oral compound glycyrrhizin tablets with no improvement. Laboratory investigations, including routine blood tests and autoimmune markers, are within normal limits. A biopsy specimen was obtained for histopathologic examination.

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is A: Annular lichen planus. Lichen planus presents as pruritic, polygonal, flat-topped papules that can form annular or linear patterns. It commonly affects the extremities and can have associated mucosal involvement. The histopathologic examination of a biopsy specimen can confirm the diagnosis. Perforating granuloma annulare typically presents as flesh-colored to erythematous annular papules with central umbilication. Eruptive pruritic papular porokeratosis manifests as pruritic, small, reddish-brown papules or keratotic papules on the extremities. Atypical pityriasis rosea is characterized by a large, scaly, erythematous plaque with a central clearing.

Therefore, the correct answer is A: Annular lichen planus.

Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is Niemann-Pick disease type C (Choice C). 

The patient has a slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia, which is a characteristic feature of Niemann-Pick disease type C. Other findings that support this diagnosis include gaze-evoked horizontal nystagmus, ataxic dysarthria, absent stretch reflexes, and plantar fascia being mute. Additionally, the presence of chorea in both legs and ankle inversion with bilateral hammertoes are consistent with Niemann-Pick disease type C. 

On brain MRI, diffuse cerebellar atrophy and T2 hyperintensities in bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles, cerebellar white matter, pons, and bilateral thalamus are typical findings seen in Niemann-Pick disease type C.

Friedreich ataxia (Choice A) is characterized by progressive gait ataxia with lower limb weakness. It is usually associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, absent lower limb reflexes, and impaired vibration sense.

Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (Choice B) is characterized by intention tremor, ataxia, and parkinsonism. It is caused by a premutation in the FMR1 gene.

Mitochondrial ataxia (Choice D) can present with ataxia as a prominent feature, but it is usually accompanied by other neurologic findings such as ophthalmoparesis, ptosis, hearing loss, and peripheral neuropathy.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and exclusion of other possibilities, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is Niemann-Pick disease type C.

B) Obtain Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM and IgG levels.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation, the patient has persistent fever, cough, vesiculobullous skin lesions, and mucositis. These findings are suggestive of an infectious etiology. Among the answer choices provided, the most appropriate next step would be to obtain Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM and IgG levels.

Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common cause of atypical pneumonia in children. It can also cause extrapulmonary manifestations, including mucocutaneous involvement. This infection can lead to the formation of vesiculobullous lesions on the skin and mucous membranes. Therefore, testing for Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM and IgG levels would help confirm or rule out this infection as the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

Other answer choices are less likely based on the clinical presentation:
A) The pathergy test is used for diagnosing Behçet disease, which typically presents with recurrent oral and genital ulcers, uveitis, and skin lesions. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not fit with this diagnosis.
C) Performing an echocardiogram is not indicated based on the clinical presentation. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are more consistent with an infectious etiology, rather than a cardiac condition.
D) Testing for monkeypox virus is not indicated based on the clinical presentation. Although the patient has vesiculobullous skin lesions, monkeypox is a rare condition that typically occurs in specific geographic areas and has a characteristic clinical presentation (e.g., lymphadenopathy, systemic symptoms).

D: Delayed iatrogenic bilateral vocal fold paralysis.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation and history provided, the patient underwent anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgery (ACDF) for cervical spondylotic myelopathy. The symptoms of odynophagia, dysphagia, and pooling of secretions in the left pyriform indicate possible damage or compression of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN), which innervates the vocal folds and is involved in swallowing and phonation.

The subsequent development of shortness of breath, stridor, and severely limited vocal fold abduction suggest bilateral vocal fold paralysis. This can occur as a result of trauma or injury to the RLN during surgery, particularly in procedures involving the cervical spine.

Other potential causes, such as Arnold-Chiari malformation or spinal abscess, are less likely given the absence of corresponding symptoms, clinical findings, or abnormal imaging studies relating to these conditions.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is delayed iatrogenic bilateral vocal fold paralysis, resulting from damage to the RLN during the anterior cervical spine surgery.

It is important to consider this diagnosis in patients with respiratory distress following cervical spine surgery, as immediate intervention may be required to secure the airway.

C: Plaque brachytherapy.

**Reasoning:**
Based on the case presentation, the patient has a longstanding, stable pigmented iris lesion without any concerning symptoms or signs of malignancy. Given the patient's age and the stability of the lesion, observation would be a reasonable option. However, considering the presence of large pigment granules on the surface of the tumor and adjacent iris, as well as mammillations and significant thickness of the lesion (1.4mm height and 4.1mm basal diameter), there is a concern for potential malignancy (such as iris melanoma). 

Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (Option B) has limited utility in determining the malignancy of an iris lesion because of sampling error and potential risk for tumor dissemination.

Iridectomy for excision of the lesion (Option D) may be an appropriate option for benign tumors or lesions causing symptoms, but it carries the risk of tumor cell dissemination during surgery.

Plaque brachytherapy (Option C) is a well-established treatment option for small to moderate-sized iris melanomas. It involves the placement of a radioactive plaque (usually containing iodine-125) on the sclera overlying the tumor, allowing precise delivery of radiation therapy to the lesion. This treatment modality has been shown to provide local tumor control with low rates of vision-threatening complications.

Given the clinical presentation and characteristics of the lesion, plaque brachytherapy would be the most appropriate next step in management.

Based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is lymphomatoid granulomatosis.

- The patient has rapidly growing and itchy cutaneous nodules all over the body. This is consistent with lymphomatoid granulomatosis, which typically presents with multiple nodules.
- There are prominent lymphadenopathies on bilateral cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymph nodes. Lymphadenopathy is a common finding in lymphomatoid granulomatosis.
- Laboratory tests show an elevated CD4+/CD8+ lymphocyte ratio, atypical lymphocytes in the peripheral blood, and high loads of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA. These findings are suggestive of lymphomatoid granulomatosis, which is associated with EBV infection.
- The skin biopsy sample shows infiltration of atypical lymphocytes and histiocytes with proliferation of high endothelial venules. This is consistent with lymphomatoid granulomatosis.

Based on the clinical presentation of a chronically evolving rash on the dorsal aspect of the hand with subsequent spread to the forearm, along with the presence of large, erythematous plaques with purulent discharge and crusting, the most likely diagnosis is chromoblastomycosis. Chromoblastomycosis is a chronic fungal infection caused by dematiaceous (pigmented) fungi, most commonly Fonsecaea spp., Phialophora spp., and Cladophialophora spp. The infection typically occurs after traumatic inoculation and manifests as verrucous, hyperkeratotic plaques with eventual ulceration and crusting. Histopathological examination reveals pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis, and lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with neutrophils, plasma cells, and multinucleated giant cells. Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining can help identify the fungi in tissue samples. Transmission electron microscopy can also be used to confirm the presence of fungal elements.

Based on the patient's clinical presentation of intermittent chest pain and diaphoresis, along with elevated troponin T levels, there is high suspicion for acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient's risk factors, including a significant smoking history and elevated LDL cholesterol, further support this suspicion. The biphasic T waves seen on the ECG can also be indicative of ACS.
Performing coronary angiography is necessary to visualize the coronary arteries and determine if there is any significant narrowing or blockage that could be causing the patient's symptoms. This procedure will provide a definitive diagnosis and guide further management, such as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or medical management, depending on the findings. 

Discharging the patient home with outpatient cardiology follow-up would not be appropriate at this time, given the high suspicion for ACS and the potential for significant cardiac pathology. Reordering troponin T measurement in 3 hours may not be sufficient to confirm or exclude ACS, as the current troponin T level is already elevated. Dobutamine stress echocardiogram would also not be the first-line diagnostic choice, as it may not provide the necessary visualization of the coronary arteries to assess for significant blockages.

Reasoning:
Based on the information provided, the patient has treatment-refractory nodular scleritis, which is characterized by a painful uveal-episcleral lesion that does not respond to standard treatments such as oral prednisone and topical prednisolone. The patient also has a history of elevated intraocular pressure with steroid use. Given the history of Rosai-Dorfman-Destombes (RDD) disease and the lack of response to current treatments, it is important to consider alternative systemic therapy with an immunomodulatory agent.

B: Neoadjuvant cemiplimab immunotherapy (anti–PD-L1 antibody), globe sparing orbitotomy, and surgical excision of the mass.
**Reasoning**:
Based on the case presentation, the patient has a recurrent cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with orbital extension. The mass has invaded through the right sphenoid wing, involved the lacrimal gland, and abutted the lateral rectus. Given the extent of the disease involvement, it is important to consider a treatment approach that addresses both the local disease as well as the systemic spread of the cancer.

Option A, partial debulking of the temple mass followed by cetuximab treatment, may be a suitable choice in certain cases of SCC, but in this case, the tumor has already invaded the skull base and adjacent structures, which makes obtaining clear surgical margins challenging. Therefore, cetuximab alone would not be sufficient to treat the extent of disease.

Option C, palliative radiotherapy, may help with symptom management and local control of the tumor but would not address the systemic spread of the cancer. It is important to consider a treatment approach that combines local control measures with systemic therapy.

Option D, platinum-based chemotherapy, may be an option for metastatic or unresectable disease; however, in this case, there is a potential for achieving complete surgical resection of the tumor and thus a more aggressive approach should be considered.

Therefore, option B, neoadjuvant cemiplimab immunotherapy (anti-PD-L1 antibody), globe sparing orbitotomy, and surgical excision of the mass, would be the most appropriate choice. Neoadjuvant immunotherapy can help reduce tumor burden and improve surgical outcomes. Globe sparing orbitotomy, combined with surgical excision of the mass, allows for local control while preserving the orbital function as much as possible.

C: Perform pars plana vitrectomy and excisional biopsy of the membrane.

**Reasoning**:

In this case, the patient presents with decreased visual acuity and metamorphopsia in the right eye. Examination reveals a pigmented epiretinal membrane and an area of retinal hyperpigmentation, indicating the presence of choroidal neovascularization (CNV). 

Given the patient's history of cutaneous nodular melanoma and the presence of pigmented cells in the anterior vitreous, it is important to rule out the possibility of ocular melanoma metastasis. Therefore, performing a pars plana vitrectomy and excisional biopsy of the epiretinal membrane would be the appropriate next step to determine the nature of the pigmented membrane and ensure early diagnosis and management if ocular melanoma metastasis is present. 

Intravitreal anti-VEGF injections may be indicated for exudative age-related macular degeneration, but in this case, the presence of a pigmented epiretinal membrane and choroidal neovascularization suggest a different etiology.

Providing reassurance and close observation may not be appropriate in this case, as further investigation is needed to determine the nature of the pigmented membrane and rule out ocular melanoma metastasis.

Topical and systemic steroids are not indicated based on the provided information and would not address the underlying cause of the pigmented epiretinal membrane and choroidal neovascularization.

B: Immunotherapy-related gastritis

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical history and presenting symptoms, it is important to consider possible causes for the patient's subacute epigastric pain. The patient has a history of chronic liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as well as recent treatment with nivolumab, an immunotherapy drug. The absence of elevated liver function tests, normal AFP levels, and negative viral studies suggest that the subacute abdominal pain is not related to liver cancer progression or infectious causes.

The computed tomography (CT) scan showed diffuse thickening of the gastric body, which is consistent with gastritis. The esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) findings of diffuse inflammation and ulcerations in the gastric body and antrum further support the diagnosis of gastritis.

Considering the patient's recent treatment with nivolumab, the most likely diagnosis is immunotherapy-related gastritis. Immunotherapy can lead to immune-mediated adverse events, including gastritis and other gastrointestinal toxicities. Therefore, option B, Immunotherapy-related gastritis, is the most appropriate diagnosis for this patient.

Reasoning: 
Based on the clinical history and examination findings, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is A: Cholesteatoma. Cholesteatoma is a non-cancerous growth that typically occurs in the middle ear and is often associated with a history of chronic ear infections or prior middle ear surgery. The yellow-whitish calcareous lobular mass seen on otoscopy, along with the mixed hearing loss and the findings on CT imaging, support this diagnosis. Cholesteatoma can cause conductive hearing loss due to the mass affecting the movement of the ossicles in the middle ear. The mass being hard and painful during palpation is also consistent with cholesteatoma. Other options such as B: Osteoma, C: Tophaceous gout, and D: Tympanosclerosis are less likely based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings.

B: Foregut duplication cyst. 

**Reasoning**:
The clinical presentation in this case includes a 6-month-old girl with inspiratory stridor, dysphagia, and imaging findings of a low-density lesion abutting the trachea and hypopharynx with rightward displacement of the trachea and larynx. The presence of intact vocal fold motion bilaterally with glottic competence on laryngoscopy suggests extrinsic compression rather than an intrinsic laryngeal abnormality. In addition, the absence of supraglottic or glottic masses and the ultrasound and computed tomography findings of a cystic lesion are consistent with a foregut duplication cyst. Foregut duplication cysts can present as cystic masses in the neck and can cause respiratory symptoms and dysphagia due to compression of the trachea and esophagus.

B: Epidermoid cyst.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation and histopathologic findings, the most likely diagnosis is an epidermoid cyst. An epidermoid cyst is a benign cyst that arises from epidermal cells trapped deep within the dermis. It is often seen in young adults and can present as a mass or swelling in various areas of the body, including the postauricular area. The cyst is typically filled with keratinous material and lined by stratified squamous epithelium, as seen in the histopathologic examination. Epidermoid cysts are usually slow-growing and non-tender.

Pilomatricoma is a benign skin tumor that arises from hair matrix cells and typically presents as a firm, subcutaneous nodule. It is not consistent with the clinical presentation and histopathologic findings described in this case.

Type 1 first branchial cleft cyst is a rare congenital anomaly that typically presents as an infected mass or sinus tract along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. It is not consistent with the clinical presentation and imaging findings described in this case.

Hemangioma is a vascular malformation characterized by a proliferation of blood vessels. It typically appears as a red or blue, compressible mass and is unlikely to present as a nontender, blue, cystic mass, as described in this case.

B: Laryngeal sarcoidosis

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation and findings from the laryngoscopy and pathology results, the most likely diagnosis is laryngeal sarcoidosis.

1. The patient presented with difficulty phonating and singing, odynophonia (pain during phonation), globus sensation, and dysphagia to solids. These symptoms are consistent with laryngeal involvement.

2. The patient had previously been treated with steroids and amoxicillin for chronic laryngitis, but there was no improvement in symptoms, suggesting that the underlying cause may not be an infection or simple inflammation.

3. The laboratory workup showed elevated antinuclear antibodies and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which can be seen in autoimmune diseases, such as sarcoidosis.

4. The laryngoscopy demonstrated severely edematous epiglottis, posterior pharyngeal wall, aryepiglottic folds, and arytenoids. These findings are characteristic of laryngeal sarcoidosis.

5. The pathology results showed hyperplastic squamous mucosa with submucosal chronic inflammation and fibrosis, along with nonnecrotizing granulomas in the subepithelium. These granulomas are consistent with sarcoidosis.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation, laryngoscopy findings, and pathology results, the most likely diagnosis in this case is laryngeal sarcoidosis.

B: Acquired perforating dermatosis. 

**Reasoning**:
The patient's presentation of widespread pruritic papulonodular skin lesions on the extremities and trunk, along with the presence of dome-shaped nodules with excoriated centers, is consistent with acquired perforating dermatosis. The pruritus and the progression of lesions after scratching also suggest this diagnosis.

The histopathological examination and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) testing are important for confirming the diagnosis. In this case, the histopathological examination revealed hyperkeratosis, acanthosis with irregular elongation of the rete ridges, fibrotic dermis, and perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate. Direct immunofluorescence showed linear deposition of immunoglobulin G along the basement membrane zone, which is not typical of acquired perforating dermatosis, but it may be secondary to the scratching and inflammation caused by the lesions.

Prurigo nodularis is characterized by intensely itchy nodules, but it usually does not present with widespread lesions and does not typically have dome-shaped excoriated centers. Epidermolysis bullosa pruriginosa is a rare subtype of epidermolysis bullosa characterized by pruritus and lichenified nodules, but it usually presents with blistering and fragility of the skin, which is not described in this case. Pemphigoid nodularis is a variant of bullous pemphigoid that presents with nodules, but the direct immunofluorescence findings are not consistent with this diagnosis.

A: Myasthenia gravis

**Reasoning**:
Based on the given clinical case, the patient presents with left-eye ptosis and vertical diplopia, indicating muscle weakness or dysfunction of the eye muscles. The nonfatigable partial left-eyelid ptosis, impaired left eye supraduction, and nonreactive left pupil suggest a neurological cause.

Holmes Adie pupil is characterized by a dilated and poorly reactive pupil. This is not consistent with the patient's presentation as the left pupil is described as nonreactive.

A posterior communicating artery aneurysm would be expected to cause more pronounced symptoms, such as severe headache, and visual disturbances that are not limited to the extraocular muscles. The CT angiography, MRI, and lumbar puncture results do not support the presence of an aneurysm.

Neurovascular conflict of the oculomotor nerve typically presents with additional symptoms, such as headache, limb weakness, or numbness, which the patient does not report.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is Myasthenia gravis, a neuromuscular disorder characterized by weakness and fatigue of the voluntary muscles, including the eye muscles.

A)

**Reasoning**:
Based on the presentation of symptoms, including malaise, chills, night sweats, sore throat, and difficulty swallowing, along with the presence of erythematous swollen eyelids, dome-shaped umbilicated nodules on the eyelid margins, vesicular lesions on the caruncle, and conjunctival hyperemia, the most likely diagnosis is herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. This diagnosis is supported by the presence of skin lesions, which are characteristic of cutaneous manifestations of HSV infection. 

Isolating the patient and notifying public health authorities is crucial in preventing the spread of the infection, as HSV is highly contagious. It is important to take appropriate precautions to prevent transmission to others, as well as to implement public health measures to control the spread of the infection.

Administering imiquimod, a medication used to treat certain skin conditions, is not indicated in this case, as the primary concern is the management of the underlying HSV infection.

Performing lesion excision by unroofing and curettage is also not recommended in this case. Lesion excision is not typically necessary for the management of HSV infections, which are primarily treated with antiviral medications.

Administering oral acyclovir is the appropriate next step in the management of this patient. Oral antiviral medications, such as acyclovir, are the mainstay of treatment for HSV infections. They help to reduce the severity and duration of symptoms, as well as prevent complications and transmission of the virus.

C: Request genetic testing and monitor

**Reasoning**:
Based on the presented case, an 11-year-old boy with a white retinal lesion with calcification in the left eye, several factors can guide the next step in management.

1. Age: The age of the patient is important to consider as certain conditions may be more prevalent in certain age groups.

2. Lack of symptoms: The patient reported no present or past ocular symptoms, which suggests that the lesion might be asymptomatic or causing minimal visual disturbance.

3. Family history: The patient had healthy, nonconsanguineous parents, which might reduce the likelihood of certain genetic conditions.

4. Funduscopic findings: The lesion is described as a white, translucent solid lesion with calcification in the inferonasal quadrant, along with associated vitreous seeds. These findings are suggestive of a retinal tumor.

Given these factors, the most appropriate next step would be to request genetic testing and monitor the lesion. Genetic testing can help identify underlying genetic abnormalities that may be causing the retinal lesion. Monitoring the lesion would involve regular follow-up visits with ophthalmic evaluations to assess for any changes in size or progression of the lesion over time.

Ordering orbital magnetic resonance imaging (Option A) may provide additional information about the location and extent of the lesion, but it is not typically the first step in evaluation.

Biopsy of the lesion (Option B) may be considered if the lesion shows signs of growth or malignancy, or if the genetic testing is inconclusive. However, it carries the risk of complications, and therefore is not the initial approach.

While ruling out infectious diseases (Option D) is important in the evaluation of any intraocular lesion, the clinical presentation and findings in this case are not suggestive of an infectious etiology.

Therefore, based on the available information, the most appropriate next step would be to request genetic testing and monitor the lesion.

B: Pars plana vitrectomy with vitreous biopsy.

**Reasoning**: The patient initially presented with severe pain, redness, and dense vitreous haze with no view of the retina, which was consistent with endophthalmitis. She was treated with intravitreal antibiotics based on the culture results, and her visual acuity improved to 20/70. However, on examination 4 weeks later, she had persistent vitritis and numerous white retinal lesions spread throughout the fundus. These findings suggest a possible ongoing infection or inflammatory reaction.

Given the persistence of vitritis and the presence of white retinal lesions, performing a vitrectomy with vitreous biopsy would be the next appropriate step. This procedure would allow for a more thorough evaluation of the vitreous cavity and obtain a sample for culture and analysis to identify the underlying cause of the retinal lesions. Repeat intravitreal antibiotics or adding intravitreal antifungals without confirming the etiology may not be effective and could potentially lead to further complications. Observation alone may not be appropriate as the patient is still symptomatic and has evidence of ongoing inflammation. Therefore, performing a vitrectomy with vitreous biopsy would provide important diagnostic information and potential therapeutic options.

C: Biopsy of the conjunctival lesion including a fresh specimen for flow cytometry.

**Reasoning**:

Based on the presented case, the patient has an erythematous right lower eyelid lesion with a vermiform appearance, accompanied by pruritus and pain. This was followed by redness and swelling of the inner part of the right conjunctiva. The patient denies any vision changes, eye pain, eye discharge, or systemic symptoms. Additionally, the patient recently immigrated from a rural area and had exposure to farm animals.

Given the patient's symptoms, it is important to perform a biopsy of the conjunctival lesion to determine the underlying cause. Flow cytometry can help identify the presence of abnormal cells or markers that may indicate the presence of malignancy or other pathological conditions.

Options A, B, and D are not the most appropriate next steps in this case. Cryotherapy with interferon alfa-2b may be used for certain conjunctival lesions, but it is not the first-line management for all cases. Injection of subconjunctival lidocaine followed by surgical removal of the lesion is not necessary without a confirmed diagnosis or indication for surgery. Oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and topical corticosteroids may be considered for symptomatic relief, but they do not address the underlying etiology of the condition.

Therefore, the next appropriate step would be to perform a biopsy of the conjunctival lesion including a fresh specimen for flow cytometry to determine the cause of the patient's symptoms.

D) Solitary fibrous tumor.

**Reasoning**:

In this case, the patient presented with a slow-growing mass in her left cheek, which was nontender, smooth, and had no overlying cutaneous changes. The contrast-enhanced maxillofacial computed tomography scan showed a well-circumscribed lesion with a peripheral rim of hyperenhancing soft tissue and a central cystic/necrotic component.

The findings from ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration revealed rare epithelial cells with degenerative changes and inflammatory cells, suggesting an inflammatory process. The core biopsy demonstrated a spindle cell neoplasm of uncertain origin, with negative immunostaining for CK8/18, S100, SOX10, myosin, smooth muscle actin, and CD31. However, STAT6 staining was diffusely positive.

Based on these findings, the diagnosis is most likely a solitary fibrous tumor. Solitary fibrous tumors are rare mesenchymal neoplasms that typically occur in the pleura but can also occur in extrapleural sites, including the head and neck region. They often present as slow-growing, well-circumscribed masses and have characteristic histological features. Immunostaining for STAT6 is a useful marker for confirming the diagnosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is D) Solitary fibrous tumor.

Based on the clinical presentation of left hemifacial weakness and unilateral hearing loss since birth, along with a grade VI peripheral left facial paralysis, the most likely diagnosis is a facial nerve schwannoma. This is supported by the findings on cerebral MRI and temporal bone CT, which reveal a left internal auditory canal mass involving nerve VII and its distal branches. The imaging characteristics of the mass, including hypointensity on T2, isointensity on T1, and strong enhancement after gadolinium injection, are consistent with a schwannoma.

**Reasoning**: 

Based on the patient's history of immunoglobulin A monoclonal gammopathy and the presence of a non-healing facial abscess with purulent drainage, Coccidioidomycosis is the most likely diagnosis.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is characterized by rapidly progressing painful ulcers that may have underlying pustules, but it is not commonly associated with immunoglobulin A monoclonal gammopathy.

Lupus vulgaris is a form of cutaneous tuberculosis and typically presents as slowly progressive red-brown nodules or plaques. It is not associated with immunoglobulin A monoclonal gammopathy.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's granulomatosis) is a systemic necrotizing vasculitis that commonly involves the upper respiratory tract and kidneys.

B: Place a temporary pacemaker and start treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin and amiodarone.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the given case, the patient presents with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) following mitral valve surgery. The patient's heart rate is elevated at 178 beats/min, and the 12-lead ECG reveals a regular tachycardia with no recognizable P waves. The QRS complexes show two different morphologies with a regular trigeminal pattern. Adenosine administration reveals an atrial tachycardia with a 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) ratio.

In this case, SVT with aberrancy (RBBB) is present, and the patient is hemodynamically stable with a normal blood pressure. Since there are no signs of acute decompensation or instability, urgent DC shock (A) is not indicated. Additionally, an urgent electrophysiologic investigation (D) is not necessary at this time.

The most appropriate next step would be to place a temporary pacemaker to provide stable cardiac pacing and to start treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin to prevent thromboembolic complications and amiodarone for rate control in the acute setting.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: Place a temporary pacemaker and start treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin and amiodarone.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation, this patient has insidious onset of limited mobility of joints, particularly involving the interphalangeal and metacarpophalangeal joints of the hands and feet. The presence of the "prayer sign" and the "groove sign" indicates the involvement of the fascia and subcutaneous tissue. The absence of skin changes, such as erythema or sclerotic plaques, suggests a diagnosis other than systemic sclerosis. The normal findings on imaging and nerve conduction studies also argue against myotonic dystrophy. Deep morphea usually presents with sclerosis and induration of the skin, which is not observed in this patient. Eosinophilic fasciitis should be considered in this case due to the presence of eosinophilia, elevated ESR and CRP, and the characteristic EMG findings of spontaneous activities in muscles and myotonic discharges.

C) Restart daily oral itraconazole. 

**Reasoning**:
The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with recurrent fungal infections involving the skin, nails, and oral mucosa. The history of white oral plaques and thickened, yellowed toenails suggests an oral candidiasis and onychomycosis, respectively. The red plaques on the feet and lower legs are likely a manifestation of tinea pedis. The potassium hydroxide wet mount preparation of skin scrapings demonstrated fungal elements, and fungal culture grew Candida albicans.

Given the recurrent nature of the patient's symptoms and their resolution with previous treatment with oral itraconazole, the most appropriate next step would be to restart daily oral itraconazole. This antifungal medication has shown efficacy in treating Candida infections, including oral candidiasis and onychomycosis. Continuous treatment with itraconazole may help prevent recurrence of the fungal infections.

**Reasoning**:
The patient presents with atypical upper eyelid retraction, right lagophthalmos, incomplete blink, and a 2-mm relative right enophthalmos. These findings, along with her history of a functional pituitary adenoma, raise concerns for possible orbital disease. Imaging is necessary to evaluate the anatomy and potential etiology of these findings. Serum thyroid laboratory testing (A) may be considered if clinical suspicion for thyroid eye disease is high, but given the atypical presentation, imaging should be performed first. Upper eyelid gold weight implantation (B) is a possible treatment option for progressive upper eyelid retraction causing exposure keratopathy, but it should be considered only after identifying and addressing the underlying etiology, which requires imaging first. Systemic steroid and antiviral therapy (C) would be appropriate for suspected infectious or inflammatory etiologies, but there are no clear indications for this treatment based on the information provided. Therefore, magnetic resonance imaging of the orbit (D) is the next step in the evaluation.

C: Observation with close follow-up.

**Reasoning**:
- The patient presents with a pigmented angle lesion in the right eye, which is a concerning finding given his history of cutaneous melanoma.
- However, the patient denies any changes in vision, flashes, floaters, eye pain, or eye redness. This suggests that the lesion may be benign and not causing any symptoms or complications.
- The patient has undergone serial positron emission tomography/computed tomography scans that have not shown any evidence of metabolically active disease, indicating that the melanoma is currently under control.
- The presence of a well-demarcated pigmented brown lesion without extension into the angle on gonioscopy suggests that the lesion is likely confined to the cornea and not invading deeper structures.
- In this case, it would be prudent to start with observation and close follow-up of the lesion, monitoring for any changes or progression. If the lesion shows any concerning features or starts to cause symptoms, further intervention such as corneal biopsy or surgical excision may be considered. However, given the lack of symptoms and the absence of metastatic disease, immediate intervention may not be necessary at this time.

B) Interventional radiology embolization and debulking

**Reasoning**:
Based on the description of the case, the patient has a persistent vascular lesion involving the left orbit and face despite previous treatment attempts with propranolol, topical timolol, and oral prednisolone. The lesion has caused significant ophthalmologic findings including amblyopia, esotropia, and hypertropia. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) shows persistent orbital involvement with mass effect on the globe. 

Given the lack of response to previous treatments and the ongoing ocular symptoms, the next appropriate step would be to consider interventional radiology embolization and debulking procedures. These procedures have been performed before and showed positive findings for glucose transporter 1 on pathology, indicating that the lesion has characteristics of a vascular malformation.

Pulsed dye laser therapy (Option C) may be considered for superficial and smaller vascular lesions, but in this case of a persistent lesion with significant ophthalmologic involvement, more aggressive treatment options are required.

Repeated trial of oral prednisolone (Option A) has already been attempted, and while it did decrease the size of the lesion, it was poorly tolerated and discontinued. Therefore, repeating this treatment is not likely to be effective.

Oral sirolimus (Option D) is a newer treatment option for vascular anomalies, but its use in this case would require further consideration and evaluation by a specialist. It would not be the immediate next step in management.

A: Intravascular anaplastic large cell lymphoma

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation of asymptomatic erythematous-infiltrated patches and plaques on the scalp and face, gradual enlargement and coalescence into large plaques and nodules, occasional mild erosions, and the absence of systemic symptoms such as fever, fatigue, chills, night sweats, or weight loss, a lymphoproliferative disorder should be considered. 

The histopathological findings of sheets of medium to large mononuclear cells infiltrating the dermis, filling and expanding apparent dermal blood vessels, and exhibiting large, irregular, pleomorphic nuclei with balloon appearance are suggestive of an intravascular lymphoma.

The immunohistochemistry findings of tumor cells being positive for CD3 (a T-cell marker) and negative for CD20 (a B-cell marker), AE1/AE3 (an epithelial marker), CK20 (a marker for gastrointestinal and urothelial epithelia), chromogranin A (a marker for neuroendocrine tumors), and melan-A (a marker for melanoma) further support the diagnosis of Intravascular anaplastic large cell lymphoma.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this case is Intravascular anaplastic large cell lymphoma (Answer A).

**Reasoning**: Based on the clinical presentation and history, the patient has a several-month history of severe nasal congestion, along with diffuse cutaneous lesions and a previous diagnosis of hypopigmented cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL, mycosis fungoides type). The physical examination shows an inverted V deformity of the nasal septum, obstructed nasal passages, and synechiae formation. 

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), also known as Wegener's granulomatosis. GPA is a systemic vasculitis that commonly affects the upper respiratory tract, including the nasal passages. It is characterized by granulomatous inflammation and necrosis. The nasal septum deformity and obstructed nasal passages seen in this patient are consistent with this diagnosis.

D: Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis.

**Reasoning**:

Based on the clinical presentation and findings on examination, the most likely diagnosis is recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP). RRP is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV) and commonly presents as exophytic lesions in the larynx. 

In this case, the patient presented with symptoms of increased postnasal drip, pharyngitis, odynophagia, cervicalgia, cervical lymphadenopathy, and right-sided otalgia. These symptoms are consistent with laryngeal involvement. On examination, a lesion was found on the laryngeal surface of the right epiglottis that extended to the right aryepiglottic fold but did not involve the true vocal cords. The biopsy showed inflamed squamous mucosa with ulceration, granulation tissue, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, and atypia.

Other options such as squamous cell carcinoma, coccidioidomycosis, and tuberculosis are less likely based on the clinical presentation and findings. Squamous cell carcinoma is more commonly associated with risk factors such as smoking and alcohol use. Coccidioidomycosis typically presents with respiratory symptoms and is more common in specific geographical areas. Tuberculosis typically presents with systemic symptoms such as fever, cough, and weight loss.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) caused by HPV.

C: Squamous cell cancer. 

**Reasoning**: 
The patient presented with progressive hoarseness and dyspnea, which are concerning for a laryngeal obstruction. The physical examination revealed stridulous breathing and severe laryngeal mucosal edema. The videostroboscopy showed irregularity and immobility of the true vocal folds, as well as absence of mucosal wave. These findings are consistent with a laryngeal pathology. 

The CT scan of the neck ruled out a neoplasm or cervical lymphadenopathy. However, the direct laryngoscopy with biopsy revealed edematous, irregular, and friable laryngeal mucosa with significant airway narrowing. These findings suggest an underlying malignant process.

Based on the clinical presentation and biopsy findings, the most likely diagnosis in this case is squamous cell cancer.

C: Farber disease (disseminated lipogranuloma)

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the most likely diagnosis is Farber disease (disseminated lipogranuloma).

- The patient presented with multiple skin-colored subcutaneous nodules that developed 40 days after birth. These nodules were tough to hard and ranged in size from 0.5 to 5 cm in diameter. This is consistent with the subcutaneous nodules seen in Farber disease.
- The nodules started on the left foot and subsequently progressed to involve the face, trunk, and extremities. This pattern of progression is characteristic of Farber disease.
- The patient also had distal interphalangeal joint deformity of both hands, which is commonly seen in Farber disease.
- Additionally, the presence of symmetrical beaded subcutaneous nodules in the bilateral auricles further supports the diagnosis of Farber disease.
- The physical examination revealed other findings such as horizontal nystagmus, voice hoarseness, and delayed motor development, which can all be seen in Farber disease.
- The histopathological images showed a granulomatous pattern, numerous foamy cells, collagen degeneration, and mucin deposition, which are consistent with the pathology seen in Farber disease.

Other potential differential diagnoses can be ruled out based on the clinical presentation, such as multicentric reticulohistiocytosis, juvenile hyaline fibromatosis, and rheumatoid nodules. However, these conditions do not encompass all the features seen in this case.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Farber disease (disseminated lipogranuloma) (Answer: C).

C: Keloidal scleroderma

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation of firm, red-brown plaques on the proximal upper extremities and anterior trunk without appreciable skin tightening in the affected areas, the most likely diagnosis is keloidal scleroderma.

Sarcoidosis typically presents with noncaseating granulomas and can have various cutaneous manifestations, but it usually does not present as firm plaques.

Lobomycosis is a chronic fungal infection that typically presents as subcutaneous nodules or plaques in tropical regions. It is not associated with systemic sclerosis.

Fibroblastic rheumatism is a rare disorder characterized by symmetric indurated plaques, usually on the extremities, associated with arthritis and Raynaud phenomenon. The plaques in fibroblastic rheumatism differ from the firm, red-brown plaques described in this patient.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis based on the clinical presentation is keloidal scleroderma.

A: Giant cell arteritis

**Reasoning:**
The patient is an older woman presenting with horizontal binocular diplopia (double vision) and right-sided ptosis (drooping eyelid). These symptoms, along with the new headache that is progressive over 3 days, are concerning for a neurologic or vascular cause. The presence of difficulty opening her jaw, pain when chewing, and weight loss further suggest a systemic inflammatory process. 

Given the patient’s age and the presence of headache, diplopia, and ptosis, the most likely diagnosis is giant cell arteritis (GCA), which is a form of vasculitis that affects medium and large arteries. Diplopia and ptosis in GCA are typically due to inflammation and ischemia of the extraocular muscles and the cranial nerves that innervate them, resulting in ophthalmoplegia. GCA commonly affects older individuals and may present with constitutional symptoms such as headache, weight loss, and jaw claudication.

The presence of normal visual acuity and pupils that are equal, round, and reactive helps to differentiate this from other causes of diplopia and ptosis, such as myasthenia gravis or a cranial nerve palsy. The limitation of elevation and abduction bilaterally on extraocular motility suggests a more global process affecting the extraocular muscles, which is characteristic of GCA.

The elevated C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate further support the diagnosis of GCA, as these are common laboratory findings in this condition. Although not mentioned in the case, a temporal artery biopsy would be the definitive test to confirm the diagnosis of GCA.

Anti-transfer RNA synthetase myositis and Immunoglobulin G4-related disease do not present with characteristic ophthalmoplegia and ptosis. Myasthenia gravis commonly presents with varying degrees of ptosis and diplopia that worsen with fatiguability, which is not observed in this patient.

C: Perform an electrooculogram and molecular genetic testing.

**Reasoning**:
The patient is an 88-year-old woman with persistent subretinal fluid (SRF) and enlarging pigment epithelial detachments (PEDs) in each eye following multiple injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) for presumed exudative age-related macular degeneration. The presence of yellow subretinal deposits and boat-shaped hyperautofluorescence suggests the presence of vitelliform material.

Given the presentation and the clinical suspicion of central serous chorioretinopathy, it is important to consider other possible differential diagnoses. The presence of bilateral refractory neurosensory retinal and pigment epithelial detachments raises concern for other underlying conditions, such as Best vitelliform macular dystrophy.

To further investigate and confirm the diagnosis, an electrooculogram (EOG) can be performed to assess the function of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and molecular genetic testing can help identify any specific mutations associated with Best vitelliform macular dystrophy.

Continuing intravitreal anti-VEGF injections (Option A) may not be effective in this case as the patient has shown persistent subretinal fluid and enlarging PEDs despite previous treatments. Starting photodynamic therapy (Option B) may not be appropriate without further investigation and confirmation of the underlying diagnosis. Obtaining serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation test (Option D) is not indicated based on the information provided in the case.

Therefore, performing an electrooculogram and molecular genetic testing (Option C) is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient.

B: Genetic testing

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation, including progressive vision loss, bilateral symmetric vision loss, nyctalopia, poor mentation, and inability to recall simple things, along with the ophthalmological findings of attenuated retinal vasculature, optic disc pallor, and central retinal atrophy, a genetic cause should be considered.

Considering the patient's history of neonatal seizures and the family history of unilateral vision loss in the paternal grandmother, a genetic cause is highly likely. Genetic testing would be the appropriate next step to identify any potential genetic mutations or syndromes that may be contributing to the patient's condition.

Electroretinogram (ERG) may be helpful in assessing retinal function, but it would not provide a definitive diagnosis or identify the underlying cause of the patient's condition. While muscle biopsy may be considered in certain cases of progressive vision loss, there are no specific indications in this case that would warrant a muscle biopsy.

Observation alone would not provide any further information or lead to a definitive diagnosis.

She does not have any salivary stones or masses, ruling out Sialolithiasis (C). The patient’s symptoms do not fit the criteria for Sjogren syndrome (B) as she does not have associated dryness of the eyes or mouth. Mikulicz syndrome (D) typically involves symmetrical swelling of the lacrimal and salivary glands, which does not correlate with the patient's presentation. The histologic examination of the surgical specimen reveals periductal inflammatory infiltrate with eosinophils, supporting the diagnosis of eosinophilic sialodochitis (A).

**Reasoning**:
- The presentation of a large, cystic neck mass that was present since birth suggests a congenital lesion.
- The location of the mass in the left submandibular region, with medial extension into the tongue musculature, is consistent with a lymphatic malformation.
- The imaging findings of a low attenuation, nonenhancing, cystic-appearing mass with thin walls and a single thin septation, as seen on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are also consistent with a lymphatic malformation.
- The milky white and mucinous cystic contents, as well as the presence of mature and anucleate squamous cells on cytology, are further suggestive of a lymphatic malformation.
- Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a macrocystic lymphatic malformation.

Reasoning: The patient presented with a gradually enlarging, ill-defined erythematous-plaque on the proximal portion of his left calf. Despite treatment with topical corticosteroids and antifungals, there was no improvement. The skin biopsy revealed a band-like vascular proliferation in the upper dermis with round vascular channels lined by a single layer of endothelial cells without atypia. CD34 immunostaining confirmed the presence of endothelial cells. 

The clinical and histopathological findings are consistent with the diagnosis of **C: Microvenular hemangioma**. This is a benign vascular tumor characterized by small, round, well-demarcated endothelial-lined vessels in the upper dermis. It typically presents as an erythematous-violaceous plaque and is often refractory to treatment with corticosteroids and antifungals.

B: Electrophysiology study.

**Reasoning**:
The patient's presentation of syncope with shaking and muscle jerks, along with symptoms of nausea, flushing, chest tightness, and a rapid heart rate, is concerning for a cardiac arrhythmia, specifically a ventricular arrhythmia. Given the patient's reported family history of sudden cardiac death, it further raises suspicion for an underlying cardiac electrical disorder. 

An electrophysiology study (EPS) is the next appropriate step in the management of this patient. An EPS involves inserting catheters into the heart to study the electrical conduction system and provoke any abnormal rhythms. This procedure can help identify the underlying cause of the patient's syncope and determine the need for further interventions, such as ablation or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) placement. 

A 30-day ambulatory event monitor may be considered if there is a lower level of suspicion for an arrhythmia, but given the patient's symptoms and family history, an EPS is more appropriate at this time. Ventricular ablation or ICD placement may be considered based on the findings of the EPS.

The next step in the management of this condition is to start acetazolamide, a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, which has been shown to reduce intracranial pressure. Acetazolamide is the standard initial treatment for pseudotumor cerebri and is recommended in guidelines. 

Therefore, the correct answer is D: Start acetazolamide.

A) Start intravenous corticosteroids for presumed serology-negative thyroid eye disease.

**Reasoning**:
The patient presented with acute-onset severe bilateral periorbital swelling, chemosis, and ophthalmoplegia, along with occasional flushing and palpitations. The findings on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed bilateral and symmetric tendon-sparing extraocular muscle enlargement with nodular heterogeneous enhancement. These findings are consistent with thyroid eye disease.

Although the patient's thyroid function tests were within normal limits, serology-negative thyroid eye disease can still occur. Given the clinical presentation and imaging findings, initiating treatment with intravenous corticosteroids is reasonable. Steroids are the mainstay of treatment for thyroid eye disease as they help reduce inflammation and minimize progression of the disease.

Therefore, the next step would be to start intravenous corticosteroids for presumed serology-negative thyroid eye disease (Option A).

D) Perform pars plana vitrectomy with removal of intraocular lens and capsular bag plus intravitreal antibiotics.

**Reasoning**:
The patient presents with unexplained subjective decrease in vision, elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) that is insufficiently controlled and a milky substance in the retrolental space, indicating the presence of a cataract-related complication called posterior capsular opacification (PCO). PCO occurs when the cells left behind after cataract surgery proliferate and migrate across the posterior capsule, causing visual deterioration.

Treatment with pilocarpine eye drops (A) is not indicated in this case as it is primarily used for the management of angle-closure glaucoma, which is not mentioned in the patient's history.

Scheduling for glaucoma surgery (B) may be considered as the patient has insufficiently controlled IOP. However, the presence of a milky substance in the retrolental space indicates the need for further evaluation and treatment of the cataract-related complication rather than focusing solely on glaucoma surgery.

Performing YAG capsulotomy (C) is a possible treatment option for PCO, but it is not sufficient in this case because the milky substance in the retrolental space suggests the presence of significant PCO with capsular bag distension. A more invasive procedure is necessary for complete removal of the affected structures.

Performing pars plana vitrectomy with removal of the intraocular lens (IOL) and capsular bag, along with intravitreal antibiotics (D), is the appropriate next step for this patient. It allows for complete removal of the affected structures, including the milky substance in the retrolental space, and provides better control of the IOP. Intravitreal antibiotics are added to prevent potential infection after the surgical procedure.

Laboratory results showed elevated levels of interleukin (IL) 10, IL-6, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Imaging studies revealed extensive lymphadenopathy and inflammation. The biopsy showed regression of lymphoid follicles, onion-skinning of mantle zone lymphocytes, hypervascularity, and atypical plasma cells.

Reasoning: Based on the history and physical examination findings, the patient presents with an asymptomatic verrucous plaque on the right temple. The lesion has been gradually developing over a period of 8 months, without associated symptoms such as fevers, weight loss, or night sweats. Laboratory tests show no abnormalities. The histopathologic analysis reveals small round blue cells with alternating areas of dense and loose cellularity, and the tumor cells are positive for MyoD1.

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is D: Primary cutaneous embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma. This is a rare soft tissue tumor that typically presents as a firm, painless mass in the head and neck region, and can have a verrucous appearance. The histopathologic features are consistent with rhabdomyosarcoma, and the positive staining for MyoD1 supports the diagnosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is D: Primary cutaneous embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma.

**Reasoning**: Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the most likely diagnosis is Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive mucocutaneous ulcers. The patient is immunocompromised due to poorly controlled HIV with a low CD4 count, making him susceptible to opportunistic infections. The presence of painful oral and perianal ulcers, along with pancytopenia and septic shock, suggests a systemic viral etiology. The biopsy of the perianal ulcer showing a mixed infiltrate of histiocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and eosinophils, along with scattered positivity for Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNA staining, further supports this diagnosis. Chronic ulcerative herpes simplex virus infection typically presents with grouped vesicles that progress to painful ulcers and is unlikely in this case. Crohn disease-associated pyostomatitis vegetans would present with oral mucosal ulcerations, but it typically occurs in the setting of Crohn disease and not in an immunocompromised individual. Ulcers secondary to fungal infections (such as candidiasis) would usually improve with treatment using oral fluconazole, which did not occur in this case.

C) Pituitary apoplexy.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis in this case is pituitary apoplexy. Pituitary apoplexy refers to the sudden bleeding or infarction of a pituitary tumor, often resulting in rapid-onset symptoms such as ophthalmoplegia, headache, and visual changes.

In this case, the patient had a known enhancing central skull base lesion in the sella turcica, which was initially felt to be a pituitary macroadenoma. The baseline examination before the cystectomy showed visual acuity of 20/20 with intact extraocular movements, although a mild bitemporal hemianopia was seen on automated visual fields. After the cystectomy, the patient developed immediate ophthalmoplegia, headache, facial numbness, and inability to open both eyes or move them in any direction.

The subsequent MRI showed a large sellar/parasellar lobulated mass with loss of enhancement and extension into the cavernous sinus bilaterally. These findings are consistent with pituitary apoplexy, as there is hemorrhage or infarction within the pituitary tumor causing compression of nearby structures including the optic chiasm and involvement of the cavernous sinus.

The other answer choices can be ruled out based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings. Orbital compartment syndrome typically presents with proptosis, decreased visual acuity, and elevated intraocular pressure, none of which were described in this case. Ocular motor apraxia is a congenital disorder characterized by the inability to voluntarily direct gaze. Cavernous sinus thrombosis would typically present with unilateral ophthalmoplegia and signs of cavernous sinus involvement, such as periorbital edema, chemosis, and proptosis. None of these findings were mentioned in this case.

**Reasoning**: Given the patient's history of intravenous heroin use and chronic inactive HBV infection, the sudden onset of painless jaundice and malaise suggests a possible new acute viral hepatitis infection. The normal liver enzyme values and absence of cirrhosis indicate that this is unlikely to be a flare of chronic HBV infection. 

To determine the cause of the patient's acute hepatitis, testing for other viral infections should be considered. The most appropriate next step would be to order testing for hepatitis E virus IgM antibody (Option B). Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a common cause of acute viral hepatitis worldwide and is associated with a self-limited course. Given that the patient has not traveled outside the US and has not reported consuming raw meat, testing for other potential causes of acute viral hepatitis, such as HEV, would be appropriate.

Testing for anti-smooth muscle antibody (Option C) is typically used to diagnose autoimmune hepatitis, but the presentation of painless jaundice and the absence of other clinical features suggestive of autoimmune disease make this less likely.

HIV infection can cause liver dysfunction; however, the absence of risk factors, travel, and exposure history make HIV testing (Option A) a lower priority at this stage. 

Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is a defective RNA virus that can only infect individuals with concomitant HBV infection. Given the patient's chronic inactive HBV infection, testing for HDV IgM and IgG antibodies, and if positive, for HDV RNA (Option D) could be considered in the future if the diagnosis remains unclear or the patient's condition fails to improve. However, at this stage, the acute onset of painless jaundice in the setting of recent intravenous drug use raises concern for acute viral hepatitis, making testing for HDV a lower priority.

**Answer**: B: Order testing for hepatitis E virus IgM antibody.

Reasoning: 

Based on the clinical presentation of recurrent eye and ear pain, along with systemic symptoms such as cough and weight loss, as well as laboratory findings of elevated ESR and C-reactive protein, the most likely diagnosis is temporal arteritis, also known as giant cell arteritis (GCA). GCA is a vasculitis that primarily affects medium-sized and large-sized arteries, especially those in the head and neck. It commonly presents in patients over the age of 50 and is associated with systemic symptoms such as fever, malaise, headache, and weight loss. The involvement of the eye (scleral erythema) and ear (swollen and erythematous cartilaginous portion) in this patient's case is consistent with GCA. GCA is a medical emergency, as it can lead to irreversible visual loss if not promptly diagnosed and treated. Therefore, prompt initiation of high-dose systemic corticosteroids is essential. Performing chest radiography and pulmonary function testing (PFT) is not indicated based on the patient's presentation and would not provide further information regarding the diagnosis of GCA. Biopsy of the left ear may potentially be helpful if there were doubts about the diagnosis or if clinical improvement did not occur with corticosteroid therapy; however, it is not the next step in management. Prescribing ibuprofen alone is inadequate for the management of GCA and would not address the severity of the disease.

D) Obtain orbital imaging with intravenous contrast.

**Reasoning**:
The patient's history of progressively worsening unilateral ptosis, especially at night and with fatigue, along with the absence of pain, muscle weakness, and other neurologic deficits, raises suspicion for a structural or compressive cause rather than a neuromuscular or neurologic etiology. The normal eye examination findings, including intact levator function, normal extraocular movements, and absence of diplopia, suggest that the ptosis is not due to a primary ocular muscle or nerve problem. Additionally, the negative serological testing results for antiacetylcholine receptor antibodies make myasthenia gravis less likely. 

Given the above findings, the next appropriate step would be to obtain orbital imaging with intravenous contrast to evaluate for any orbital or periorbital mass or abnormality that may be causing the ptosis. The imaging can provide information about the size, location, and characteristics of any potential mass or structural abnormality in the area, which may guide further management decisions.

A) Check thyrotropin and thyroid receptor autoantibody levels and order orbital imaging.

**Reasoning**:
This patient presented with sudden-onset headache, nausea, and binocular vertical diplopia. The fact that she has untreated hyperprolactinemia manifested by galactorrhea and oligomenorrhea is also important to note, as it could be related to her symptoms. The presence of vertical diplopia, worse in left gaze and right head tilt, suggests an ocular motility dysfunction.

The differential diagnosis for binocular vertical diplopia includes several conditions, such as thyroid eye disease (TED), myasthenia gravis, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, superior oblique palsy, and skew deviation. However, TED is the most likely diagnosis in this case, considering the patient's untreated hyperprolactinemia and the presence of infraduction limitation and hypertropia on examination. TED is an autoimmune condition that causes inflammation and enlargement of the extraocular muscles, leading to eye movement abnormalities.

Therefore, it is important to check the thyrotropin and thyroid receptor autoantibody levels to assess the patient's thyroid function and evaluate for possible underlying TED. Orbital imaging can also help confirm the diagnosis by demonstrating signs of extraocular muscle enlargement and inflammation.

Ordering acetylcholine receptor antibody level titers would be appropriate if there is suspicion of myasthenia gravis as a cause of the patient's symptoms. However, the presence of thyroid-related manifestations and the specific findings on examination make TED a more likely diagnosis.

Urgent computed tomography scan and computed tomography angiography of the brain are not indicated in this case as the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a specific ocular motility dysfunction rather than a brain pathology.

Performing an urgent lumbar puncture does not appear necessary based on the patient's presentation and examination findings. There is no indication of increased intracranial pressure or meningeal signs that would warrant an urgent lumbar puncture.

C: Order anterior segment optical coherence tomography.

**Reasoning**:
Before considering surgical intervention such as intraocular lens (IOL) suture fixation or exchange, it is important to obtain further information about the status of the intraocular structures. In this case, the patient had a history of remote cataract surgery with subsequent IOL placement. The current presentation of a subluxed IOL along with vitreous prolapse into the anterior chamber suggests significant disruption of the normal anatomical structures in the right eye. 

Ordering anterior segment optical coherence tomography (OCT) would provide detailed cross-sectional images of the anterior segment structures, including the position of the subluxed IOL, the extent of vitreous prolapse, and any other abnormalities. This can help guide clinical decision-making regarding the need for surgical intervention and determine the best approach for managing the patient's vision loss.

Performing a biopsy of the ocular surface lesion, as suggested in option D, may be necessary if there are concerns about malignancy or infection. However, in this case, the primary concern is the subluxed IOL and its impact on vision, rather than the ocular surface lesion. Therefore, ordering anterior segment OCT is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient.

D) Perform therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty of the right eye.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the patient has bilateral corneal ulcers with significant stromal thinning in the right eye. The corneal ulcers are likely caused by prolonged eye rubbing and the patient's restricted diet lacking in essential nutrients.

Option A: Performing allergy testing and initiating topical steroids would not be the best course of action as the patient's symptoms and findings are not consistent with an allergic reaction.

Option B: Checking serum vitamin A levels may be important in the management of corneal ulcers, but it is not the first step in this case. The immediate concern is the risk of corneal perforation in the right eye, requiring prompt intervention.

Option C: Obtaining corneal herpes simplex viral cultures would be reasonable if there was suspicion of herpes simplex virus infection. However, there are no clinical findings suggestive of herpetic keratitis, and the patient's symptoms are more consistent with bilateral corneal ulcers caused by mechanical trauma.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to perform therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty of the right eye to prevent corneal perforation and preserve visual function.

D: Meniere disease

**Reasoning**:

The patient presented with sudden onset and unremitting vertigo, right aural fullness, and subjective right-sided hearing loss. The positive Dix-Hallpike test with rotary nystagmus suggests canalithiasis, a classic feature of Meniere disease. Additionally, the audiogram reveals a low- to mid-frequency moderate conductive hearing loss on the right side, which is characteristic of Meniere disease.

B: Parathyroid cyst

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is a parathyroid cyst. 

1. Unilateral neck mass: The patient presented with a unilateral neck mass on the right side, which is consistent with the location of a parathyroid gland. 

2. Painless and progressively growing: The patient reported that the mass has been slowly progressive and painless, which is typical for a parathyroid cyst. 

3. Moving with swallowing: The mass was found to move with swallowing, which is a characteristic feature of a parathyroid cyst. 

4. Imaging findings: The neck ultrasound revealed a well-circumscribed anechoic lesion in the right thyroid lobe, consistent with a cystic lesion. The neck CT scan showed an intrathyroidal lesion causing tracheal compression, which is suggestive of a parathyroid cyst. 

5. Normal thyroid function and calcium levels: The patient had normal thyroid stimulating hormone and calcium levels, ruling out thyroid disease. 

6. Positive staining for PTH: The tissue inside the lesion stained positive for parathyroid hormone (PTH), confirming the presence of a parathyroid cyst. 

Based on these findings, the diagnosis is most likely a parathyroid cyst (B).

Reasoning: The patient presents with right preauricular and right upper neck swelling, which is concerning for a parotid gland mass. The absence of erythema or tenderness suggests a non-inflammatory etiology. The intact cranial nerves, specifically the right facial nerve and its branches, suggest that the mass is not compressing or infiltrating these structures. The absence of oral mucosal lesions suggests that the mass does not originate from the oral cavity and extend into the parotid gland. The slight hematuria on urinalysis is likely unrelated. The CT images show an ill-defined infiltrative mass in the deep lobe of the right parotid gland, which is concerning for malignancy. The follow-up CT performed 6 weeks later suggests an interval increase in the size of the mass, further supporting the possibility of malignancy.

C) Lipodystrophia centrifugalis abdominalis infantilis

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation and findings described in the case, Lipodystrophia Centrifugalis Abdominalis Infantilis (LCAI) is the most likely diagnosis. LCAI is a rare disorder characterized by progressive atrophy of subcutaneous fat, typically starting in the abdominal region and spreading centrifugally to involve other areas of the body. In this case, the lesion started in the neck and progressed to the nape and submandibular regions. The central atrophy with an erythematous border and visible underlying blood vessels corresponds to the characteristic findings seen in LCAI.

Other options can be ruled out based on the clinical presentation and findings. Morphea typically presents as localized patches of sclerotic skin, which is not consistent with the findings in this case. Lupus panniculitis is characterized by inflammatory lesions involving the subcutaneous fat, which is not observed in this case. Subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn typically presents shortly after birth and is typically associated with a history of birth trauma, which was denied by the parents in this case.

**Reasoning**: The patient's presentation of painful erythematous plaques on the trunk, along with the presence of a solid mass in the lower abdomen and other systemic symptoms such as weight loss, vaginal bleeding, and abdominal discomfort, are concerning for metastatic carcinoma. The histopathological examination of the skin biopsy also showed large atypical cells with lymphovascular invasion, further supporting the diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma. Cutaneous endometriosis would be unlikely in this case as the patient does not have a history of endometriosis and the skin lesions are not consistent with typical endometriosis lesions. Interstitial granulomatous dermatitis and Wolf isotopic response are also less likely given the clinical presentation and histopathological findings. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is metastatic carcinoma.

C: Autosomal recessive parkinsonism

**Reasoning**:

Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the most likely diagnosis is autosomal recessive parkinsonism. 

1. The patient presents with progressive parkinsonism with poor response to levodopa, which is consistent with parkinsonism seen in autosomal recessive forms. 
2. The patient has a history of unexplained sensory hearing loss, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis, which may suggest an underlying genetic disorder. 
3. The patient had bilateral cataract surgery at a young age, which may be associated with mitochondrial dysfunction seen in mitochondrial diseases. However, the absence of lactic acidosis or strokelike episodes makes mitochondrial encephalopathy less likely. 
4. The patient has features of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, restless legs syndrome (RLS), visual daytime hallucinations, and rapid cognitive decline, which are commonly seen in parkinsonism. 
5. Neurological examination shows hypomimia, symmetrical bradykinesia, and rigidity without tremors, which are consistent with parkinsonism. 
6. The brain imaging findings of mild frontal and parietal atrophy and hypometabolism in the left cerebral hemisphere are non-specific but can be seen in parkinsonism. 
7. The absence of paraneoplastic antibodies and negative family history of movement or developmental disorders make paraneoplastic syndrome less likely. 

Therefore, based on the clinical features and findings, the most likely diagnosis is autosomal recessive parkinsonism.

D) Prescribe oral dapsone.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the patient is most likely presenting with pyoderma gangrenosum, which is a neutrophilic dermatosis typically associated with underlying systemic diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, hematological malignancies, or rheumatological conditions. The characteristic features include tender, necrotic ulcerated plaques with surrounding erythematous indurated base. The absence of organisms on special stains rules out infectious causes. 
The patient's history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, fatigue, night sweats, weight loss, and laboratory findings such as anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevated inflammatory markers, and deep vein thrombosis are concerning for an underlying systemic disease in an older patient. However, there are no definitive indications for bone marrow biopsy with flow cytometry and cytogenetics in this case. This option can be considered if there is a high suspicion for an underlying hematologic malignancy, which is not established in this case. 
Incision and drainage of the skin lesions is not recommended because pyoderma gangrenosum is not an infective process that can be addressed by drainage. This may even exacerbate the condition. It is important to treat the underlying disease rather than focusing on local management. 
Prescribing oral dapsone is the most appropriate next step in management. Dapsone is an effective treatment for pyoderma gangrenosum, and it also has anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties. It can provide symptomatic relief and aid in the healing of the skin lesions. However, it is important to identify and address the underlying systemic disease to prevent recurrence. In this case, the patient should also be referred to a specialist for further evaluation and management of the associated systemic condition.

C: Prescribe a nonsedating antihistamine at a standard dose and increase to high-dose antihistamine if symptoms persist.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the case presentation, the patient developed pruritic wheals and transient eyelid swelling 12 days after receiving the COVID-19 mRNA booster vaccine. The rash spread over the neck, chest, trunk, and arms, with each lesion fading without scarring within 24 hours. The patient did not experience symptoms such as lip, tongue, or neck swelling; shortness of breath; wheezing; chest pain; or palpitations. 
These symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of acute urticaria, which is a type of hypersensitivity reaction commonly associated with allergies. In this case, it is likely a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to the COVID-19 mRNA booster vaccine. 

The initial management for urticaria involves prescribing a nonsedating antihistamine at a standard dose. Antihistamines can help alleviate itching and reduce the appearance of hives. If symptoms persist, the dose of antihistamine can be increased to a higher dose. 

Therefore, the appropriate next step in managing this patient would be to prescribe a nonsedating antihistamine at a standard dose and increase to high-dose antihistamine if symptoms persist.

Reasoning: 

Based on the history of previous left superficial parotidectomy for a Warthin tumor, the presence of a small lump over the left neck, and pain that worsens on touch and head turning, it is important to consider the possibility of a recurrent parotid tumor. The duration and intermittent nature of the pain, lasting only a few minutes each time, is also consistent with this diagnosis. 

Other differential diagnoses such as reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, greater auricular nerve neuroma, and metastatic tumor deposit may not fully explain the clinical presentation and history of parotidectomy for a Warthin tumor. 

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is **C: Recurrent parotid tumor**.

D: Transscleral cyclophotocoagulation and removal of the mass and Ahmed valve.

**Reasoning**: The patient presents with a large, firm, subconjunctival mass inferotemporally near the Ahmed valve. Given the patient's history of multiple ocular surgeries, including retinal detachment and glaucoma procedures, it is likely that the mass is related to these previous surgeries and may be causing the blurred vision and growing, bulging mass.

Considering the patient's high risk of retinal redetachment and the presence of a stable peripheral tractional retinal detachment, it is important to address the mass to ensure the stability of the retina. Transscleral cyclophotocoagulation can be performed to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) and manage the intractable glaucoma. Additionally, removing the mass and the Ahmed valve may help improve the patient's symptoms and prevent further complications.

Therefore, the appropriate next step would be transscleral cyclophotocoagulation and removal of the mass and Ahmed valve (D).

C) Perform bone marrow biopsy.

**Reasoning**:

The patient's clinical presentation includes anemia, leukopenia, elevated inflammatory markers, and papilledema. These findings, along with the diffuse signal abnormality in the bone marrow compartment on MRI, suggest an underlying hematological disorder. A bone marrow biopsy can help determine the cause of the patient's anemia and leukopenia, which may be contributing to the development of papilledema. This is an appropriate next step in the workup of the patient.

B) Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbit.

**Reasoning**:
In a patient with new-onset fluctuating diplopia and worsening ptosis, it is important to investigate the underlying cause. The lack of improvement after previous ptosis repair suggests an underlying neurologic etiology. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbit can help evaluate for any structural abnormalities, such as tumors or vascular malformations, that may be causing the symptoms. This imaging will provide important information to guide further management and treatment.

Reasoning: Based on the clinical presentation of the patient, with symptoms of blurry vision, ocular pain, and subconjunctival yellow discoloration in the left eye, along with the presence of an intraocular mass and suspicious retinal detachment, the most appropriate step would be to rule out an occult systemic neoplasm (Answer D). This is because the patient has no history of jaundice or cutaneous melanoma, and the presence of an intraocular mass raises concerns for a potential metastatic tumor from an unknown primary site.

The other options can be ruled out based on the clinical presentation:
- Investigating liver dysfunction and biliary tract obstruction (Answer A) would be indicated if the patient had symptoms suggestive of liver dysfunction or jaundice, which is not described in the case.
- Draining the hemorrhage with scleral windows (Answer B) would not be appropriate as the primary concern is the presence of an intraocular mass, and this procedure would not address that issue.
- Treating with plaque brachytherapy (Answer C) can be considered for choroidal melanoma but is not the next step in this case as it is important to first evaluate for an occult systemic neoplasm before proceeding with definitive treatment.

Therefore, the next step would be to rule out an occult systemic neoplasm (Answer D).

B) Radiation recall myelopathy: continue steroids, discontinue doxorubicin.

**Reasoning**:

The patient's symptoms of bilateral lower extremity numbness, pain, weakness, and imbalance, along with the MRI findings of extensive spinal cord edema and a posterior ring-enhancing intramedullary lesion without mass effect, are concerning for radiation recall myelopathy.

Radiation recall myelopathy is a rare adverse effect of radiation therapy, characterized by the reactivation of radiation-induced inflammation in previously irradiated tissues. It typically presents with symptoms similar to acute radiation myelopathy, such as progressive neurological deficits.

The lack of definitive F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) avidity at the intramedullary lesion on PET/CT scan and the absence of malignant cells on lumbar puncture suggest that the intramedullary lesion is not due to metastatic progression. Additionally, the symptoms remaining stable with steroid treatment further support the diagnosis of radiation recall myelopathy.

The treatment approach for radiation recall myelopathy involves continuing high-dose steroids to reduce inflammation and discontinuing the causative agent, in this case, liposomal doxorubicin. Therefore, the appropriate course of action for this patient would be to continue steroids and discontinue liposomal doxorubicin.

Note: It is important to mention that the final diagnosis and treatment should be made by a healthcare professional based on the patient's complete clinical evaluation and additional diagnostic tests if necessary. The information provided here is for educational purposes only.

**Reasoning**: 

Based on the clinical presentation, this patient has been experiencing gradual onset of facial and jaw symptoms over the past 5 years, with minimal relief from medical therapies. The presence of paresthesia in the right trigeminal nerve distribution (V2 and V3) indicates involvement of the trigeminal nerve. The MRI findings of a cystic mass in the right infratemporal fossa further support the diagnosis of a nerve-related lesion.

A: Encephalocele is unlikely in this case as it typically presents with herniation of intracranial contents through a skull defect.

B: A deep lobe parotid tumor is unlikely as it typically presents with painless, slow-growing, and palpable swellings in the parotid gland region, whereas this patient's symptoms are related to the trigeminal nerve distribution.

C: Trigeminal schwannoma is a benign nerve sheath tumor that can affect the trigeminal nerve. It commonly presents with pain, paresthesia, and numbness along the affected nerve distribution. The MRI findings of a cystic mass in the infratemporal fossa is consistent with a trigeminal schwannoma.

D: Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma usually presents with recurrent epistaxis and nasal obstruction. While it can extend into the infratemporal fossa, it typically arises from the nasopharynx and is not cystic on MRI.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and the involvement of the trigeminal nerve distribution, the most likely diagnosis is **C: Trigeminal schwannoma**.

B: Aquagenic syringeal acrokeratoderma

**Reasoning**:

Based on the clinical presentation and histopathologic features described in the case, the most likely diagnosis is Aquagenic syringeal acrokeratoderma. This condition is characterized by the appearance of white papules, hyperkeratosis, and excessive wrinkling on the hands after water immersion. The symptoms worsen in summer and remit in winter, which is consistent with the patient's presentation. The absence of a family history of similar skin problems and lack of association with other conditions (such as hyperhidrosis, cystic fibrosis, atopy, or trauma) also support this diagnosis.

Eczema (choice A) was initially diagnosed and treated with topical tretinoin without significant improvement. The histopathologic features of the skin biopsy do not align with the typical findings in eczema.

Hereditary papulotranslucent acrokeratoderma (choice C) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by translucent papules on the hands, but it does not involve excessive wrinkling after water immersion.

Progressive symmetric erythrokeratoderma (choice D) is a genetic disorder characterized by red, scaly plaques that spread symmetrically over time. It does not present with excessive wrinkling after water immersion.

**Reasoning**:

The patient in this case presents with erythema and edematous necrotic plaques on the bilateral ears. These symptoms developed three days after admission and progressed over the following days. Given the patient's medical history of factor VII deficiency hemophilia and the presence of Staphylococcus hemolyticus bacteremia, it is important to consider potential causes for necrotic plaques in this context.

Option A: Pressure necrosis is unlikely in this case as there were no devices used on the ears.

Option B: Levamisole-induced vasculitis is associated with cocaine use, but there is no mention of any cocaine use in the case.

Option C: COVID-19-associated acroischemia (thrombotic vasculopathy) is a manifestation of COVID-19 resulting from microvascular thrombosis. It is characterized by acral erythema, livedo reticularis, and may progress to necrosis. Given the patient's history of COVID-19 and the presentation of erythema and necrotic plaques on the ears, this is a possible diagnosis.

Option D: Nonpseudomonal ecthyma gangrenosum typically presents as a rapidly progressive, necrotic cutaneous infection associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia. There is no mention of Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteremia in the case, making this diagnosis less likely.

A: Obtain a chest computed tomography (CT) scan and myositis-specific autoantibody panel

**Reasoning**:
Based on the patient's clinical presentation of painful digital ulcers, dyspnea on exertion, crackles on lung auscultation, and livedo racemosa, the most likely diagnosis is systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) with associated pulmonary involvement. 

To confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of pulmonary involvement, a chest CT scan should be obtained. This will help evaluate for interstitial lung disease, pulmonary fibrosis, or pulmonary hypertension, which are common pulmonary complications of systemic sclerosis. It will also provide important information for treatment planning.

In addition, since the patient's symptoms and findings are consistent with a systemic autoimmune disease, it is important to evaluate for specific autoantibodies. Myositis-specific autoantibodies can help differentiate between different subtypes of scleroderma, such as limited cutaneous scleroderma (with anticentromere antibodies) and diffuse cutaneous scleroderma (with anti-SCL-70 antibodies). These antibodies can also predict the risk of certain complications and guide treatment decisions. Therefore, ordering a myositis-specific autoantibody panel is appropriate in this case.

Testing for anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody is more specific for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and not typically associated with scleroderma. Muscle biopsy is not indicated based on the absence of muscle weakness or elevated creatine kinase level in this patient.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of bilateral periorbital pain and swelling with diplopia and pain with extraocular movement, along with the presence of bilateral lateral rectus muscle enlargement and mild enlargement of the left medial rectus muscle on orbital computed tomography, suggest orbital inflammation. However, in adult patients with orbital inflammation, it is important to investigate for an underlying cause, such as malignancy. Therefore, the next step would be to perform further imaging to exclude a solid-organ primary malignancy.

D: Perform a clear lens exchange in the left eye.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the patient developed subretinal fluid and choroidal effusions after a successful laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) in her left eye. This suggests that the LPI may have contributed to the worsening of her angle closure and subsequent complications.

Repeating the LPI in the left eye (option A) is unlikely to be helpful as it may further exacerbate the angle closure and potentially worsen the existing complications.

Performing an LPI in the right eye (option B) may be considered as a preventive measure to prevent angle closure in the unaffected eye. However, it does not address the ongoing complications in the left eye.

Sclerectomy in the left eye (option C) may be considered as a treatment option for angle closure, but it does not directly address the subretinal fluid and choroidal effusions.

Performing a clear lens exchange in the left eye (option D) is the most appropriate course of action. The clear lens exchange involves removing the natural lens and replacing it with an artificial intraocular lens, which can help to relieve the angle closure and potentially resolve the subretinal fluid and choroidal effusions.

C: Perform ciliary body–choroidal biopsy in the right eye.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the patient is presenting with a Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome-like syndrome. VKH syndrome is an ocular disorder characterized by bilateral panuveitis, exudative retinal detachments, multifocal choroiditis, and skin and hair depigmentation. This patient has bilateral serous retinal detachments (RD), choroidal thickening, and undulations, which are consistent with VKH syndrome. 

To confirm the diagnosis and differentiate between VKH syndrome, a lymphoproliferative disorder, or sarcoidosis, a ciliary body-choroidal biopsy can be performed in the right eye. A biopsy of the affected tissue can help identify the underlying cause of the inflammation and rule out lymphoma or sarcoidosis. Other diagnostic tests, such as a vitrectomy or intravitreal antibiotics for endophthalmitis, are not indicated in this case. 

Treatment for VKH syndrome involves systemic steroids to reduce inflammation and prevent disease progression. However, before initiating treatment, it is important to establish a definitive diagnosis through biopsy.

C) Sjogren disease

**Reasoning**:
In this case, the patient presented with bilateral linear oral ulcerations and facial swelling. The presence of persistent oral pain and scarring in the mandibular buccal vestibule, along with aphthous ulcerations, suggests a chronic inflammatory condition. The histologic findings of diffuse plasmalymphocytic infiltrates and noncaseating granulomatous inflammation are consistent with Sjogren disease, an autoimmune disorder characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of salivary glands and other exocrine glands. Sjogren disease can present with oral manifestations such as oral ulcers, mucosal dryness, and salivary gland enlargement, which can cause facial swelling. This condition can also be associated with systemic symptoms and may occur in patients with other autoimmune diseases. It is important to obtain further evaluation and testing, including salivary gland function tests, anti-SSA (Ro) and anti-SSB (La) antibody testing, and a lip biopsy, to confirm the diagnosis of Sjogren disease.

C) Lymphoma.

**Reasoning**:
- The patient initially presented with hoarseness of voice and intermittent dry cough, which are common symptoms of laryngopharyngeal reflux. However, the diagnosis of laryngopharyngeal reflux was made based on the absence of other suggestive symptoms and normal physical examination findings.
- The patient returned 3 months later with worsening hoarseness. The repeat nasoendoscopy revealed left vocal cord palsy in the paramedian position. This finding suggests a neurological involvement, possibly due to an underlying tumor that impinged on the vagus nerve or its recurrent branch.
- A CT scan showed an ill-defined soft tissue mass in the left supraclavicular, prevertebral, and paravertebral regions, encasing the left common carotid, subclavian, and vertebral arteries. This area corresponds to the expected course of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve and likely accounts for the left vocal cord palsy. The primary site of the disease, however, remained unclear.
- To further investigate the extent and nature of the disease, a PET/CT scan with FDG tracer was performed. This diagnostic modality is often used to detect abnormal metabolic activity associated with cancer.
- Based on the given information, the likely diagnosis is lymphoma. Lymphomas can affect the lymph nodes and other sites, including the larynx. The presence of an ill-defined soft tissue mass and nodal disease on imaging supports this possibility. Further diagnostic evaluation, such as a biopsy, would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Other options such as laryngeal cancer, metastatic colon cancer, or esophageal cancer were not strongly indicated in the case.

C: Porokeratosis

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation and histologic findings, the most likely diagnosis is porokeratosis.

Lichen spinulosus typically presents as small, keratotic, spiny papules that are symmetrically distributed over the trunk and extremities. In this case, the lesions are only present on the left side of the body, making lichen spinulosus less likely.

Multiple minute digitate hyperkeratosis is characterized by small, finger-like projections on the skin, typically affecting the palms and soles. In this case, the lesions are not present on the palms or soles and are asymmetrically distributed, making multiple minute digitate hyperkeratosis less likely.

Viral warts usually present as skin-colored or hyperpigmented papules or nodules with a rough surface, often with a verrucous appearance. The lesions in this case do not have the typical appearance of viral warts.

Porokeratosis is a disorder of keratinization that presents with small, raised, keratotic papules or annular plaques. It frequently affects one side of the body and can progress proximally over time, as seen in this patient. The histologic findings of orthokeratosis with parakeratotic columns are consistent with a diagnosis of porokeratosis.

C: Palisaded neutrophilic and granulomatous dermatitis.

**Reasoning**:
- The patient's presenting symptoms include cutaneous lesions, asthenia, and intermittent arthralgias.
- Physical examination reveals erythematous to hyperpigmented monomorphic keratotic papules on the head, trunk, and extremities, as well as annular brown erythematous plaques on the cheeks and temples.
- Laboratory investigations show mild anemia, hypocomplementemia, and moderate proteinuria.
- Autoimmune serology results reveal raised levels of antinuclear antibodies, anti-Smith antibodies, SSA/Ro antibodies, SSB/La antibodies, and anti-U1RNP antibodies.
- The biopsy results show palisaded neutrophilic and granulomatous dermatitis.

Taken together, these findings are consistent with the diagnosis of palisaded neutrophilic and granulomatous dermatitis.

B) Consult cardiovascular surgery to discuss mitral valve surgery

**Reasoning**:
The patient is presenting with severe mitral regurgitation (MR) on the echocardiogram, which is likely causing the symptoms of hematuria and hemolysis. This is evident from the low-flow alarms on the device console and the presence of pulmonary edema on chest radiography. Transesophageal echocardiogram also confirms severe MR.

Given the severity of the MR and the symptoms it is causing, the next step would be to consult cardiovascular surgery to discuss mitral valve surgery. Mitral valve surgery can be performed to repair or replace the valve, depending on the suitability of the patient.

Medical therapy with vasodilators for afterload reduction may not adequately address the underlying issue of severe MR and may not provide sufficient relief of symptoms.

Consulting interventional cardiology to discuss transcatheter mitral valve repair may be an option, but given the severity of the MR and the need for immediate intervention, cardiovascular surgery is more appropriate in this scenario.

Removing the pVAD at bedside would not address the underlying issue of severe MR and may worsen the patient's symptoms and hemodynamic stability.

B: Fluorescein angiography

**Reasoning**:
Based on the history and examination findings, the patient is presenting with a blurred spot in the central vision of the right eye, along with subretinal fluid and cystoid spaces in the macula. The patient's history of normal-tension glaucoma and enlarged cup-disc ratio suggests a potential underlying vascular pathology.

Fluorescein angiography is a useful diagnostic tool to evaluate the retinal and choroidal circulation. It can help identify any abnormalities or leakage in the macular area, which can be seen as hyperfluorescent areas in the early phases of angiography.

In this case, considering the presence of subretinal fluid and cystoid spaces, it would be important to assess the macular circulation and rule out any vascular abnormalities. Therefore, fluorescein angiography would be the appropriate next step in the management of this patient.

C: Repeat aqueous or vitreous sampling

**Reasoning**:
Given the patient's symptoms of decreased vision and eye pain, along with the findings of diffuse conjunctival hyperemia, high cell count in the anterior chamber, vitritis, and scleral thickening, it is important to consider the possibility of an infectious etiology. The initial vitreous tap and injection of antibiotics did not yield any growth on culture, suggesting the need for further sampling to identify the underlying pathogen.

Repeat aqueous or vitreous sampling can help obtain a fresh sample for culture, which may increase the chances of detecting the causative organism. This is important for guiding appropriate treatment, as infectious causes such as endophthalmitis or posterior segment infection can cause significant visual morbidity if left untreated.

Starting topical and systemic steroids (Option A) may worsen the infection if it is of an infectious etiology, and should be avoided until an infectious cause has been ruled out.

Switching to intravenous meropenem (Option B) is not indicated at this point as there is no indication that the current treatment regimen is ineffective. Additionally, meropenem is not a commonly used antibiotic for ocular infections.

Observing while receiving current therapy (Option D) is not recommended given the worsening of symptoms and the presence of significant findings on examination.

Repeat aqueous or vitreous sampling is the most appropriate next step in order to identify the causative organism and guide further management.

Reasoning:
Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis in this case is a chronic sialadenitis with abscess (Choice C). The patient has a history of a fluctuating parotid mass for 3 years, which is suggestive of a chronic process. The imaging findings of a peripherally enhancing, centrally necrotic lesion overlying the parotid gland with necrotic lymph nodes within the parotid gland are consistent with an abscess. The negative infectious workup results for Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, HIV, and tuberculosis (TB) also help to rule out other infectious causes.

Reasoning: The wide complex QRS observed during sotalol administration is concerning for a potential adverse drug effect. Sotalol is a class III antiarrhythmic drug that can cause QT interval prolongation and potentially lead to ventricular arrhythmias, including torsades de pointes. This can manifest as a wide complex QRS on the EKG. Given the patient's history of cardiac arrest with adenosine administration, it is important to further evaluate and monitor for any potential arrhythmias.

Reasoning: The patient's history and physical examination findings are consistent with a traumatic injury to the right side of the head followed by bilateral upper eyelid ecchymosis and edema. The absence of acute distress, intact extraocular movements, reactive pupils without afferent pupillary defect, and normal anterior and dilated fundoscopic examinations further support a benign etiology. Given the lack of concerning findings and the self-limiting nature of traumatic ecchymosis and edema, the most appropriate next step would be reassurance and conservative management with cool compresses and artificial tears.

**Reasoning**: 

Given the clinical presentation of a 59-year-old Asian man with a solitary, elevated choroidal lesion in the macular region involving the optic disc, along with the imaging findings of a dome-shaped choroidal mass with suspicious scleral invasion, the next step would be to perform a comprehensive systemic workup.

The patient's symptoms, in conjunction with the imaging findings, suggest the possibility of a choroidal malignancy. In order to determine the nature of the mass and guide further management, a systemic workup is necessary. This will help identify any underlying systemic conditions or malignancies that could be contributing to the ocular findings.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a comprehensive systemic workup (D).

B: Obtain aqueous sample for cultures and polymerase chain reaction.

**Reasoning:**
The patient has presented with a retinal detachment and vitritis, which can be indicative of an infectious etiology. Given the patient's history of recent travel and febrile illness, it is important to rule out an infectious cause. Obtaining an aqueous sample for cultures and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) would help identify any potential infectious agents. This is the recommended next step in the management of this patient. Intravitreal antibiotics and vitrectomy can be considered based on the results of the culture and PCR analysis. Beginning oral prednisone would not be appropriate at this stage as the underlying cause of the retinal detachment is not yet determined.

D: Obtain thoracic lymph node biopsy. 

**Reasoning**: 
The 12-year-old girl has a history of bilateral panuveitis with occlusive retinal periphlebitis, elevated inflammatory markers, and subcentimeter chest and abdominal lymph nodes. She was treated with RIPE therapy for presumed tuberculosis due to a positive interferon-γ release assay. However, despite completing the RIPE therapy, she now presents with new bilateral lower extremity weakness and lower back pain.

Given her symptoms and abnormal imaging findings, further investigation is necessary to determine the cause of her myeloradiculopathy. Obtaining a thoracic lymph node biopsy would help evaluate for other possible infectious or inflammatory causes, such as sarcoidosis or lymphoma, which could be contributing to her symptoms. This will provide important diagnostic information for appropriate management of her condition.

Plasmapheresis may be considered if there is evidence of an autoimmune or inflammatory etiology; however, the absence of elevated inflammatory markers, antinuclear antibody, and negative testing for Lyme disease, syphilis, and HIV argue against this being the most appropriate next step.

Performing a lacrimal gland biopsy is unlikely to provide helpful diagnostic information in this case, as the lacrimal gland prominence seen on MRI is a nonspecific finding and the primary concern is the etiology of her myeloradiculopathy.

Reinitiating RIPE therapy is not warranted as the patient has completed the course and is currently taking mycophenolate mofetil with resolution of ocular manifestations. The current symptoms are not consistent with active tuberculosis.

C: Connective tissue nevus.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the patient's clinical presentation of asymptomatic congenital papules, plaques, and nodules distributed along Blaschko lines on the scalp and face, and the presence of sparse vellus hairs and multiple hair follicles on the lesions, the most likely diagnosis is a connective tissue nevus.

A hair follicle nevus is characterized by an overgrowth of hair follicles, but in this case, there are sparse vellus hairs and multiple hair follicles on the lesions, suggesting a different diagnosis.

A sebaceous nevus typically presents as a linear plaque with yellowish nodules and lacks the presence of sparse vellus hairs and multiple hair follicles in this case.

A trichofolliculoma is a benign tumor originating from the hair follicles and would likely not distribute along Blaschko lines as seen in this case. Additionally, there is no mention of a well-defined tumor in the clinical presentation.

Therefore, the most appropriate diagnosis based on the given information is a connective tissue nevus.

**Reasoning**: 
In this case, the patient presents with exertional dyspnea and an isolated reduced diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (Dlco). The hemoglobin level is within the normal range, indicating that the reduced Dlco cannot be explained by anemia or abnormal hemoglobin levels. 

Option A can be ruled out because the hemoglobin level is normal. Option B can also be ruled out because the reduced Dlco is not insignificant, as it may be an important finding in this patient's evaluation. 

Option C is the most likely explanation. The isolated reduced Dlco suggests an alveolar-capillary gas transfer abnormality, such as in conditions like interstitial lung disease or emphysema, which can impair gas exchange in the lungs. This abnormality can lead to dyspnea on exertion, which is consistent with the patient's presentation. 
 
Option D, early small airway disease, is less likely as the isolated reduced Dlco is more suggestive of an alveolar-capillary gas transfer abnormality. Small airway disease would likely be associated with obstructive lung function abnormalities, which are not seen in this case.

B: Neuroschistosomiasis 

**Reasoning**:

Neuroschistosomiasis is a parasitic infection caused by Schistosoma mansoni, Schistosoma haematobium, or Schistosoma japonicum. It primarily affects the central nervous system, including the brain and spinal cord. The patient's history of travel to northeastern Brazil, where schistosomiasis is endemic, raises suspicion for neuroschistosomiasis.

The clinical presentation of headache, dysarthria, double vision, dizziness, and neurological deficits such as right-sided hemiparesis are consistent with neuroschistosomiasis. The broad-based gait and hemiataxia may be related to the involvement of the brainstem.

The imaging findings of T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintense lesion with heterogeneous gadolinium enhancement in the pons further support the diagnosis of neuroschistosomiasis.

The laboratory findings show eosinophilia, which is commonly seen in schistosomiasis infections. Additionally, the CSF analysis reveals eosinophils, lymphocytes, and elevated protein levels. The presence of bilateral patchy pulmonary infiltrates on chest CT supports the diagnosis as schistosomiasis can cause pulmonary involvement.

Listeriosis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Churg-Strauss syndrome), and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder do not typically present with the combination of symptoms and imaging findings described in this case.

B: Perform vitreal sampling for cytology and flow cytometry.

**Reasoning**:
The patient in this case has been diagnosed with HIV and is receiving chemotherapy for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. The sudden onset of blurred vision and extensive macular hemorrhage suggests a potential ocular manifestation of the patient's underlying condition.

Given the patient's immunocompromised state and the possibility of opportunistic infections, it is important to consider infectious causes of ocular symptoms. Therefore, performing vitreal sampling for cytology and flow cytometry can help identify any infectious agents, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) or other opportunistic pathogens, which could be causing the patient's visual disturbances. This test can also help identify any malignancy or lymphoma involvement in the eye.

Although acyclovir and ganciclovir are antiviral medications commonly used to treat viral infections, starting them empirically without a proper diagnosis may delay appropriate treatment. Similarly, initiating azathioprine and infliximab, immunosuppressive agents used in inflammatory conditions, is not indicated in this patient with suspected infectious or malignancy-related ocular manifestations.

Therefore, the next appropriate step would be to perform vitreal sampling for cytology and flow cytometry to determine the cause of the patient's blurred vision.

D: Perform right axillary ultrasound now, with intent to biopsy enlarged lymph nodes.

**Reasoning**:

In this case, the patient has been diagnosed with breast cancer (high-grade, estrogen receptor-positive DCIS) and is found to have enlarged and morphologically abnormal axillary lymph nodes on breast MRI. This raises concern for axillary lymphadenopathy, which could potentially indicate metastasis of the breast cancer.

Given the clinical findings, it is important to evaluate the axillary lymph nodes further to determine if they are involved with metastatic disease. The most appropriate next step is to perform a right axillary ultrasound now, with the intent to biopsy the enlarged lymph nodes.

Performing a repeat breast MRI 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination is not the most appropriate next step, as the primary concern in this case is the evaluation of axillary lymph nodes, not the breast tissue.

Performing right axillary ultrasound 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination is also not the most appropriate next step, as there is already a clinical concern for axillary lymphadenopathy, and further evaluation is warranted.

Performing an axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy at the time of lumpectomy is not the most appropriate next step, as it does not provide immediate information about the status of the axillary lymph nodes prior to surgery. Additionally, it may be helpful to perform a biopsy of the abnormal lymph nodes prior to making a decision regarding surgical management.

B) Perform a bone biopsy.

**Reasoning**:
The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are suggestive of a metabolic bone disorder. The diffuse joint pain and swelling, along with the elevated alkaline phosphatase level, indicate a possible bone pathology. The elevated parathyroid hormone levels suggest that tertiary hyperparathyroidism may be contributing to the bone abnormalities.

Performing a bone biopsy would provide additional information about the bone pathology and help in making a definitive diagnosis. It can help identify the underlying cause of the polyarthralgia and swelling, such as osteitis fibrosa cystica, which is a complication of tertiary hyperparathyroidism.

Obtaining a positron emission computed tomography (PET) scan is not necessary in this case as there is no evidence suggesting a malignancy or infection that would warrant a PET scan at this point.

Scheduling a parathyroidectomy would be premature without confirming the presence of a parathyroid pathology. Performing a bone biopsy can help determine whether parathyroidectomy is necessary.

Stopping voriconazole would be appropriate if it is suspected to be the cause of the symptoms, but there is no clear evidence in the case description to suggest voriconazole as the culprit. Therefore, more investigations are needed before considering discontinuation of voriconazole.

C) Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits.

**Reasoning**:
The patient presents with subacute-onset blurry vision in both eyes, floaters, and mild headache. The fundus examination reveals peripapillary intraretinal and preretinal hemorrhages obscuring the optic disc margins in both eyes. These findings suggest optic nerve involvement.

Given the patient's medical history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) refractory to multiple tyrosine kinase inhibitors, it is important to rule out any central nervous system (CNS) involvement. The most appropriate next step in the evaluation of this patient is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits to assess for any CNS pathology, such as leukemic infiltration or intracranial hemorrhage.

Therefore, the correct answer is C) Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits.

B: Measure blood glucose levels

**Reasoning**:
The patient presents with a history of persistent blurred area in the right lower visual field of both eyes, with colors surrounding the dark area. This is indicative of visual phenomena known as fortification spectra, which are typically seen in migraine with aura. Additionally, the patient reports feeling lethargic, with polydipsia, and a dull mild holocephalic headache. These symptoms are consistent with the classic triad of symptoms seen in diabetes mellitus: polyuria, polydipsia, and polyphagia.

Given the patient's symptoms, it is important to assess for elevated blood glucose levels. Measuring blood glucose levels will help evaluate for possible diabetes as an underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. High blood glucose levels can cause visual disturbances, including homonymous hemianopia, due to the involvement of the occipital cortex.

Measuring C-reactive protein (CRP) level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) would not be indicated in this case, as there are no findings suggestive of an inflammatory or infectious process.

Performing a lumbar puncture to assess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) contents would not be the next step in this case, as there is no indication of raised intracranial pressure or infectious process. The normal results from the noncontrast CT scan of the head also do not support the need for a lumbar puncture at this time.

Performing magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the head is not indicated in this case, as there are no signs or symptoms suggestive of vascular pathology. The imaging findings on the MRI showing subtle abnormality involving the left occipital cortex are consistent with the patient's symptoms of visual disturbances.

**Reasoning**: 
Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the initial presumptive diagnosis of optic neuritis was made. However, the lack of improvement with treatment and the progression of symptoms despite therapy raise concerns for an alternative diagnosis, such as an optic nerve glioma. A second MRI revealed a fusiform expansion of the right optic nerve, which is suggestive of an optic nerve glioma.

Based on the clinical presentation of a middle-aged man with recurrent respiratory infections, diarrhea, oral erosions, and a mediastinal mass, the most likely diagnosis is Thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity. Thymoma is known to be associated with various autoimmune disorders, including oral lichenoid lesions. The presence of hypogammaglobulinemia further supports the diagnosis of thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity. The histopathologic features of the mediastinal mass are consistent with a type AB thymoma, which is commonly associated with autoimmune manifestations.

Reasoning: 
Given the patient's age, symptoms of palpitations, chest pain, and shortness of breath, along with the presence of T-wave inversions in precordial leads V1 through V3 on the electrocardiogram (EKG), we should consider a possible diagnosis of Myocarditis. In myocarditis, the inflammation of the heart muscle can lead to arrhythmias and EKG changes, such as T-wave inversions. 

The patient's vital signs are stable, and the cardiopulmonary examination, blood tests, and cardiac troponins are all within normal limits, suggesting a relatively low risk. Therefore, non-invasive imaging modalities would be preferred to further assess the patient for myocarditis. 

Option C: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) is the best next step in evaluating for myocarditis. CMRI can provide detailed information about myocardial inflammation, fibrosis, and function, making it an excellent tool for diagnosing myocarditis and assessing its severity. It can also rule out other potential structural abnormalities.

Therefore, the next step would be to perform a Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI).

B) Disseminated discoid lupus

**Reasoning**:
Based on the description of the skin lesions in the patient, which consisted of hypopigmented papules with central hyperpigmented umbilication and larger papules with typical central atrophic porcelain white scarring, the most likely diagnosis is disseminated discoid lupus. This is a chronic autoimmune condition that affects the skin, causing characteristic skin lesions. The patient's extensive workup for malignancy and autoimmune diseases was negative, further supporting the diagnosis of a non-neoplastic, non-inflammatory condition like disseminated discoid lupus. Other options such as malignant atrophic papulosis, scleromyxoedema, and secondary syphilis do not fit with the clinical presentation and findings.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation of a 48-year-old woman with arthralgias, eye pain, and a purpuric rash with hemorrhagic vesicles, along with a biopsy showing neutrophilic infiltrate and leukocytoclasia in blood vessels, the most likely diagnosis is leukocytoclastic vasculitis. This is supported by the negative findings on laboratory tests for systemic vasculitis, such as the absence of ANCA titers and negative immunofluorescence testing.

In this case, there are no specific features suggestive of a cardiac involvement or an infectious etiology such as chikungunya virus infection. Therefore, obtaining a transthoracic echocardiogram or checking chikungunya serology would not be the appropriate next step.

However, given that the patient presents with a purpuric rash and there is the possibility of an underlying infectious trigger, it would be appropriate to rule out Chlamydia trachomatis infection in this case. While this infection can present with various symptoms, including joint pain and eye involvement, it does not typically cause leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Nonetheless, a nucleic acid amplification test for Chlamydia trachomatis would help exclude an infectious cause and may be considered in the diagnostic workup.

Therefore, the appropriate next step would be to **order a urine nucleic acid amplification test for Chlamydia trachomatis** (Choice D).

**Reasoning**: 

Considering the patient's presentation, including pharyngitis, tonsillar exudates, neck swelling, and occasional dry cough, and the absence of other symptoms such as fever, chills, trismus, headache, dyspnea, chest pain, abdominal pain, fatigue, or rash, the most likely cause of the symptoms is infectious, particularly viral or bacterial pharyngitis. 

The patient's initial rapid strep test and heterophile antibody test (monospot) were negative, which makes group A streptococcal infection less likely. Additionally, the negative throat culture results further decrease the likelihood of bacterial infection. 

The presence of bilateral white tonsillar exudates and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy suggests a possible viral infection, such as infectious mononucleosis (caused by Epstein-Barr virus) or acute HIV infection. However, the absence of hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and other signs and symptoms associated with these infections makes them less likely.

Based on the presentation and the negative initial tests, it would be appropriate to recheck a rapid heterophile antibody test (monospot) to evaluate for infectious mononucleosis, which can sometimes produce false-negative results in the early stages of the disease. 

Therefore, the next step would be to recheck a rapid heterophile antibody test (monospot).

In this case, the 14-year-old boy presents with ocular and periocular pain, photophobia, conjunctival hyperemia, ciliary congestion, anterior chamber flare, nongranulomatous keratic precipitates, vitritis, and optic disc swelling. These symptoms and findings are consistent with anterior uveitis, which is inflammation of the front part of the eye. However, there are certain red flags in this case that warrant further investigation with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits.

First, the presence of optic disc swelling in both eyes, to a greater extent in the right eye, raises concern for possible optic neuritis, which is inflammation of the optic nerve. Optic neuritis can be a symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disease characterized by demyelination of the central nervous system. Therefore, an MRI of the brain and orbits is necessary to evaluate for signs of demyelination and aid in the diagnosis of MS.

Second, the boy has an elevated serum creatinine level (1.57 mg/dL), indicating possible kidney dysfunction. Kidney involvement is a known extraocular manifestation of certain systemic inflammatory diseases, such as sarcoidosis and granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis). These diseases can also cause anterior uveitis and optic disc swelling. However, since the boy's symptoms are unilateral and there are no other systemic manifestations, it is less likely that these diseases are the primary cause. Nonetheless, ordering a urinalysis and urinary β2-microglobulin test can help assess renal function and look for signs of kidney involvement.

Therefore, in this case, the most appropriate next step is to order an MRI of the brain and orbits to evaluate for optic neuritis and signs of demyelination associated with multiple sclerosis.

B: Perform lumbar puncture to analyze cellular composition of cerebrospinal fluid.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the patient's presentation of sudden-onset bilateral horizontal diplopia, left-sided upper eyelid ptosis, and drooling, along with other findings such as reduced sensation in the left V1-V3 distribution, mild flattening of the nasolabial fold, and slightly decreased corneal sensation on the left, there are multiple cranial nerves involved. 

This presentation is suggestive of a cavernous sinus syndrome. Possible causes of cavernous sinus syndrome include infections, inflammation, tumors, or vascular pathology. Lumbar puncture to analyze the cellular composition of the cerebrospinal fluid can help identify any underlying infection or inflammation. 

Obtaining a CT angiography of the head and neck would primarily evaluate the vascular structures and may not provide significant information in this case since the CT of the brain was normal.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with contrast may be considered if the initial tests, including lumbar puncture, are inconclusive or a specific lesion is suspected.
Ordering tests of inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and complete blood cell count) may be helpful in identifying any systemic inflammation, but they are not specific for determining the cause of the patient's symptoms.

Therefore, performing a lumbar puncture is the next appropriate step to further investigate the possible cause of the patient's symptoms.

Reasoning: The patient presents with bilateral eye redness and pain, which is concerning for an underlying inflammatory condition. The bilateral nature of the redness and pain, as well as the lack of intraocular inflammation on examination, suggests that this is likely an external ocular condition rather than an intraocular one. The patient's history of dry eye disease may contribute to his symptoms, but the lack of response to topical phenylephrine suggests that this is not simply related to dryness.

Given the patient's history of well-controlled HIV, it is important to consider the possibility of an infectious etiology for his symptoms. However, the absence of systemic symptoms, such as weight loss, fevers, or rash, makes an infectious cause less likely. Furthermore, the presence of scleral injection without scleral thinning argues against an infectious etiology.

Autoimmune diseases, such as scleritis, can present with bilateral eye redness and pain. Given the patient's history of dry eye disease and his HIV status, it is worth considering an autoimmune etiology. Therefore, a laboratory work-up for infectious and autoimmune diseases should be performed to evaluate for any underlying systemic autoimmune disease that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms.

Starting oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may provide some symptomatic relief, but it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Starting oral corticosteroids may also provide symptomatic relief, but given the lack of intraocular inflammation and the potential for systemic side effects, it is not the most appropriate initial management. Starting topical corticosteroids may provide some local anti-inflammatory effect, but it also does not address the underlying cause of the symptoms and may not adequately penetrate deep enough to reach the sclera.

C) Biopsy.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation, with sudden enlargement of the cystic iris stromal lesion and associated symptoms of cloudy vision and an ache around the left brow, it is important to evaluate the nature of the lesion. The presence of blood at the pupillary margin and a large amount of pigmented cells in the anterior chamber suggest potential malignancy or other pathological changes. Though the previous fine-needle aspiration was negative, it is important to ensure that the lesion has not transformed into malignancy or that there are no other underlying conditions. Therefore, performing a biopsy would provide a definitive diagnosis and guide further management.

C: Review and adjust systemic medications and treat with topical corticosteroids.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation of conjunctival hyperemia, cellular reaction, and small hypopyon in the left eye, along with the patient's history of pulmonary Mycobacterium avium infection, it is important to consider the possibility of bilateral infectious endophthalmitis. However, it is also important to note that there was only very light growth of Staphylococcus aureus in 1 colony on 1 plate from the vitreous sampling, which was highly suspicious for contamination.

Given the patient's medical history of hypogammaglobulinemia and treatment with clarithromycin, ethambutol, and rifabutin for reactivation of Mycobacterium avium infection, it is possible that the current vision loss in the left eye could be related to a systemic infection rather than a localized ocular infection.

Therefore, the next step would be to review and adjust the patient's systemic medications, considering the possibility of medication-related ocular complications or worsening of the underlying systemic infection. Treatment with topical corticosteroids can help manage the ocular inflammation and improve symptoms. In this case, a pars plana vitrectomy with hyperemia of intravitreal antibiotics may not be necessary as there is no strong evidence of bacterial infection in the vitreous.

The patient presents with a painful eruption on the bilateral lower extremities with retiform purpura and skin necrosis. The laboratory findings are also supportive, with mildly elevated D-dimer, prolonged prothrombin time, and elevated phosphorus levels. These findings are consistent with calciphylaxis, which is characterized by vascular calcification leading to tissue ischemia and necrosis. The biopsy findings of calcium deposits within the blood vessel walls and pseudoxanthoma elasticum-like changes further support this diagnosis. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Calciphylaxis.

D) Perform an endomyocardial biopsy.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, it is more likely that the patient has developed cardiac involvement of her lymphoma, rather than a primary cardiac tumor. The large echogenic mass on the interatrial septum with infiltration of various cardiac structures, along with the presence of other systemic lesions (e.g., hilar mass, nasal septum lesion, and Meckel cave lesions), suggest a metastatic spread of the lymphoma.

Performing a thoracoscopic biopsy of the hilar mass may not be the most appropriate next step, as the primary concern in this case is the intracardiac mass with potential obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract. The hilar mass may be related to the lymphoma, but it is not the immediate cause of the patient's symptoms.

An urgent surgical resection of the intracardiac mass may be considered, but it is not the best next step without confirming the diagnosis and assessing the extent of the disease. An endomyocardial biopsy would provide a tissue sample for histological examination and confirm the presence of lymphoma in the cardiac lesion.

Referring to an oncologist for further chemotherapy may be a suitable option, but it should be done after obtaining a definitive diagnosis through biopsy. The endomyocardial biopsy will provide crucial information about the nature of the intracardiac mass and guide appropriate treatment decisions.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in this case is to perform an endomyocardial biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.

A) Place the patient in airborne isolation and begin ethambutol, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and rifampin.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the patient's presentation of upper back pain, cough, and subjective fevers, along with imaging findings of lung consolidation and spinal cord compression, the differential diagnosis should include tuberculosis. The patient's history of immigration from India, negative interferon gamma release assay, and travel to India in the past increase the suspicion for tuberculosis.

The findings on the chest radiograph and chest computed tomography further support the possibility of tuberculosis, as they show prominent reticular markings and dense consolidation in the left lower lobe. The MRI of the spine also reveals signal abnormality and extensive contrast enhancement within the vertebral bodies, suggestive of tuberculous spondylitis.

Given these clinical findings, it is appropriate to place the patient in airborne isolation to prevent the spread of tuberculosis and to initiate a four-drug regimen consisting of ethambutol, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and rifampin. This combination is the appropriate first-line treatment for tuberculosis.

Measurement of prostate-specific antigen level (Option B) is not indicated in this case, as the patient's presentation and imaging findings do not suggest prostate-related pathology.

Starting cefepime and vancomycin (Option C) is not indicated, as there is no evidence to suggest an underlying bacterial infection, and the patient's symptoms and imaging findings are more consistent with tuberculosis.

Starting doxycycline, rifampin, and streptomycin (Option D) is not the appropriate treatment choice for tuberculosis. The standard first-line regimen for tuberculosis includes isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. Streptomycin is not typically recommended as part of the initial treatment, and doxycycline is not a first-line agent for tuberculosis.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to place the patient in airborne isolation and begin ethambutol, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and rifampin (Option A).

**Reasoning**: 

First, let's analyze the presenting symptoms and history of the patient. The patient has progressive lower extremity pain and gait imbalance for approximately 5 years, reduced pinprick sensation in both feet, absent vibratory sensation at the first toes, mild weakness of ankle dorsiflexion, and absent ankle jerk reflexes. The patient also has a slightly wide-based gait, high-arched feet, and hammer toes. 

Next, let's review the nerve conduction study (NCS) and needle electromyography (EMG) results shown in Table 1 and Table 2. 

In Table 1, the sensory nerve conduction studies in both sural nerves show decreased amplitudes, which suggests impaired sensory nerve function. 

In Table 2, the motor nerve conduction studies demonstrate low amplitudes, which indicate decreased muscle response to stimulation. Additionally, the electromyography (EMG) findings show spontaneous activity in the muscles tested, further supporting a diagnosis of neuropathy. 

Based on the combination of clinical symptoms and abnormal electrodiagnostic test results, the most likely interpretation is that the results are consistent with axonal polyneuropathy (Answer A). Axonal polyneuropathy involves damage to the axons of the peripheral nerves, resulting in impaired nerve functioning and the characteristic symptoms seen in this case.

**Reasoning**:

Based on the patient's clinical presentation of blue pigmentation of the skin, sclera, and teeth, along with laboratory findings of anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated bilirubin, this is consistent with a condition called hyperpigmentation due to minocycline-induced deposition of insoluble complexes.

Minocycline is a tetracycline antibiotic that can cause hyperpigmentation as a rare adverse effect. This hyperpigmentation typically affects areas of the body with the highest tissue concentration of minocycline, such as the skin, sclera, and teeth.

The treatment for minocycline-induced hyperpigmentation is discontinuation of the medication. Therefore, the correct answer is to discontinue minocycline. 

A: Discontinuing apixaban is not indicated based on the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings. 

B: Discontinuing minocycline is the correct course of action for the patient's condition.

C: Ordering serum iron studies would not provide relevant information for the patient's clinical presentation of hyperpigmentation.

C) Observation.

Reasoning: The patient is a 70-year-old woman with a history of glaucoma who presents with worsening vision in the left eye. On examination, there is evidence of macular schisis, which is the separation of the outer plexiform and outer nuclear layers of the retina. This condition is commonly associated with optic nerve pits, as seen in the findings of this case.

First, it is important to note that the patient's intraocular pressures (IOPs) are within normal range, indicating that elevated IOP is not the cause of the macular schisis.

The next step would be to determine the underlying cause of the macular schisis. However, there is no indication in the case that suggests the need for genetic testing at this point.

In this case, since the patient is asymptomatic and has stable visual acuity, observation would be the most appropriate course of action. It is important to monitor the patient's condition for any worsening or progression of the schisis over time. Regular follow-up visits and imaging studies, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT), would be recommended to monitor any changes in the macula and optic nerve head.

Therefore, the answer is C) Observation.

C: Genetic testing to rule out a mitochondrial disease.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the presentation and findings described in the case, the patient has bilateral macular atrophy, hearing loss, and a history of headache. These symptoms are suggestive of a syndromic condition known as mitochondrial disease. Mitochondrial diseases are a group of genetic disorders that affect the functioning of mitochondria, which are the energy-producing structures within cells.

Mitochondrial diseases often present with multisystem involvement, including the eyes, ears, and nervous system. In this case, bilateral macular atrophy and hearing loss are common manifestations of mitochondrial disease. Furthermore, the absence of a family history of similar symptoms does not exclude the possibility of a mitochondrial disorder, as mitochondrial diseases can arise due to new mutations.

To confirm or rule out mitochondrial disease as the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, genetic testing is necessary. This would involve analyzing mitochondrial DNA and/or nuclear genes associated with mitochondrial dysfunction.

A) Latent metastasis from the NSGCT

**Reasoning**: 

Based on the clinical history and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis in this case is a latent metastasis from the nonseminomatous germ cell tumor (NSGCT) of the right testicle. The patient had a history of NSGCT with metastasis to the retroperitoneal and mediastinal lymph nodes, which indicates that the cancer has already spread to distant sites. Additionally, the neck mass appeared after the patient completed chemotherapy, suggesting a recurrence or progression of the disease. The imaging findings of a bulky, cystic mass confined to left neck levels 3, 4, and 5 are consistent with metastasis rather than a lymphocele or benign teratoma. Growing teratoma syndrome is a possibility, but it typically presents as a mass that enlarges while the patient is on chemotherapy, rather than after completing treatment. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a latent metastasis from the NSGCT.

C: Extramedullary myeloid sarcoma of the larynx. 

**Reasoning**: 

Based on the clinical presentation of progressive hoarseness and dyspnea in a patient who had undergone allogeneic stem cell transplant, the differential diagnosis includes complications related to the transplant or relapse of the underlying disease. 

In this case, flexible laryngoscopy revealed a right vocal fold neoplasm crossing the posterior commissure with associated bilateral vocal fold motion impairment and obstruction of the glottic airway. The histologic findings of a diffuse infiltrate of large cells with irregular nuclear contours, vesicular chromatin, and prominent nucleoli, along with positive immunohistochemical stains for myeloid markers (CD33, CD43, CD117) and negative stains for lymphoid and epithelial markers (CD3, CD20, cytokeratin) support the diagnosis of extramedullary myeloid sarcoma. 

Extramedullary myeloid sarcoma is a rare manifestation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) characterized by the presence of myeloid blasts in extramedullary sites. It can occur in various locations, including the larynx. The patient's previous diagnosis of FLT3-ITD mutated AML, the absence of evidence of leukemia on bone marrow biopsy, and the presence of myeloid markers on immunohistochemistry further support this diagnosis. 

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is extramedullary myeloid sarcoma of the larynx (Answer C).

B: Intravascular involvement by NK/T-cell lymphoma.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the patient's history of nasal-type NK/T-cell lymphoma, the widespread skin eruption, and the biopsy findings showing intravascular atypical cells (CD56 positive), the most likely diagnosis is intravascular involvement by NK/T-cell lymphoma. This is supported by the absence of other specific diagnostic findings such as positive serologic tests for coccidioidomycosis or other infectious causes. Malignant neoplasm-associated microscopic polyangiitis is less likely as there is no evidence of systemic vasculitis or renal involvement. Cutaneous coccidioidomycosis would typically present with specific diagnostic findings such as positive serologic tests, which were negative in this case. Erythema nodosum usually presents as painful, erythematous nodules, which differs from the patient's presentation of widespread, nontender, erythematous patches and thin plaques.

Reasoning: 
Based on the clinical presentation of the patient with multiple progressive ulcers on the right side of the face, burning sensation, hypoesthesia of the right side of the face, and elevated inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein), the most likely diagnosis is Giant Cell Arteritis (GCA). Giant Cell Arteritis is an inflammatory condition that affects medium to large-sized arteries, predominantly in the head and neck region. It commonly presents with temporal headache, jaw claudication, visual disturbances, and can cause cranial neuropathies. In this case, the patient's symptoms and MRI findings are consistent with an extensive ischemic posterior circulation stroke involving the right occipital lobe and brainstem, which can be due to GCA. Additionally, the patient had recently undergone coronary angiography, which could be a trigger for the development of GCA symptoms. Trigeminal herpes zoster and Trigeminal trophic syndrome are less likely as they do not explain the systemic symptoms, inflammatory markers, or stroke findings. Pyoderma gangrenosum is unlikely as it typically presents as painful skin ulcers that are not limited to a specific dermatome.

The presence of a holosystolic murmur and positive blood cultures suggest infective endocarditis, which can lead to emboli and occlusion of retinal arteries. Prompt administration of antibiotics is crucial to treat the underlying infection and prevent further complications.

Therefore, the correct answer is A: Administer intravenous antibiotics.

C: Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits with contrast.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the patient's presentation of right ptosis and double vision, along with the findings of a complete limitation of elevation in the right eye and limitation of abduction in the left eye, further imaging is required to evaluate the underlying cause. The recommended next step in this case is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits with contrast. This will help to visualize any anatomical abnormalities or lesions that may be causing the symptoms. Additional tests such as complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein tests may be useful in ruling out infections or inflammatory conditions, but an imaging study is the most appropriate next step to further evaluate the patient's symptoms. Magnetic resonance angiography (Option B) is not indicated as there are no features to suggest a vascular abnormality. The ice pack test (Option D) may be used to help differentiate between myasthenia gravis and other causes of ocular motility disorders, but further imaging is needed to establish a diagnosis before proceeding to this test.

A: Advise tighter blood pressure control

**Reasoning**:
Based on the patient's history of hypertensive retinopathy and the presence of bilateral optic nerve edema, the most likely cause of his vision loss is hypertensive optic neuropathy. The normal findings on imaging and lumbar puncture, along with the improvement in visual acuity and the absence of optic nerve edema on follow-up examination, suggest that the optic nerve dysfunction is related to elevated blood pressure rather than an inflammatory or infectious process.

Therefore, the next step in the management of this patient would be to advise tighter blood pressure control to prevent further damage to the optic nerves and potentially improve his visual acuity. This can be achieved through lifestyle modifications (such as reducing sodium intake, increasing physical activity, and maintaining a healthy weight) and medication management with antihypertensive medications as appropriate.

C: Send to emergency department for admission and initiation of high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone sodium succinate therapy.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation of severe headaches and progressive bilateral vision loss, along with the findings of chorioretinal lesions on fundus examination and abnormal fundus autofluorescence, the most likely diagnosis is acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (APMPPE). APMPPE is a rare inflammatory disorder affecting young adults and is often associated with systemic symptoms like headaches.

Given the severity and progression of symptoms, it would be appropriate to admit the patient to the emergency department for further evaluation and treatment. High-dose intravenous corticosteroid treatment with methylprednisolone sodium succinate is the recommended therapy for APMPPE. This treatment aims to reduce inflammation and prevent further vision loss.

Sending for infectious and inflammatory tests alone without immediate treatment could delay necessary intervention for the patient. Referring for outpatient neurologic evaluation may not address the underlying inflammatory condition causing the symptoms. Therefore, the best course of action is to admit the patient to the emergency department for high-dose intravenous corticosteroid therapy.

Reasoning:

Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the most likely diagnosis in this case is D: EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer.

Soft palate defects with clean edges and shallow ulcers, as seen in this patient, are consistent with EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcers. The patient's positive IgG for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) indicates a previous exposure to the virus, which is commonly associated with this condition.

Other possible differential diagnoses include nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), autoimmune vasculitis, and squamous cell carcinoma. However, the absence of a nasopharyngeal mass, lymphadenopathy, cranial nerve palsies, and abnormal laboratory investigations makes these less likely.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation, negative investigative findings, and characteristic soft palate defects, the most likely diagnosis is EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer.

**Reasoning**: The clinical presentation of a neck mass, hoarseness of voice, and globus sensation, along with the physical examination findings of thyromegaly and a palpable nodule in the right lobe, are highly suggestive of thyroid pathology. The ultrasonography results show multinodular goiter with a dominant 4.6-cm right thyroid nodule. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy confirmed the presence of papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) in the left nodule and lymph node. The histologic examination of the right thyroid lesion shows an organoid zellballen pattern and tumor cells with amphophilic granular cytoplasm, round to oval nuclei, and salt-and-pepper chromatin, characteristic features of PTC.

Blau syndrome is a rare autosomal dominant autoinflammatory disease characterized by the triad of granulomatous dermatitis, arthritis, and uveitis. The skin findings in this case, such as ichthyosiform brownish plaques, and the histopathologic analysis showing noncaseating granulomas with multinucleated giant cells and neutrophil infiltration in the dermis and subcutis are consistent with Blau syndrome. The joint pain and inability to clench fists further support the diagnosis, as arthritis is a common manifestation of Blau syndrome. The absence of trichorrhexis invaginata or trichorrhexis nodosa seen on microscopic examination of the hair helps to rule out other conditions like Netherton syndrome. Pityriasis rubra pilaris typically presents with reddish-orange scaling plaques and is not associated with granuloma formation. Ichthyosis vulgaris is a common inherited ichthyosis but does not typically present with granulomatous skin lesions or joint involvement as seen in this case.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is D: Blau syndrome.

The next step in managing this patient would be to start an intra-aortic balloon pump (Answer D). 

The patient's clinical presentation with hypotension, exertional dyspnea, and diffuse ST-elevation on ECG raises concerns for acute myocardial infarction with cardiogenic shock. The presence of an LV wall-motion abnormality and an intracardiac mass further supports this diagnosis.

An intra-aortic balloon pump is a mechanical circulatory support device that can improve coronary artery perfusion and cardiac output in patients with cardiogenic shock. It reduces myocardial workload and increases coronary blood flow by inflating during diastole and deflating during systole. This device can be initiated while further diagnostic evaluation and management plans are being formulated.

Administering dobutamine (Answer A) or bisoprolol (Answer C) may be considered in select patients with cardiogenic shock and evidence of myocardial ischemia to increase myocardial contractility and decrease myocardial oxygen demand. However, the presence of an intracardiac mass and possible mechanical obstruction warrants further investigation and stabilization before initiating these medications.

Administering nitrates and nifedipine (Answer B) may be appropriate for patients with a suspected diagnosis of vasospastic angina, but not in this case where there is evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease and LV wall-motion abnormalities.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to start an intra-aortic balloon pump (Answer D) to provide temporary hemodynamic support while further evaluation and management are planned.

A: Perform vitreous tap and injection of intravitreal antibiotics

**Reasoning**:
The patient presents with a white macular lesion, disc edema, intraretinal and peripapillary hemorrhages, and mixed venous and arterial sheathing on fundus examination. These findings, along with the presence of cells on dilated fundus examination and residual epiretinal membrane on optical coherence tomography (OCT), suggest an intraocular infection or endophthalmitis as the cause of the patient's symptoms.

Performing a vitreous tap and injecting intravitreal antibiotics is an appropriate step to diagnose and treat possible endophthalmitis. This procedure allows for the sampling of vitreous fluid for microbiological analysis to identify the causative organism and determines the appropriate antibiotic therapy.

Reviewing medical records for the use of gentamicin intraoperatively may be a consideration, but it is not the next immediate step in managing the patient's symptoms.

Referring the patient to the emergency department for embolic stroke workup is not indicated based on the clinical presentation. The symptoms and findings described are more consistent with an intraocular infection rather than an embolic event.

Beginning valganciclovir hydrochloride therapy and sampling intraocular fluid for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for viral infection is not the next immediate step. There are no specific findings to suggest a viral etiology, and performing vitreous tap and intravitreal antibiotics is a more appropriate initial management strategy in this case.

B: Provide medical management with topical corticosteroids and hypertonic saline solution for an additional 3 months.

**Reasoning**:
The patient in this case presentation is an 82-year-old man with a history of blurred vision in the right eye after phacoemulsification cataract extraction. On examination, he has diffuse central corneal edema and folds in the right eye, with no remarkable findings in the left eye. The intraocular pressures are within normal range and the posterior chamber intraocular lens is in good position.

Given these findings, the most appropriate next step would be to provide medical management with topical corticosteroids and hypertonic saline solution for an additional 3 months. This conservative approach aims to reduce the corneal edema and promote the resolution of the condition. If there is no improvement with this treatment after 3 months, further interventions, such as endothelial keratoplasty, may be considered. However, it is important to start with conservative management before considering surgical options.

C) Peripheral blood smear and flow cytometry.

**Reasoning**:
The patient presented with acute unilateral painless vision loss, along with a history of purpuric rash on the hands and feet. The ophthalmic examination revealed frosted branch angiitis, which is characterized by preretinal hemorrhages, intraretinal hemorrhages, and perivascular exudates. These findings, along with the presence of medium vessel vasculitis on skin biopsy, suggest a systemic vasculitis affecting both the cutaneous and retinal vasculature.

Given the clinical presentation and findings, the next step would be to investigate the underlying cause of the vasculitis. Peripheral blood smear and flow cytometry can help identify any abnormal cells or markers that may be indicative of an underlying hematologic malignancy, such as leukemia or lymphoma, which can present with vasculitis.

Escalating systemic immunosuppression (A) may be considered as a treatment option in vasculitis, but it is important to establish the underlying cause before initiating or modifying the treatment regimen.

Diagnostic anterior chamber paracentesis and intravitreal foscarnet (B) may be appropriate in certain cases, such as when viral retinitis is suspected, but it is not the initial step in this case as there is no clear indication for viral retinitis based on the clinical presentation.

Whole-body positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) (D) is a useful imaging modality for staging and detecting metastatic disease, but it is not indicated as the initial step in this case. First, a peripheral blood smear and flow cytometry should be performed to investigate the underlying cause of the vasculitis.

Therefore, the appropriate next step in this case is to perform a peripheral blood smear and flow cytometry (C) to evaluate for underlying hematologic malignancy.

**Reasoning**: From the given clinical case, the patient is a young man with rapidly growing, asymptomatic skin nodules all over his body. The skin nodules are erythematous, indurated, and involve the head, neck, torso, and extremities. The nodules are not ulcerated or scarred. The systemic reviews are unremarkable and there is no lymphadenopathy or peripheral nerve enlargement. The complete blood cell count with differential is normal except for an elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase level.

Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the most likely diagnosis is Aleukemic cutaneous myeloid sarcoma (Option A). Aleukemic cutaneous myeloid sarcoma is a rare extramedullary manifestation of myeloid leukemia, characterized by the infiltration of immature myeloid cells in the skin and other extramedullary sites. It can present as multiple erythematous nodules or plaques, as seen in this case. The absence of ulceration or scarring and the sparing of the upper papillary dermis seen in the histologic findings are also consistent with cutaneous myeloid sarcoma.

Cutaneous lymphoma (Option B) is less likely in this case as the clinical presentation and histologic findings are not consistent with lymphoma. Lepromatous leprosy (Option C) is unlikely as the skin lesions in leprosy are typically hypopigmented and have a different histologic appearance. Sarcoidosis (Option D) is also less likely as it usually presents with granulomatous inflammation and is associated with hilar lymphadenopathy.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is Aleukemic cutaneous myeloid sarcoma (Option A).

B: Mammary analog secretory carcinoma

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation and histologic findings, the most likely diagnosis is mammary analog secretory carcinoma (MASC). MASC is a rare salivary gland neoplasm that resembles secretory carcinoma of the breast. 

The patient presented with a slowly enlarging left parotid mass with mild intermittent pain. Physical examination revealed a nonmobile, left parotid mass near the angle of the mandible with no overlying skin changes or drainage. There was no lymphadenopathy or other lesions in the neck area, and cranial nerve VII was fully intact.

Imaging studies showed a 1.5-cm preauricular nodular mass with internal and marginal vascularity. The histologic examination of the excised parotid mass demonstrated a multilobulated, complex lesion with prominent stromal fibrosis and collections of ductal structures with varying degrees of cystic change. Additionally, acinar cells with brightly eosinophilic intracytoplasmic granules were observed.

These findings are consistent with MASC, which typically presents as a well-circumscribed mass in the parotid gland. Histologically, it is characterized by nests and cords of tumor cells with eosinophilic or vacuolated cytoplasm, surrounded by fibrosis. The tumor cells also exhibit intracytoplasmic lumina containing eosinophilic secretory material.

Acinic cell carcinoma (choice A) typically presents as a painless mass in the parotid gland and histologically shows serous acinar cell differentiation without luminal secretory material.

Sclerosing polycystic adenoma (choice C) is a benign salivary gland tumor characterized by numerous cystic spaces surrounded by fibrous stroma. It does not typically exhibit the complex architecture or intracellular secretory material seen in the presented case.

Myoepithelial carcinoma (choice D) presents as a painless mass in the parotid gland and is histologically characterized by malignant proliferation of myoepithelial cells with various architectural patterns. It does not typically exhibit the cystic changes or eosinophilic secretory material seen in the presented case.

**Reasoning**: The patient presents with multiple tender perianal ulcers in the setting of immunosuppression after a kidney transplant. The ulcers have well-demarcated borders and are associated with thrombocytopenia and an elevated creatinine level. The histopathologic findings show enlarged fibroblasts and endothelial cells with glassy cytoplasm and intranuclear inclusions. These findings are consistent with cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. CMV infection is a common opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients and can present with gastrointestinal symptoms and cutaneous manifestations, including perianal ulcers. Amebiasis cutis typically presents with ulcerations in the gastrointestinal tract, but the patient's stool test results were negative for parasites. Herpes simplex virus infection can cause perianal ulcers, but the histopathologic findings are not consistent with viral cytopathic changes. Cutaneous Crohn disease can present with perianal involvement, but the histopathologic findings are different from what is observed in this patient's biopsy.

C: Lupus vulgaris.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation and histopathological findings, the most likely diagnosis is lupus vulgaris. Lupus vulgaris is a form of cutaneous tuberculosis that occurs as a result of hematogenous spread of Mycobacterium tuberculosis from a primary focus. It typically presents as a slowly progressive, painless, indurated plaque with a violaceous hue. The lesion enlarges slowly and can become ulcerated and secondarily infected, resulting in foul-smelling discharge, as seen in this case. The erythematous, indurated plaque partially covered with fine scale, along with the presence of noncaseating granulomatous dermatitis on biopsy, support the diagnosis of lupus vulgaris.

 18%|█▊        | 267/1525 [20:36<1:24:42,  4.04s/it]inside_gpt
**Reasoning**:

Based on the clinical presentation of the patient, there are several factors to consider. The initial diagnosis was presumed to be herpes zoster sine herpete with secondary bacterial infection, as indicated by the clinical presentation of a corneal ulcer, iris hemorrhages, and conjunctival ulceration. The patient was started on appropriate treatment with topical antibiotics and oral antivirals.

However, on day 6 of treatment, the patient developed a new larger epithelial defect and subepithelial bullae in an adjacent location without an infiltrate. Additionally, the patient exhibited dull conjunctival reflexes and bulbar conjunctival lesions bilaterally, along with patchy interpalpebral results on lissamine green staining of the conjunctiva and clinically significant punctate epithelial erosions of the cornea with fluorescein staining.

Given these new findings, it is important to consider other possible causes for the nonhealing epithelial defect and the ocular surface abnormalities seen in the patient. One possibility is ocular surface disease associated with autoimmune conditions such as Sjogren's syndrome. Anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies are commonly associated with Sjogren's syndrome and can be detected through serum testing.

Therefore, the next step would be to obtain serum anti-Ro and anti-La tests (Option C) to evaluate for the presence of an autoimmune condition that may be contributing to the patient's nonhealing epithelial defect and ocular surface abnormalities.
 18%|█▊        | 268/1525 [20:43<1:39:42,  4.76s/it]inside_gpt
C: Perform extraocular muscle biopsy.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the information provided, the patient presents with bilateral proptosis, conjunctival erythema, and enlargement of all extraocular muscles. These findings are suggestive of a condition known as thyroid eye disease (TED) or Graves' ophthalmopathy, which is commonly associated with autoimmune thyroid disease. However, the patient's thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI), and thyroid peroxidase antibody levels were normal, making Graves' disease less likely.

Given the patient's medical history of hematologic malignancies, it is important to consider alternative causes of bilateral extraocular muscle enlargement. In this case, the most appropriate next step would be to perform an extraocular muscle biopsy. A biopsy would help evaluate for infiltrative or neoplastic processes that may be causing the enlargement of the extraocular muscles.

The other answer choices (A, B, and D) are not indicated at this time. High-dose intravenous steroids (option A) are commonly used in the treatment of TED, but without a confirmed diagnosis, it would be premature to initiate treatment. Staged bilateral orbital decompressions (option B) and orbital external beam radiation (option D) may be considered later in the management of TED but are not appropriate as a first step before establishing a diagnosis.

D: Recommend a temporal craniotomy with a brain biopsy.

**Reasoning**:
The patient presented with worsening floaters, decreased visual acuity, and cystoid macular edema (CME) in both eyes. Additionally, there was leakage of the optic nerve and petaloid leakage in the macula on fluorescein angiography. These findings suggest an underlying systemic cause for the ocular manifestations. 

A uveitis workup was performed, but the results were unremarkable or negative. The patient also has a history of right-sided trigeminal neuralgia, and a brain MRI revealed an enhancing mass in the right middle cranial fossa, extending into the Meckel cave and abutting the right trigeminal nerve. 

Given the clinical findings of ocular inflammation, bilateral CME, optic nerve leakage, and the presence of an enhancing brain mass, a temporal craniotomy with a brain biopsy should be recommended. This procedure will help establish the diagnosis and guide further management. It is important to identify the underlying cause of the ocular manifestations to provide appropriate treatment and manage any potential systemic implications.

**Reasoning**: The patient presents with left periocular edema and erythema, along with retinal detachment noted on the fundus examination. The computed tomography scan also shows preseptal and periorbital soft tissue swelling and edema. Given these findings, it is important to perform an examination under anesthesia to evaluate the extent of the orbital swelling, assess the condition of the retinoblastoma tumor, and potentially consider further interventions or treatments.

A

**Reasoning:**
Based on the clinical presentation and biopsy findings, the most likely diagnosis in this case is Sweet syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis). Sweet syndrome is characterized by painful, red plaques or nodules that typically appear on the limbs, palms, and soles. It is often associated with fever and an elevated white blood cell count, particularly neutrophils. The histopathology findings of a neutrophilic infiltrate in the deeper dermis support this diagnosis. Urticaria would not typically present as tender plaques and would not show the same histopathologic findings. Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis is another possibility, but this condition usually presents with painful, erythematous nodules in a sporadic pattern. Leukemia cutis would typically present as infiltrative, firm papules or nodules and would not show the characteristic neutrophilic infiltrate seen in the biopsy.

C: Angioneurotic edema. 

**Reasoning**: 
Based on the clinical presentation, the patient's spontaneous bilateral neck swelling, the presence of edema in the lower lip, and the absence of traumatic or iatrogenic triggers, angioneurotic edema is a likely diagnosis. Angioneurotic edema is characterized by sudden onset of swelling in subcutaneous tissues, including the face, lips, tongue, and pharynx. It is often associated with allergic reactions, but can also be idiopathic. The absence of dyspnea or dysphagia suggests that the airway is not compromised, which is consistent with angioneurotic edema. 

The findings on the contrast-enhanced CT scan, such as the retropharyngeal fluid accumulation and infiltration of the mediastinal fat, are consistent with the involvement of deep subcutaneous tissues seen in angioneurotic edema. The absence of other signs such as cervical necrotizing fasciitis, lymphorrhea, or dental abnormality further supports the diagnosis of angioneurotic edema.

However, it is important to note that the final diagnosis should be confirmed with further evaluation, including laboratory tests and consideration of other possible causes.

D: Spontaneous airway hemorrhage with obstructive hematoma.

**Reasoning:**

Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is a spontaneous airway hemorrhage with obstructive hematoma. 

1. The patient's symptoms of dyspnea, dysphonia, dysphagia, and neck swelling are suggestive of upper airway obstruction.
2. The absence of fever, chills, neck stiffness, and otalgia make infectious causes, such as an abscess, less likely.
3. The patient's complex medical history, including anticoagulation therapy, suggests a possible bleeding disorder.
4. Laboratory studies show an elevated international normalized ratio (INR) and prolonged prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT), indicating poor coagulation function.
5. The computed tomography (CT) scan demonstrates a large obstructive submucosal lesion in the upper airway, extending from the nasopharynx to the glottis.
6. Flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy reveals a submucosal mass obstructing the view of the left supraglottis, glottis, and piriform sinus, with ecchymosis and edema on the right side of the epiglottis.
7. The visualization of the mass extending along the aryepiglottic fold, involving the arytenoid and interarytenoid space, and affecting the false vocal fold on the left suggests a hematoma.
8. Given the severity of the airway obstruction, awake fiberoptic nasotracheal intubation was performed to secure the patient's airway.

In summary, the patient's clinical presentation, complex medical history, laboratory findings, imaging results, and laryngoscopy findings are consistent with spontaneous airway hemorrhage with obstructive hematoma. Therefore, the correct answer is D: Spontaneous airway hemorrhage with obstructive hematoma.

B) Neurocristic hamartoma.

**Reasoning**: The presentation of a slow-growing, nontender plaque with hypertrichosis in a young child, along with the presence of other cutaneous findings such as dermal melanocytosis, blue-gray patches, and a café au lait macule, raises suspicion for a neurocristic hamartoma. Neurocristic hamartoma is a rare benign tumor that arises from the neural crest cells. It typically presents as a plaque with hypertrichosis and can be associated with other cutaneous findings such as café au lait macules and dermal melanocytosis. A biopsy of the lesion shows diffuse dermal infiltration of spindle cells and positive immunohistochemical staining for S100 in the mid to deep dermis, which is consistent with neurocristic hamartoma. Becker nevus is a localized hyperpigmented patch with or without hypertrichosis that typically presents in adolescence. Smooth muscle hamartoma presents as a plaque with a cobblestone appearance and has no associated hair growth abnormalities. Plexiform neurofibroma presents as a soft, fleshy, and often pedunculated mass in the dermis or subcutaneous tissue, and is associated with neurofibromatosis type 1.

C) Right heart catheterization for biopsy.

**Reasoning**:
Given the patient's clinical presentation of progressive shortness of breath, productive cough, fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, palpitations, chest discomfort, and lower-extremity swelling, along with the findings of an irregular heart rate, bilateral crackles, and pulmonary embolism on imaging, there is a high suspicion for malignancy as the cause of the right atrial mass.

Right heart catheterization with biopsy would be the next appropriate step to obtain a tissue sample for definitive diagnosis. This procedure allows for direct visualization of the right atrium and sampling of the mass. It can help differentiate between primary cardiac tumors and metastatic tumors, as well as determine the extent of involvement and potential treatment options.

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) can provide additional information about the nature and extent of the mass, but they do not provide tissue samples for diagnosis. These imaging modalities may be used as adjunctive tests after a biopsy has been performed.

Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is a useful imaging modality for assessing intracardiac masses, but it may not provide enough information to reach a definitive diagnosis in this case. TEE can be considered as a complementary test following the biopsy to further evaluate the characteristics and location of the mass.

In summary, right heart catheterization for biopsy would be the most appropriate next step in order to obtain a tissue sample for diagnosis.

B: Order antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, and complement levels

**Reasoning:**

This patient presented with a purpuric rash on his right foot, along with fever, diaphoresis, and headaches. The rash appeared after a history of a fall and fractures in the same area. The presence of nontender, nonpalpable purpura, along with scattered petechiae, suggests a possible vasculitic process. Vasculitis can be seen in various systemic diseases, including autoimmune conditions.

Given the clinical presentation, it would be important to rule out autoimmune diseases by ordering antinuclear antibody (ANA), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), and complement levels. These tests can help determine if an autoimmune process is responsible for the purpuric rash and other symptoms. Lower extremity duplex ultrasound, option C, might be useful to evaluate for any vascular abnormalities or clot formation, but it seems less likely in this case.

A skin biopsy, option A, could be considered if other initial laboratory tests are inconclusive or if there is a need for further histological evaluation of the rash to determine its specific etiology. However, in this case, ordering the autoimmune tests would be a reasonable initial step to investigate the possibility of an autoimmune vasculitis.

Without further information suggesting an infectious etiology, such as leukocytosis or evidence of an active infection, ordering antibiotic therapy, option D, would not be the most appropriate next step. Thus, option B is the most appropriate next step in the evaluation of this patient.

C: Order computed tomography (CT) scan of abdomen and pelvis

**Reasoning**:
Based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, she has been experiencing dorsal foot lesions for 18 months. The lesions started as small papules and gradually spread across the dorsum of her feet. Despite treatment with topical salicylic acid and cryotherapy, the lesions did not improve. The patient also reports foot pain that worsens with topical pressure or wrapping.

Given the chronic nature of the lesions, the lack of improvement with previous treatments, and the presence of foot pain, further evaluation is warranted. Ordering a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis would be the next step to assess for any underlying systemic condition that could be contributing to the foot lesions and pain. The CT scan may help identify any potential internal organ involvement or systemic disease processes that could be causing the symptoms.

Therefore, the appropriate next step would be to order a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis (Option C).

B: Order cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing for Alzheimer disease biomarkers.

**Reasoning**:

In this case, the patient is a 64-year-old man presenting with concerns about an abnormal genetic test result for APOE. He reports forgetfulness and word-finding difficulties for 3 years but is generally healthy, with normal physical examination and brain imaging results. The patient has a family history of dementia in his father and maternal great aunt. The genetic testing for APOE indicates that Alzheimer's disease may be the cause or a contributor to the observed dementia.

Given the patient's symptoms, family history, and the genetic test result, further diagnostic testing is warranted to assess the patient's risk and to determine if Alzheimer's disease is present. CSF testing for Alzheimer disease biomarkers can provide additional information to support the diagnosis. Biomarkers such as amyloid-beta protein, tau protein, and phosphorylated tau can help identify the presence of Alzheimer's disease pathology.

Although a brain fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan can provide information on brain metabolism, it is not the next best step in this case. FDG-PET scans primarily assess brain function and are not specific for Alzheimer's disease.

Reassurance and follow-up in 1 year may not be appropriate given the patient's symptoms and genetic test result. A proactive approach in assessing the patient's risk and providing appropriate management is necessary.

Referral for genetic counseling may be considered to provide the patient with additional information and support. However, given the patient's symptoms and concern about the genetic test result, further diagnostic testing is still needed before considering genetic counseling.

Therefore, the next best step would be to order cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing for Alzheimer disease biomarkers to evaluate the patient's risk and determine the presence of Alzheimer's disease pathology.

B) Order neuroimaging with magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits with and without contrast.

**Reasoning**: The patient's presentation of bilateral ptosis and ophthalmoparesis requires further evaluation to determine the underlying cause. While surgical repair of ptosis with a frontalis sling may be a treatment option, it is important to identify the underlying etiology before proceeding with surgery.

Thyroid eye disease (choice D) could be a consideration, as it can cause bilateral ophthalmoparesis. However, this patient's lack of other symptoms such as fatigue, generalized muscle weakness or neurologic deficits, and the absence of eyelid retraction or other characteristic signs of thyroid eye disease make it less likely as the primary cause.

Cardiac abnormalities (choice C) are not typically associated with the symptoms described in this patient, so an electrocardiogram is unlikely to provide useful information in this context.

Given the progressive onset of symptoms and the absence of any known trauma or other causative factors, neuroimaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits is the appropriate next step. This will help evaluate for any structural abnormalities, such as tumors or inflammation, that may be causing the ptosis and ophthalmoparesis. The use of contrast can help improve visualization and detection of any pathology.

Therefore, ordering neuroimaging with magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits with and without contrast is the most appropriate next step in the evaluation of this patient's bilateral ptosis and ophthalmoparesis.

A: Lumbar puncture 

**Reasoning**: In this case, the 4-year-old girl has presented with symptoms of fever, ear pain, headache, vomiting, and bilateral optic disc swelling with obscuration of all borders and a peripapillary halo. The imaging studies revealed sigmoid sinus thrombosis and bilateral confluent mastoiditis. These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of mastoiditis with intracranial complications, such as meningitis and venous sinus thrombosis.

To confirm the diagnosis of meningitis, a lumbar puncture should be performed to obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for analysis. CSF analysis will help determine if there are any signs of infection, such as elevated white blood cell count and protein levels, as well as the presence of bacteria or other pathogens. This information is crucial for the appropriate management of the patient, including the choice of antibiotics and duration of treatment.

Initiation of anticoagulation (B) may be considered if there is evidence of venous sinus thrombosis, but this should be based on the results of imaging studies and confirmation of the diagnosis. It is important to first obtain CSF analysis to rule out meningitis, as the presentation of these two conditions can overlap.

Ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement (C) is not indicated in this case, as there are no signs or symptoms of increased intracranial pressure or hydrocephalus mentioned in the case.

High-dose intravenous steroids (D) are not indicated in the initial management of this patient. Steroids may be considered in certain cases of bacterial meningitis to reduce inflammation and complications, but they should not be the initial step in the management of this patient.

Therefore, the next step in this case would be to perform a lumbar puncture (A) to evaluate for meningitis and guide further management.

A: Brain or kidney biopsy.

**Reasoning**:

Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the patient is a 35-year-old man with a history of painless vision decrease in both eyes, hypertension, family history of kidney failure, and cognitive impairment. The ophthalmic examination showed retinal vasculitis, and the enhanced brain MRI showed diffuse white matter hyperintensities with multiple ring-enhancing lesions. Routine blood tests revealed kidney insufficiency with proteinuria. The CSF analysis was normal. 

Given the symptoms, neuroimaging findings, and kidney insufficiency, the next step would be to perform a brain or kidney biopsy. These types of biopsies can help in diagnosing the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and findings, such as investigating for vasculitis or identifying any specific genetic mutations that may be contributing to the presentation.

Genetic sequencing may be considered as a possible diagnostic step, but it would not be the first-line choice in this case. Second CSF culture and aqueous humor paracentesis may not provide relevant information for the current clinical presentation.

A: Discuss superficial keratectomy to confirm the diagnosis by histopathologic examination.

**Reasoning**: The patient is presenting with a cloudy cornea and progressive blurring of vision. The slitlamp examination reveals a grayish corneal opacity that extends into the visual axis. The lesion appears to involve the corneal epithelium but not the stroma, as indicated by anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT). These findings are concerning for an epithelial lesion. Superficial keratectomy, which involves removing the superficial layers of the cornea, can help confirm the diagnosis by obtaining a histopathologic examination of the lesion. This will provide more information about the nature of the lesion and guide further management.

**Reasoning**: In this case, the patient presents with a 1-month history of crusted lesions with purulent drainage on the scalp, along with pruritus and pain. The patient has a history of actinic damage and male pattern baldness, which are important clues. The multiple thick, yellow-brown crusts overlying erosions with purulent drainage suggest an infectious etiology.

A. Folliculitis decalvans: This is a chronic suppurative folliculitis that primarily affects the scalp, leading to permanent hair loss. It is characterized by tufted hairs and perifollicular erythema. While folliculitis decalvans can present with crusted lesions and purulent drainage, it typically causes more localized hair loss rather than diffuse involvement seen in the patient's case. Therefore, this is an unlikely diagnosis.

B. Squamous cell carcinoma: Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a type of skin cancer that typically presents as a persistent, growing, and scaly lesion on sun-exposed areas. It may be associated with actinic keratoses. However, the clinical presentation of thick, yellow-brown crusts overlying erosions with purulent drainage is not typical for SCC. In addition, the patient denies previous skin cancer, making SCC less likely in this case.

C. Erosive pustular dermatosis: Erosive pustular dermatosis (EPD) is a rare condition characterized by sterile pustules, erosions, and crusted lesions most commonly occurring on the lower extremities. While EPD can occur on the scalp, it is typically associated with lower extremity involvement. The presentation in this case, with lesions primarily on the scalp and a history of actinic damage, is not consistent with EPD.

D. Pemphigus foliaceus: Pemphigus foliaceus is an autoimmune blistering disorder characterized by superficial erosions and fragile blisters. Patients may present with crusted skin lesions. However, the presence of purulent drainage and positive wound culture for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus suggests a secondary infection rather than an autoimmune etiology. Therefore, pemphigus foliaceus is an unlikely diagnosis.

Based on the clinical presentation of diffuse actinic damage, multiple thick, yellow-brown crusts with erosions and purulent drainage on the scalp, and positive wound culture for methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, the most likely diagnosis in this case is **Folliculitis decalvans** (A).

C: Kallmann syndrome

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation of the patient, with a complaint of olfactory disorder since birth, along with other associated features such as laryngeal tracheoesophageal fissure, intestinal hernia, hearing loss, and atrophic olfactory bulbs detected on MRI, the most likely diagnosis is Kallmann syndrome. 

Kallmann syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (delayed or absent puberty) and anosmia (inability to smell). In this case, the patient's olfactory disorder since birth, along with the presence of atrophic olfactory bulbs seen on MRI, are consistent with Kallmann syndrome. Additionally, the patient's lack of menarche and the presence of vaginal defects and uterine rudiments seen on MRI suggest an associated Mullerian duct anomaly, further supporting the diagnosis of Kallmann syndrome.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: Kallmann syndrome.

Based on the clinical presentation and histopathological findings, the most likely diagnosis is Eosinophilic annular erythema (B). The patient presented with annular plaques that were erythematous and pruritic, which is characteristic of this condition. The histopathological findings of perivascular and interstitial inflammation with numerous scattered eosinophils further support this diagnosis. Erythema annulare centrifugum (A) typically presents with expanding erythematous rings without scale, but it is not associated with eosinophils. Granuloma annulare (C) is characterized by annular plaques with central clearing, whereas the patient's lesions showed no central clearing. Drug-induced bullous pemphigoid (D) typically presents with tense bullae and is not consistent with the clinical presentation described.

D) Marginal zone lymphoma.

**Reasoning**: 

1. The patient presented with gradual enlargement of lesions on the face, chest, back, and arms over the past year, which is consistent with the infiltrative plaques and nodules seen on physical examination. This suggests a cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorder.
2. The presence of leonine facies, madarosis (loss of eyebrow hair), and an eschar on the nasal dorsum are characteristic findings of advanced cutaneous lymphoma.
3. The patient also had palpable cervical and axillary lymph nodes, which indicates lymph node involvement.
4. Laboratory investigation revealed marked leukocytosis with a high percentage of lymphocytes, indicating lymphoproliferative disease.
5. Imaging studies showed multiple enlarged lymph nodes in the mediastinal, axillary, subpectoral, abdominopelvic, and inguinal regions, as well as small pulmonary nodules.
6. The histopathologic images showed a dense diffuse dermal lymphoid infiltrate composed of small to medium cells with irregular nuclear contours, which is consistent with marginal zone lymphoma.
7. Immunohistochemistry showed diffusely positive cyclin D1 staining, which is a characteristic finding of marginal zone lymphoma.

Based on the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, imaging studies, and histopathology results, the most likely diagnosis is Marginal zone lymphoma.

D) Implant a dual-chamber permanent pacemaker. 

**Reasoning**:
Based on the patient's clinical presentation of complete heart block (CHB) with a narrow QRS junctional escape rhythm, the next step would be to implant a permanent pacemaker. The patient's symptoms of palpitations, dizziness, and lightheadedness, along with the progression of the junctional rhythm to a slow escape rhythm, indicate the need for intervention with a pacemaker. Temporary pacemakers may be used initially to stabilize the patient, but a permanent pacemaker is the definitive treatment for CHB. In this case, there is no indication for corticosteroids or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). Antibiotic treatment with ceftriaxone is not indicated given the absence of evidence for bacterial infection.

**Reasoning**:

Based on the clinical features described in the case, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is Rett syndrome.

Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder that primarily affects females. It is characterized by normal development in the first 6-18 months of life, followed by a period of regression, loss of acquired skills, and the development of motor and cognitive impairments.

The patient in this case presented with normal development in infancy but started experiencing delayed motor and language milestones at around 2 years of age. This is consistent with the regression phase seen in Rett syndrome.

Other features of Rett syndrome include microcephaly, short stature, intellectual disability, severe scoliosis, gait abnormalities, sleep apnea, constipation, and hand stereotypies. The patient in this case exhibited many of these features, including a severe degree of scoliosis and the need for a wheelchair at age 18.

Additionally, the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a reduction in the corpus callosum, a characteristic finding in Rett syndrome.

Turner syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by a missing or partially missing X chromosome, resulting in short stature, delayed puberty, and other physical abnormalities. Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder that causes intellectual disability, behavioral and learning challenges, and physical characteristics similar to Rett syndrome, but it is typically seen in males and can be passed on by carrier females. Cerebral palsy is a group of neurological disorders that affect movement, muscle tone, and posture, usually present from early childhood.

Considering the clinical features described and the specific findings on MRI, the most appropriate diagnosis for this patient is Rett syndrome.

A) Check levels of serum protein, albumin, prealbumin, and other nutritional laboratory measures.

**Reasoning**:
The patient presents with widespread edema, acute dermatitis, and a history of poor growth. These symptoms raise suspicion for a possible nutritional deficiency, such as protein deficiency. Checking levels of serum protein, such as albumin and prealbumin, as well as other nutritional laboratory measures can help determine if there is a nutritional deficiency as the underlying cause for the symptoms. This will provide important information for further evaluation and management of the patient.

C: Start empirical intravenous antibiotics

**Reasoning**:
Based on the patient's presentation, including the presence of dizziness, chest pain, rash, nail changes, neurological deficits, and laboratory findings (elevated troponin level), there is suspicion for an infectious cause.

The patient's symptoms and physical findings, such as the painful rash on the left foot, tenderness of the fingers and toes, splinter hemorrhages on the thumb, and petechial macules on the palms and soles, are suggestive of an infectious etiology.

Given the presence of stroke-like symptoms (acute infarcts in the right cerebellum), elevated troponin level (indicating cardiac involvement), and T-wave inversions on the electrocardiogram consistent with a non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction, endocarditis should be considered as a possible diagnosis.

In cases of suspected endocarditis, empiric intravenous antibiotics should be initiated promptly to cover for both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. Blood cultures should also be obtained to guide targeted antibiotic therapy.

Performing a skin biopsy, administering tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), or pursuing surgical evaluation would not be appropriate at this stage without further diagnostic workup to confirm the diagnosis of endocarditis.

B: Schedule an orbital computed tomography scan.

**Reasoning**: The child has a recurrent subconjunctival hemorrhage and a large inferior orbital mass. To further evaluate the orbital mass and determine its characteristics, an orbital computed tomography (CT) scan should be performed. The CT scan will provide detailed imaging of the mass, helping to identify its location, size, and any associated abnormalities. This information will be essential in guiding the next steps of management. Aspirating the orbital lesion without proper imaging guidance could be risky and may not provide sufficient diagnostic information. Examining the abdomen during the EUA is not indicated based on the clinical presentation. Referring the child for a biopsy should be based on the findings of the CT scan.

D) Perform an anterior orbitotomy with abscess drainage in conjunction with endoscopic sinus surgery.

**Reasoning**:
The patient presents with progressive eyelid swelling, pain, and a palpable fluctuant mass over the right orbit, which is tender to palpation. Computed tomography (CT) imaging reveals a right supraorbital abscess with mass effect on the right globe and communication with the frontal sinus. The presence of advanced dental caries communicating with the maxillary sinus suggests a possible source of infection. Given the clinical findings and imaging, the most appropriate next step would be to perform an anterior orbitotomy to drain the abscess and address any underlying sinus pathology through endoscopic sinus surgery. This will allow for adequate drainage of the abscess and removal of any source of infection, ultimately leading to symptom resolution. Therefore, the correct answer is D) Perform an anterior orbitotomy with abscess drainage in conjunction with endoscopic sinus surgery.

**Reasoning**: The patient presents with persistent redness and discomfort in the left eye, which is unresponsive to topical treatment. The raised intraocular pressure (IOP) and the presence of dilated and tortuous bulbar blood vessels suggest an underlying systemic condition that needs to be investigated further. The patient also reports a 2-month history of left-sided dull headache and an annoying "whooshing" noise in the left ear, which may indicate a neurologic involvement. Therefore, it is important to perform additional tests such as chest radiography, urinalysis, blood tests, and potentially other studies to rule out any underlying systemic disease. Additionally, prescribing an oral NSAID and/or systemic immunosuppression (oral corticosteroid) may help with the management of the patient's symptoms.

B) Obtain computed tomographic scan of the orbits.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation of a 2-year-old girl with acute eyelid edema and proptosis, and the findings on physical examination and MRI of the orbits, the next step should be to obtain a computed tomographic (CT) scan of the orbits.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as upper eyelid fullness, axial proptosis, and left intraconal mass on MRI, suggest the presence of an orbital mass causing the symptoms. A CT scan of the orbits would provide additional information about the size, location, and characteristics of the mass, which is important for further evaluation and management.

Performing a biopsy (C) without obtaining a CT scan first would not be ideal as it may not provide all the necessary information about the mass, such as its exact location and extent. Starting treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy (D) without confirming the diagnosis and understanding the characteristics of the mass would also not be appropriate.

Therefore, obtaining a computed tomographic scan of the orbits (B) would be the next appropriate step in the management of this patient.

**Reasoning**: Based on the provided case description and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is an ameloblastoma. 

1. The patient presented with a 3-month history of right-sided maxillary pain and swelling, which has worsened over the past several weeks. This is consistent with the slow-growing nature of ameloblastomas.
2. The physical examination revealed intraoral swelling involving the buccal and palatal aspects of the posterior maxilla. Ameloblastomas commonly present as expansile, painless swellings.
3. Computed tomography (CT) imaging demonstrated a relatively spherical 4-cm growth of the right anterior maxilla abutting the maxillary sinus and orbital floors. This pattern of growth is consistent with the locally aggressive nature of ameloblastomas.
4. The biopsy results showed a thickly encapsulated proliferation of odontogenic epithelial cells with pseudoglandular elements, which is characteristic of ameloblastomas.
5. The treatment involved complete removal of the maxillary lesion, which is the standard approach for ameloblastoma management.

Therefore, the most appropriate diagnosis for this case is ameloblastoma (C).

Reasoning: The woman in her late 40s presented with rapidly progressive redness and stiffness of both hands, along with finger joint and shoulder pain. Results of autoimmune serology tests were negative, ruling out conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus.

This patient has a history of recurrent endocarditis and severe mitral regurgitation. Her transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiograms demonstrate elevated mean MV gradients and she is experiencing symptoms of exertional dyspnea. Additionally, her previous MV repair with annuloplasty has not resolved the persistent marked mitral regurgitation. Given her desire to continue the pregnancy and her declining termination, the most appropriate next step would be to perform surgical MV replacement. This would address the underlying structural abnormalities of the mitral valve and provide relief of symptoms. Balloon mitral valvuloplasty and transcatheter MV-in-ring procedure would not be appropriate in this case, as the patient has a history of endocarditis and recurrent mitral regurgitation. Medical management with metoprolol and enoxaparin may be considered adjunctively, but would not address the underlying structural issues and would not be sufficient as the primary treatment option.

**Reasoning**: The patient's presentation of painless neck swelling, associated with fever and sore throat, along with the physical examination findings of minimally tender and nonmobile submandibular swelling, are suggestive of lymphadenopathy. Laboratory findings of leukocytosis with neutrophilia, anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and elevated C-reactive protein level further support an inflammatory process. Ultrasonography revealing multiple enlarged lymph nodes with interval enlargement and loss of internal architecture, along with the patient's weight loss and the presence of lytic foci on FDG PET/CT, suggest a malignant process. The MRI findings of extensive unilateral neck adenopathy and involvement of other sites (left maxillary malar eminence, T4 vertebra, and upper sternum) are concerning for lymphoma. Langerhans cell histiocytosis and Rosai-Dorfman disease are both non-malignant conditions that can present with lymphadenopathy, but they do not typically demonstrate lytic bone lesions or destructive masses as seen in this case. Neuroblastoma typically presents in young children with a palpable abdominal mass and does not commonly involve the lymph nodes or bone.

**Reasoning**:
The patient developed a dry cough after starting crizotinib therapy. Chest radiography showed a new consolidation lesion over the right upper lobe, raising suspicion of disease recurrence. However, the absence of fever or purulent sputum, along with the decrease in tumor marker levels, suggests that an infectious process is less likely. Additionally, there is no evidence of pneumonia on the mycobacterial and bacteriologic surveys. Since the clinical presentation is atypical for recurrence, it would be prudent to perform a biopsy for histological confirmation. This would help differentiate between recurrence and other benign causes, such as granulomatous inflammation.

**Reasoning**:
The clinical presentation of a newborn with unilateral exophthalmos (bulging of the eye) and a rapidly growing parotid mass suggests a malignant tumor. The elevated intraocular pressure, swollen eye with a foggy cornea, and conjunctival vascular anomaly indicate ocular involvement. The ocular B-scan ultrasonography showing a large subretinal lesion with multiple intralesional, hyperechoic foci is consistent with retinoblastoma, a malignant tumor arising from the retina. Additionally, the results of the 18F-fludeoxyglucose–positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) showing hypermetabolic masses at the posterior aspect of the right globe support the diagnosis of retinoblastoma. The loss of INI-1 observed in the pathological specimen from the parotid gland is a characteristic finding in retinoblastoma. Medulloepithelioma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor are less likely given the specific features described in the case.

C: Perform treadmill stress testing for evaluation of inherited arrhythmias.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the provided information, the patient has a history of heroin use, presented with syncope, and experienced a run of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. The initial workup including troponin levels, thyroid levels, complete blood cell count, metabolic panel, and imaging studies came back normal. 

Given the patient's age and the absence of any significant findings on initial workup, it is important to consider other potential causes for the syncope and ventricular tachycardia. Inherited arrhythmias, such as long QT syndrome, are one such possibility. These conditions can be unmasked by exercise or stress, which is why treadmill stress testing is recommended.

Starting amiodarone or implanting an internal implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) at this stage would be premature, as further evaluation is needed to confirm the diagnosis. Sending blood tests for drug levels would be appropriate if there was suspicion of drug intoxication, but the urine toxicology test was already negative. Therefore, the next appropriate step would be to perform treadmill stress testing for evaluation of inherited arrhythmias.

C: Monitor closely with serial examinations and repeated visual field testing. 

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation and examination findings, the patient is a 52-year-old woman with bilateral visual field defects, a history of open-angle glaucoma, and persistent visual field deterioration despite adequate intraocular pressure (IOP) control. The visual acuities are relatively preserved, and there are no significant abnormalities on slit-lamp examination or fundus examination, other than small, tilted discs without pallor or hyperemia. The optic disc photographs also show peripapillary atrophy without other signs of optic nerve damage.
Given these findings, the most appropriate next step would be to monitor the patient closely with serial examinations and repeated visual field testing. This will help to assess the stability or progression of the visual field defects over time. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not indicated in this case since there are no signs or symptoms suggestive of a compressive lesion or other intracranial pathology. Trabeculectomy may be considered in cases of uncontrolled glaucoma or progressive visual field loss despite maximum medical therapy, but the patient's IOP is well-controlled and there is no evidence of active glaucomatous optic neuropathy at this time. Reassurance that the findings are consistent with a longstanding congential defect would not be appropriate as there are no features to suggest a congenital defect and the patient's symptoms and visual field loss are recent. Thus, the most appropriate next step is to monitor the patient closely with serial examinations and repeated visual field testing to evaluate for any progression or changes in the visual field defects.

C: Scalp metastasis 

**Reasoning**:

Based on the clinical presentation, the patient has a solitary, asymptomatic lump on the scalp that has been present since birth but showed growth following a minor trauma. There is no local inflammation or systemic symptoms reported, and the patient denies any discharge. Dermoscopic evaluation showed a homogeneous yellow hue with no visible vascular or pigmented structures.

The lesion itself is described as an ill-defined, infiltrated plaque with a normochromic, exophytic nodule on the scalp vertex, with a waxy surface, irregular transverse furrows, and overlying alopecia. It is also firm and mildly tender to the touch.

The patient's medical history is notable for a benign breast nodule resection in her teenage years, and her father died of metastatic cutaneous melanoma.

In the pathology report, cellular infiltration in the reticular dermis and monomorphic cells in a syncytial configuration surrounding collagen bundles are observed.

Given the clinical presentation, the history of a benign breast nodule and a family history of cutaneous melanoma, and the findings on pathology, the most likely diagnosis is scalp metastasis.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation and history provided in the case, the patient has bilateral vascular lesions visible beneath the palpebral conjunctiva on the upper and lower eyelids. These lesions have been present for 15 years and are associated with the patient's history of bulimia and purging. The patient reports a reduction in the size and pressure of these lesions with respite from daily episodes of purging.

Given the chronicity of the lesions and the relief with reduction in purging episodes, it is most likely that these vascular lesions are related to the patient's purging behavior. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to observe the periocular lesions while psychiatric treatment is continued. This approach allows for monitoring of the lesions for any changes and provides an opportunity for the patient to address their underlying bulimia through ongoing psychiatric treatment.

Sclerotherapy and surgical excision are not necessary in this case as the lesions are likely secondary to the patient's purging behavior and may improve with resolution of the underlying bulimia. Initiation of systemic administration of propranolol is not indicated as the patient does not have any signs or symptoms of excessive sympathetic activity or hemodynamic compromise. Therefore, the best course of action is to observe the periocular lesions while psychiatric treatment is continued.

C: Administer intralesional fluorouracil.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the description and examination findings, the patient presents with a mass in the left upper eyelid that is causing swelling and thickening. The MRI reveals focal enhancement in the left upper eyelid, suggesting an epithelial tumor. The amelanotic appearance and hairpin-shaped vascular pattern of the mass further support this suspicion.

Intralesional fluorouracil is a treatment option for certain types of epithelial tumors, such as ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN). It can be effective in reducing the size of the tumor and promoting regression. Topical interferon alfa-2b is another possible treatment option for OSSN, but it is not the first-line choice in this case.

External beam radiotherapy may be considered as a treatment modality for certain types of tumors, but it is not typically the initial step in the management of an eyelid mass.

Performing a complete posterior lamellar resection may be a viable treatment option in some cases, but it is a more invasive procedure and would not be the first choice without further investigation and confirmation of the diagnosis.

Therefore, given the clinical presentation and possible diagnosis of an epithelial tumor, administering intralesional fluorouracil would be the appropriate next step in the management of this patient.

B: Eosinophilic dermatosis of hematologic malignancy

**Reasoning**:
Based on the presentation of a pruritic and generalized cutaneous eruption in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia (subtype M5a), the history, physical examination, and biopsy findings suggest a diagnosis of eosinophilic dermatosis of hematologic malignancy. The patient's recent diagnosis of leukemia, absence of fever, malaise, and insect bites, and lack of new drug treatments suggest that the eruption is not a drug reaction (choice A). The presence of indurated and edematous papules and plaques, along with the histologic findings of a perivascular and interstitial mononuclear infiltrate with numerous eosinophils, is consistent with eosinophilic dermatosis of hematologic malignancy. Urticarial vasculitis (choice C) typically presents with palpable purpura, whereas urticarial bullous pemphigoid (choice D) is a blistering disorder that would not manifest with the described clinical features.

A: Observe the patient without intervention.

**Reasoning**: The patient presented with a 2-week history of headache, photophobia, vomiting, and confusion. The examination findings showed somnolence and confusion without focal neurologic deficits. The imaging findings, including ventriculomegaly and cerebral edema, suggest hydrocephalus. The CSF analysis showed no significant abnormalities. The sudden decrease in intracranial pressure and CSF drainage, along with the change in location of the nonenhancing lesion on repeat MRI, are suggestive of a transient obstruction. Given the absence of severe symptoms or evidence of infection, observation without intervention would be appropriate at this time.

B) Order radiographs of hands and feet. 

**Reasoning**: In this case, the patient presents with dyschromic (discolored) nails, exertional dyspnea, and lower extremity edema. The yellow discoloration and thickening of the nails along with distal onycholysis (separation of the nail from the nail bed) suggest a possible fungal infection of the nails. Performing microscopy of nail scrapings after keratolysis with potassium hydroxide solution will help confirm the presence of a fungal infection.

However, the patient also has exertional dyspnea and lower extremity edema, which could be indicative of underlying cardiopulmonary disease. It is important to assess for potential cardiopulmonary causes by ordering radiographs of the hands and feet. This can help evaluate for signs of cardiolymphatic congestion, which may indicate heart failure or other cardiac abnormalities.

While a thoracic CT scan could provide more detailed imaging of the chest and lungs, it would not directly address the nail and lower extremity findings. Similarly, measuring serum ferritin, serum iron, and serum total iron-binding capacity would not provide relevant information in this case. Therefore, the next appropriate step would be to order radiographs of the hands and feet to evaluate for cardiopulmonary causes of the patient's symptoms.

C) Ileal metastasis

**Reasoning**:
The patient has metastatic appendiceal adenocarcinoma and is undergoing chemotherapy with capecitabine plus oxaliplatin. He presents with lower abdominal pain and watery, large-volume diarrhea. The diarrhea is nonbloody, occurs up to 15 times per day, and wakes him up from sleep. It is accompanied by crampy abdominal pain and is not associated with nausea or vomiting. The diarrhea has not responded to treatment with various anti-diarrheal medications and required intravenous fluid and electrolyte repletion. The physical examination reveals a mildly tender abdomen with hyperactive bowel sounds, but no peritoneal signs. Laboratory workup shows severe hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, as well as positive fecal lactoferrin and elevated fecal calprotectin levels. A CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis reveals diffuse long-segment wall thickening involving nearly the entire terminal ileum. Colonoscopy reveals erythematous and congested mucosa with scattered erosions and ulcerations in the terminal ileum.

The clinical presentation, radiological findings, and endoscopic findings suggest the presence of metastatic disease involving the terminal ileum. This is the most likely cause of the patient's watery diarrhea. Therefore, the correct diagnosis is ileal metastasis (Answer C).

A: Refer to a retina specialist owing to retinal thinning.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the patient's history and examination, there are several findings that suggest optic nerve and retinal involvement. The patient has a history of chronic angle-closure glaucoma and bilateral peripheral iridotomies, which would not typically cause asymmetrical cup-disc ratios, pallor of the optic nerve, and decreased color vision. The optic nerve findings, along with the visual field defects and ganglion cell layer thinning seen on the optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans, suggest optic nerve damage and retinal involvement.

Therefore, the next appropriate step would be to refer the patient to a retina specialist for further evaluation and management. They would be able to assess the extent of the retinal thinning, determine the cause of the optic nerve damage, and recommend appropriate treatment options. Starting intraocular pressure-lowering medications based on ganglion cell layer (GCL) loss alone would not address the underlying cause of the visual symptoms and could potentially delay proper management. Ordering a carotid Doppler or brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be considered in certain cases, but given the clinical presentation, retinal thinning appears to be the most likely cause, making referral to a retina specialist the most appropriate next step.

C) Provide systemic corticosteroids and outpatient follow-up.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the patient is likely experiencing scleritis and retinal detachment following strabismus surgery. Scleritis is an inflammatory condition involving the sclera, which can lead to scleral thinning and subsequent complications such as retinal detachment. In this case, the patient has severe pain, redness, scleral thinning, anterior chamber inflammation, and neovascularization, all consistent with scleritis.

The initial management of scleritis involves systemic corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and prevent progression of the condition. Topical steroids alone may not be sufficient to control the inflammation in this case, given the severity of the symptoms. Therefore, systemic corticosteroids are indicated.

Admission may not be necessary if the patient's pain is controlled, there are no signs of systemic infection or complications, and the patient can comply with follow-up visits. Therefore, in this case, providing systemic corticosteroids and scheduling outpatient follow-up would be the most appropriate step.

B) Ameloblastoma

**Reasoning**:
1. The patient presented with an impacted mandibular canine tooth, which is a finding commonly associated with ameloblastoma.
2. The dental cone beam computed tomography (CT) scan revealed a large radiolucent mandibular lesion with an unerupted mandibular canine in the center of the lesion. This is consistent with the characteristic appearance of an ameloblastoma on imaging.
3. The histological sections from the resection demonstrated nests and cords of polygonal cells with clear to eosinophilic cytoplasm embedded in a dense collagenous stroma. This histological appearance is consistent with ameloblastoma.
4. Perineural invasion was identified, which is a feature often seen in ameloblastoma.
5. Immunohistochemistry findings revealed the tumor cells were positive for p40, which is a marker commonly used to differentiate ameloblastoma from other odontogenic tumors.
6. Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies demonstrated an EWSR1 gene rearrangement in 60% of the tumor cells, which is consistent with the genetic alterations seen in ameloblastoma.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation, imaging findings, histology, and genetic alterations, the most likely diagnosis is ameloblastoma (B).

C: Pigmented extramammary Paget disease.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation of an enlarged and variegated plaque in the axilla, which started as a small eczematous, pink-to-brown plaque and recently changed to a dark brown color, the possibility of a pigmented lesion is high.

Pagetoid Bowen disease is a type of squamous cell carcinoma in situ that typically presents as a thin, scaly, red plaque, and does not usually involve pigmentation.

Inverse lichen planus is a variant of lichen planus that affects areas with skin folds, causing symmetrical plaques with a shiny, violaceous appearance, but it does not typically present with pigmentation.

Superficial spreading melanoma is a type of melanoma characterized by irregularly pigmented macules or plaques that evolve over time, but it is less likely in this case, as the lesion is described as slow-growing over 4 years and does not exhibit classic melanoma features in the clinical description.

Pigmented extramammary Paget disease is a rare intraepidermal neoplasm that typically presents as a well-defined, slowly growing, pigmented plaque, usually in the anogenital area, but it can also occur in other sites such as axilla. The histopathologic analysis described pagetoid cells, characterized by round, pale, vacuolated cytoplasm and large pleomorphic nuclei, which are characteristic of extramammary Paget disease. Immunohistochemical staining for EMA (epithelial membrane antigen) is positive in extramammary Paget disease.

Therefore, given the clinical presentation, histopathologic findings, and immunohistochemical findings, the most likely diagnosis is pigmented extramammary Paget disease.

B: Subcutaneous dirofilariasis.

**Reasoning**: 

The patient presented with a firm, nontender, freely mobile nodule on the scalp, which is consistent with subcutaneous dirofilariasis. This is a parasitic infection caused by the larvae of Dirofilaria species, most commonly Dirofilaria repens or Dirofilaria immitis. 

The histopathological examination revealed a nodule in the dermis, surrounded by a fibrous capsule, and cross-sections of parasites were present within the nodule. The parasites showed an outer cuticle, a muscle layer, and a gravid uterus filled with microfilariae. This description is typical of Dirofilaria parasites.

Other possible diagnoses can be ruled out based on the absence of relevant clinical features. Onchocercoma, caused by Onchocerca species, typically presents with pruritus, skin nodules, and lymphadenopathy. Cutaneous loiasis, caused by Loa loa, usually presents with migratory subcutaneous swellings known as "Calabar swellings" and eosinophilia. Subcutaneous hydatid cysts, caused by Echinococcus species, usually have a different appearance on imaging studies and are associated with a history of exposure to infected animals.

B) Granulomatosis with polyangiitis

**Reasoning**: 
The patient presents with a recurrent sore throat associated with hoarseness of voice for 3 months. Despite taking multiple courses of oral antibiotics, there was no improvement in symptoms. This suggests that the underlying cause is not an infection. 

The patient also develops swelling and redness of the left ear that resolves and recurs every few weeks, which is consistent with auricular chondritis. This, along with the saddle-shaped deformity on the nose, suggests a systemic autoimmune disease affecting cartilage.

The nasoendoscopy revealed severe Reinke edema and chronic laryngitis, which can be seen in granulomatosis with polyangiitis.

The patient also presents with elevated inflammatory markers, including an elevated C-reactive protein level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and a microcytic hypochromic anemia. These findings are consistent with an inflammatory and systemic process.

The negative results for antinuclear antibody, anti-double-stranded DNA, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies suggest that the patient does not have systemic lupus erythematosus or vasculitis. 

Taking into consideration the clinical features and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is Granulomatosis with polyangiitis.

C: Order hemoglobin electrophoresis.

**Reasoning**:

The patient, a 60-year-old African American woman, presented with new floaters in her right eye and was found to have vitreous hemorrhage and retinal hemorrhages on examination. Widefield fluorescein angiography revealed retinal capillary nonperfusion with neovascularization elsewhere.

Given the patient's African American ethnicity and the presence of retinal findings consistent with sickle cell disease, it is important to evaluate for the possibility of sickle cell retinopathy. Hemoglobin electrophoresis is the appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis.

Performing a skin biopsy for pseudoxanthoma elasticum is not indicated in this case. Intravitreal corticosteroids would not be appropriate as a first-line treatment for sickle cell retinopathy. Exchange transfusion is a more invasive procedure and is not necessary at this point in the management.

D) Granulomatosis with polyangiitis. 

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the most likely diagnosis is granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), previously known as Wegener granulomatosis. GPA is a systemic vasculitis characterized by granulomatous inflammation and necrotizing vasculitis that primarily affects the upper and lower respiratory tracts, as well as the kidneys. The patient in this case presented with progressive upper airway obstruction, dysphagia, and weight loss, which are consistent with upper airway involvement seen in GPA.
Additional supporting factors for GPA include the presence of non-necrotizing granulomas in the supraglottis biopsy, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and diffuse edema and contrast enhancement seen on the neck CT scan.
Tuberculosis (Choice A) and sarcoidosis (Choice B) are both possibilities in the differential diagnosis, given the patient's history of parental latent tuberculosis infection and the presence of granulomas in the biopsy specimen. However, negative acid-fast bacilli and specific stains, as well as normal results on tuberculin purified protein derivative and interferon-γ release assay, make tuberculosis less likely. Sarcoidosis would typically have a more chronic and indolent course compared to the rapid progression seen in this case.
Epiglottitis (Choice C) is also a possibility, but it typically presents with sudden-onset severe sore throat, respiratory distress, and drooling. The absence of fever and normal white blood cell count make epiglottitis less likely.
Therefore, the most appropriate diagnosis in this case is granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA).

A) Initiate a uveitis workup for infectious and inflammatory conditions.

**Reasoning**: The 4-year-old girl presented with an asymptomatic, unilateral retinal mass. Given the presentation of the retinal mass, it is important to consider possible infectious and inflammatory causes. Initiating a uveitis workup will help to evaluate and identify any infectious or inflammatory conditions that may be contributing to the retinal mass. Other diagnostic tests such as examination under anesthesia, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be necessary depending on the results of the uveitis workup, but they should not be the first step in this case. Continuing to monitor clinically with serial examinations may delay diagnosis and appropriate management. Evaluating for cardiac rhabdomyoma and kidney cysts or tumors associated with neurocutaneous syndromes is not indicated based on the provided clinical information.

B) Perform resection surgery as soon as possible.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the patient's clinical presentation, physical examination findings, and imaging results, the most likely diagnosis is an intracardiac mass, specifically on the tricuspid valve. The patient has a history of uterine fibroids and an ovarian cyst, which are unrelated to the current findings. The presence of jugular venous pulsations and a grade 3/6 systolic murmur at the fifth intercostal space in the left side of the sternum suggest tricuspid regurgitation caused by the mobile mass on the tricuspid valve.

The laboratory abnormalities, including low platelet count, prolonged prothrombin time and activated partial thromboplastin time, and decreased fibrinogen level, suggest an underlying hypercoagulable state and potential embolic complications. The normal serum chemistry levels and absence of symptoms such as weight loss or fever decrease the suspicion of a malignant tumor.

Given the presence of a mobile intracardiac mass associated with tricuspid regurgitation, surgical resection should be the next step to both establish a definitive diagnosis and prevent potential complications such as embolization. Further imaging, such as positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT), may be considered to assess for metastasis but should not be the immediate next step in management. Antibiotic therapy may be considered if infective endocarditis is suspected, but in the absence of clinical signs of infection, blood cultures and antibiotic therapy are not the most appropriate initial approach. Anticoagulation therapy alone would not address the underlying cause of the mass and may increase the risk of embolization.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to perform resection surgery as soon as possible.

C: Repeat punch biopsy for hematoxylin-eosin staining and DIF.

**Reasoning**:
The patient developed a diffuse pruritic eruption recalcitrant to topical and oral corticosteroids after 20 months of treatment with pembrolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor. A shave biopsy performed while the patient was receiving systemic corticosteroids showed spongiotic dermatitis with a mixed-cell infiltrate suggesting an incipient autoimmune bullous process. However, the follow-up direct immunofluorescence (DIF) performed on a sample taken 15 days after steroid discontinuation was negative. 

Given the negative DIF and the development of tense bullae and indurated papules and plaques, a repeat punch biopsy for hematoxylin-eosin staining and DIF is needed to further evaluate the patient's skin condition. This will help in confirming the diagnosis and ruling out other possible causes.

B: Cancer-associated pancreatitis, panniculitis, and polyarthritis syndrome (PPP) syndrome.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the information provided in the case, the patient presented with articular symptoms, including heat, pain, redness, and swelling, starting in the fourth finger of the right hand and subsequently spreading to the left hallux and ankle. These symptoms were accompanied by the development of a fever. Despite attempts at treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), the patient developed widespread arthritis, primarily affecting the knee, shoulder, and hip.

Furthermore, the patient developed ill-defined skin nodules predominantly on the legs, suggestive of panniculitis. The presence of ill-defined cutaneous lesions, along with the joint symptoms, is characteristic of the PPP syndrome.

The patient also experienced acute abdominal pain in the left hypochondrium, along with nausea and vomiting, which led to a diagnosis of pancreatitis. High levels of lipase and amylase were found in the laboratory tests. Additionally, bone computed tomography (CT) revealed cortical bone destruction and intraosseous medullary necrosis in the shoulder and knee.

Taken together, these findings are consistent with the diagnosis of Cancer-associated pancreatitis, panniculitis, and polyarthritis syndrome (PPP) syndrome. Therefore, the correct answer is B.

C: Advise urgent plasmapheresis in consultation with oncology.

**Reasoning**:

Based on the presented clinical case, the teenage girl presents with optic nerve edema, venous stasis retinopathy, peripheral retinal whitening, and elevated intracranial pressure. The fundus examination also reveals hemorrhagic optic disc edema, tortuous and dilated retinal vasculature, and intraretinal hemorrhages in all 4 quadrants. These findings are suggestive of papilledema associated with increased intracranial pressure.

The elevated opening pressure on lumbar puncture further supports the diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). IIH is characterized by increased intracranial pressure without the presence of a mass or structural abnormality in the brain. It commonly affects overweight females of childbearing age. 

Considering the severe anemia, lymphocytosis with atypical lymphocytes, and elevated IgM level, there is concern for an underlying hematological malignancy or lymphoproliferative disorder. Plasmapheresis, which involves removing plasma from the patient and replacing it with donor plasma or albumin solution, is a procedure that can help alleviate the symptoms and complications associated with IIH.

Therefore, the next step would be to advise urgent plasmapheresis in consultation with oncology to address the underlying hematological condition and to relieve the symptoms and complications of IIH.

Reasoning: 

Based on the patient's history and examination findings, as well as the imaging results, the most likely diagnosis is a Juxtafacet cyst. 

The patient's symptoms of globus sensation, dysphagia, and localized throat swelling are consistent with the presence of a cyst in the pharyngeal area. The CT and MRI images show a cyst that is communicating with the atlantoaxial joint, suggesting an origin from the juxtafacet region.

Other options can be ruled out based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings. A mucus retention cyst typically presents with similar symptoms, but it would not communicate with the atlantoaxial joint. Tornwaldt cysts are typically located in the nasopharynx and would not extend to the atlantoaxial joint. Spinal bronchogenic cysts are typically found in the spinal canal and would not present with globus sensation and dysphagia.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a Juxtafacet cyst.

B: Photocoagulate lesions with argon laser at slitlamp evaluation

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical findings of a healthy older woman with episodes of nontraumatic transient vision loss and the subsequent examination results showing abnormal blood vessels at the pupillary margin of the iris, the next step would be to perform photocoagulation with argon laser at the slitlamp evaluation.

The presence of abnormal blood vessels and hyperfluorescent lesions on fluorescein angiography suggests the presence of abnormal vessel growth and neovascularization in the iris. Photocoagulation with argon laser can be used to treat these abnormal vessels and prevent further complications such as iris neovascularization and subsequent vision loss.

Observing until a repeated incident may not be appropriate in this case as there is already evidence of abnormal vessel growth and potential risk for vision loss.

Administering intravitreal bevacizumab injections may be a treatment option for neovascularization in other parts of the eye, such as the retina, but it is not the first-line treatment for abnormalities in the iris.

Performing iridocyclectomy to excise the lesions may be considered in certain cases of iris neovascularization, but it is more invasive and carries additional risks compared to photocoagulation with argon laser. It is generally reserved for cases when laser treatment is not effective or feasible.

B: IgG4-related disease.

**Reasoning**:
The patient in this case presents with progressive saddle nose deformity, nasal airway obstruction, crusting, and other nasal symptoms. The immunological workup showed elevated levels of complement C3 and total hemolytic complement (CH50). Nasal cultures were positive for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Bacteroides. 

Histopathologic examination revealed prominent lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, angiocentric fibrosis, and increased IgG4 absolute count, although the IgG4-IgG ratio was only slightly elevated.

These findings are consistent with IgG4-related disease, a rare fibroinflammatory disorder that can affect multiple organs, including the respiratory system. IgG4-related disease is characterized by a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, storiform fibrosis, and obliterative phlebitis. Elevated levels of IgG4 and IgG4-positive plasma cells in affected tissues are supportive of the diagnosis.

Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (formerly Churg-Strauss syndrome) presents with necrotizing vasculitis, eosinophilia, and involvement of multiple organs, including the lungs and upper airways. The absence of systemic symptoms, negative results for eosinophilia, and lack of evidence of vasculitis on histopathology make this diagnosis less likely.

Eosinophilic angiocentric fibrosis is a rare condition characterized by fibrotic changes and eosinophilic infiltrate in the nasal and paranasal sinus mucosa. The histopathology in this case did not show prominent eosinophils, making this diagnosis unlikely.

Chronic lymphoplasmacytic rhinosinusitis is a diagnosis of exclusion and requires the absence of other identifiable causes of chronic rhinosinusitis. In this case, the patient had positive nasal cultures and histopathologic findings consistent with IgG4-related disease, making chronic lymphoplasmacytic rhinosinusitis less likely.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation, histopathology, and immunological findings, the most likely diagnosis is IgG4-related disease.

C) Urgently start high-dose steroids, colchicine, and high-dose nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) during hospitalization.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation and findings in the case, the patient is a middle-aged woman with asthma who presented with dyspnea on exertion, substernal chest pain radiating to the jaw, weight loss, and physical examination findings of bibasilar crackles and nonreproducible chest tenderness. The electrocardiogram shows low voltages, inferior Q waves, and poor R-wave progression. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging reveals delayed mid-myocardial gadolinium enhancement, diffuse pericardial thickening, severe biventricular systolic dysfunction, and a small pericardial effusion.

The clinical presentation, imaging findings, and laboratory results are consistent with eosinophilic myocarditis, which is characterized by inflammation of the heart muscle with infiltration of eosinophils. The elevated eosinophil count, elevated troponin levels, elevated N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide, and high C-reactive protein support the diagnosis. The treatment for eosinophilic myocarditis typically involves immunosuppressive therapy to reduce eosinophil-mediated inflammation.

Therefore, the next step in management would be to urgently start high-dose steroids, colchicine, and high-dose nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) during hospitalization to reduce inflammation and prevent further damage to the myocardium. Percutaneous coronary stent placement would not be indicated in this case as the patient's symptoms and findings are not consistent with coronary artery disease. Outpatient follow-up in 4 weeks would not be appropriate given the severity of the patient's symptoms and findings. Urgent percutaneous drainage of the pericardial effusion would not be the next step in management and may not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

**Reasoning**: Based on the clinical presentation and histopathology findings, the most likely diagnosis in this case is B: Erythema gyratum repens-like eruption associated with mycosis fungoides.

1. The patient presents with a widespread, intermittently pruritic eruption of coalescing annular, arcuate, and serpiginous red scaling plaques in a concentric pattern. This description is consistent with erythema gyratum repens-like eruption.
2. The punch biopsy from the chest reveals epidermal hyperplasia with spongiosis and parakeratosis, as well as a superficial dermal and epidermotropic infiltrate of atypical lymphocytes, which are characteristic findings seen in mycosis fungoides.
3. Erythema gyratum repens is a clinical manifestation associated with mycosis fungoides, a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

B: Aqueous tap.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation of a 37-year-old African American man with progressive loss of iris pigmentation, photophobia, and decreased visual acuity, the differential diagnosis includes conditions such as exfoliation syndrome, pigment dispersion syndrome, and uveitis. 

However, the absence of other ocular symptoms, history of trauma or surgery, normal intraocular pressure, and findings of patchy iris atrophy and transillumination defects on slit-lamp examination make exfoliation syndrome less likely. 
Similarly, the absence of Krukenberg spindle on gonioscopy and mid-dilated round pupils without posterior synechiae make pigment dispersion syndrome less likely.

Given the possibility of uveitis as a cause of the patient's symptoms, an aqueous tap should be performed. An aqueous tap is a diagnostic procedure that involves obtaining a sample of the fluid (aqueous humor) within the anterior chamber of the eye. This can provide valuable information regarding the presence of inflammatory cells or infectious agents that may be causing the uveitis.

Therefore, the next step in the management of this patient would be to perform an aqueous tap (option B) to help determine the underlying cause of the progressive loss of iris pigmentation and guide further management.

After reviewing the clinical case and the imaging results, the possible diagnoses for the enhancing structure at the skull base along the carotid sheath include Schwannoma, Paraganglioma, Persistent trigeminal artery, and Persistent hypoglossal artery.
 
Schwannomas are benign tumors that arise from Schwann cells of the peripheral nerves. However, in this case, the enhancing structure at the skull base is not likely to be a Schwannoma because Schwannomas typically do not occur adjacent to the carotid sheath and are more commonly found in the head and neck region.

Paragangliomas are neuroendocrine tumors that arise from paraganglion cells associated with the autonomic nervous system. While paragangliomas can occur along the carotid sheath, they typically have a characteristic salt-and-pepper appearance on imaging due to their hypervascularity and hemorrhagic areas. Therefore, the enhancing structure seen in the imaging is less likely to be a paraganglioma.

A persistent trigeminal artery is a developmental variant in which the embryonic trigeminal artery fails to regress. This artery can traverse the carotid sheath and be seen in imaging studies. However, a persistent trigeminal artery would typically have a more consistent and tubular appearance, rather than the localized enhancing structure seen in the imaging. Therefore, a persistent trigeminal artery is less likely in this case.

A persistent hypoglossal artery is another developmental variant in which the embryonic hypoglossal artery does not regress. It can also be seen traversing the carotid sheath on imaging studies. Given the location and appearance of the enhancing structure along the carotid sheath in the imaging, a persistent hypoglossal artery is the most likely diagnosis.

Therefore, the diagnosis most consistent with the imaging findings is D: Persistent hypoglossal artery.

C: Perform a vitreous tap for viral polymerase chain reaction.

**Reasoning**:
The patient's clinical presentation, including floaters, posterior pole intraretinal hemorrhages, retinal neovascularization, macular traction and striae, peripheral vascular sheathing, and retinal capillary nonperfusion, along with her medical history of patchy hair loss, violaceous maculopapular rash, and headaches, suggests a possible diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with associated lupus retinopathy. 

SLE is an autoimmune disease characterized by multisystem involvement, including the skin, joints, kidneys, and central nervous system. Ophthalmic manifestations of SLE can occur in up to one-third of patients and may include retinal vasculitis, retinal hemorrhages, cotton wool spots, macular edema, and rarely, retinal neovascularization.

In this case, there are features suggestive of lupus retinopathy, such as intraretinal hemorrhages, retinal neovascularization, and peripheral vascular sheathing. To further investigate the underlying etiology, a vitreous tap for viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) should be performed to rule out possible viral causes of retinal inflammation and neovascularization, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis. CMV retinitis can occur in patients with compromised immune systems, including those with SLE.

Performing a vitreous tap for viral PCR is necessary to provide a definitive diagnosis and guide appropriate management in this case. Other options, such as observing the patient, performing MRI/MRA of the brain, and administering intravitreal foscarnet, are not indicated as they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and would not provide useful information for the diagnosis of lupus retinopathy.

B: Cryptococcal infection.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the presented information, the patient is an older woman who presents with an edematous and ulcerative eruption on the extremities, buttocks, and face, with distinct sparing at the nasolabial folds. This pattern of involvement is characteristic of Cryptococcal infection. 

Other findings in the case, such as extreme fatigue, weight loss, recent episode of hematochezia, leukocytosis, normocytic anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hematuria, proteinuria, and lung nodules on computed tomography, can also be seen in Cryptococcal infection.

The punch biopsies and skin biopsy findings are important to establish the diagnosis. However, the description in the case does not provide specific information regarding the biopsy findings.

Considering the patient's medical history and medication use, there is no mention of recent medication changes or new exposures, making drug-induced vasculitis less likely to be the diagnosis.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation and findings, Cryptococcal infection is the most likely diagnosis.

C

**Reasoning**:
Based on the history and examination findings, this patient likely has inflammatory back pain with morning stiffness and involvement of both the axial skeleton and peripheral joints. The presence of bilateral hip pain, hand pain, and swelling of the MCP and PIP joints, along with limited range of motion in the back, suggests an axial spondyloarthritis (SpA) as the underlying diagnosis.

The HLA-B27 test was negative, which is not uncommon in SpA and does not rule out the diagnosis. Furthermore, the radiographic findings of sclerosis and joint narrowing at both sacroiliac joints, as well as joint narrowing and osteophytes in the hip joints bilaterally, are consistent with the diagnosis of axial SpA.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the sacroiliac joint is the next appropriate step to confirm the diagnosis of axial SpA. MRI can detect inflammation in the sacroiliac joints, which is the hallmark of the disease. This imaging modality is more sensitive than plain radiographs for detecting early inflammatory changes.

Therefore, the next step in the evaluation of this patient would be to order magnetic resonance imaging of the sacroiliac joint (option C).

Reasoning: Given the patient's symptoms of decreased exercise tolerance, shortness of breath, and heart palpitations, as well as the physical examination findings of a fixed split S2 and a 2/6 systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border, there is a suspicion of a cardiac abnormality. The electrocardiogram showing incomplete right bundle-branch block and the chest radiograph demonstrating an enlarged right atrium and right ventricle further support this suspicion. 

Given these findings, the next step would be to obtain further imaging to evaluate the cardiac anatomy and function. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (Option A) is a non-invasive imaging modality that can provide detailed information about cardiac structure, function, and blood flow, making it a useful diagnostic tool in this scenario.

Performing a cardiac catheterization (Option C) may be considered if there is a need for invasive assessment and intervention, but it would not be the initial step in this case.

Starting an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (Option B) would not be appropriate at this time, as the diagnosis and underlying cause of the patient's symptoms have not been established.

Referring to a pulmonologist (Option D) would also not be the initial step, as the symptoms and findings are more suggestive of a cardiac etiology rather than a primary pulmonary condition.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to order cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (Option A).

**Reasoning**: In this case, the patient presented with asymptomatic green-gray nodules on the chest, which had been stable for 4 months. The nodules had a green hue at their base following shave biopsy. These findings are consistent with chloroma, also known as extramedullary myeloid sarcoma. Chloromas are soft tissue tumors comprised of immature myeloid cells. They typically occur in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) or other myeloproliferative disorders. Given the patient's history of AML and allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, chloroma is the most likely diagnosis in this case.

B) Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome)

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation and diagnostic findings, the most likely diagnosis in this case is eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), also known as Churg-Strauss syndrome. 

EGPA is a rare systemic vasculitis characterized by the infiltration of eosinophils in various organs, including the lungs, skin, heart, and nervous system. The clinical presentation is variable, but patients often present with symptoms related to systemic inflammation and organ damage. In this case, the patient's symptoms of dizziness, fatigue, tingling of extremities, and gait disturbances are consistent with nervous system involvement commonly seen in EGPA.

The physical examination findings of pyramidal weakness, brisk reflexes, extensor plantar response, and sensory deficits are also suggestive of central nervous system involvement.

The MRI findings of multiple enhancing lesions in the brain and cervical spine further support a diagnosis of EGPA. These lesions are likely a result of inflammatory infiltrates and vasculitis.

The presence of enlarged lymph nodes, particularly in the cervical and supraclavicular regions, is consistent with lymphadenopathy seen in EGPA.

The elevated eosinophil count in the peripheral blood is a hallmark finding in EGPA and further supports the diagnosis.

Other potential differential diagnoses in this case include encephalomyelitis with hyperIgEaemia, lymphoma, and sarcoidosis. However, the absence of characteristic findings, such as hyperIgEaemia, in encephalomyelitis and the lack of evidence for malignancy or systemic autoimmune diseases make these less likely.

Overall, the combination of clinical symptoms, physical examination findings, MRI findings, laboratory abnormalities, and exclusion of other potential causes support a diagnosis of eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome).

Given the symptoms of dysphagia, dyspnea, cough, and fever, along with the presence of exudative foci in both lungs on chest radiography, there is a concern for a possible infectious etiology. Tuberculosis is a common infectious disease that can present with both pulmonary and esophageal involvement.

D) Perform an endothelial keratoplasty. 

**Reasoning**: The patient presents with corneal edema, which is characterized by pinpoint epithelial defects, thickened stroma, dense Descemet folds, and elevated central pachymetry. These findings indicate endothelial dysfunction and compromised corneal transparency. Additionally, the presence of a vitreous hemorrhage suggests a possible underlying vascular abnormality. Given the severity of the corneal edema and the patient's visual impairment, the most appropriate next step would be to perform an endothelial keratoplasty to replace the dysfunctional endothelial layer and restore corneal clarity. Intrastromal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) would not address the underlying endothelial dysfunction, topical corticosteroid eyedrops would not have a significant impact on corneal edema, and oral and/or topical antiviral medications are not indicated based on the patient's history and clinical presentation.

**Reasoning**: Based on the provided information, the patient presented with episodes of back and abdominal pain associated with nausea, vomiting, and flushing. Immediately following abdominal ultrasonography, the patient experienced intense flushing and vomiting. Subsequent imaging identified a 5-cm thoracic paraspinal mass encasing the descending aorta with neural foramen extension.

Considering these findings, the most likely diagnosis is **C: Malignant pheochromocytoma**. Pheochromocytomas are rare tumors that arise from chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla or extra-adrenal paraganglia. They can secrete excessive amounts of catecholamines, leading to episodic symptoms such as flushing, sweating, hypertension, and tachycardia. The presence of intense flushing and vomiting following the abdominal ultrasonography suggests a paroxysmal release of catecholamines, consistent with a pheochromocytoma.

Other options:

A: Histiocytoma - Histiocytomas are benign skin tumors that are unrelated to the symptoms and imaging findings described in this case.

B: Mastocytoma - Mastocytomas are tumors composed of mast cells, and although they can cause flushing and other symptoms, they are typically not associated with back and abdominal pain or the specific imaging findings described in this case.

D: Myeloid sarcoma - Myeloid sarcomas are extramedullary tumors composed of immature myeloid cells. They can occur in patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myeloproliferative disorders, but they typically present with localized symptoms, such as a mass, without the characteristic episodic symptoms seen in this case.

C: Perform a transscleral subretinal biopsy.

**Reasoning**:
The case describes a patient who underwent lung transplant for cystic fibrosis and developed acute vision loss with retinal whitening and occlusive vasculitis in the right eye, and extensive retinal whitening with an exudative retinal detachment in the left eye. Despite broad-spectrum antimicrobial treatment, the patient's condition worsened, and there were concerns for systemic spread of infection.

Given the inconclusive microbiological analysis and the worsening condition, performing a transscleral subretinal biopsy would be the next appropriate step. This would allow for a direct sampling of the subretinal infiltrate for further microbiological analysis, which may help identify the causative agent and guide targeted therapy. Additionally, the biopsy may provide information about the extent of the infection and potential involvement of adjacent structures.

Repeating diagnostic vitrectomy with repeated subretinal biopsy in the left eye is also a consideration, but it would be more appropriate to perform a new procedure (transscleral subretinal biopsy) to increase the likelihood of obtaining a conclusive diagnosis.

Increasing systemic immunosuppressive therapy should be avoided at this point, as the patient's condition is deteriorating and the cause of the ocular findings is still unclear.

Continuing intravitreal injections of antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral medications is unlikely to be beneficial since there has been no improvement with previous interventions and the microbiological analysis has been negative.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings described, the most likely diagnosis is Esthesioneuroblastoma (A). Esthesioneuroblastoma is a rare malignant tumor that arises from the olfactory epithelium, typically located in the superior nasal cavity or cribriform plate area. It commonly presents with symptoms such as frontal pain, pressure, clear nasal discharge, and progressive nontender facial swelling, which are consistent with the symptoms in this case. Imaging studies, such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, can show the location and extent of the tumor. The histopathology findings of uniform, epithelioid cells arranged in a whorled, lobulated growth pattern without atypia or necrosis, as described in the case, are characteristic of esthesioneuroblastoma. The presence of intranuclear inclusions, as seen in Figure C, can also be observed in esthesioneuroblastoma. Pott puffy tumor (B) is a rare complication of frontal sinusitis characterized by a subperiosteal abscess and frontal bone osteomyelitis. Sinonasal meningioma (C) and sinonasal neuroendocrine carcinoma (D) are less likely given the histopathological findings described.

The patient has a history of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, which was confirmed by biopsy and subsequent treatment with radiation therapy and cetuximab. The patient's post-treatment imaging showed complete resolution of the base of tongue mass and cervical lymph nodes, indicating a positive response to treatment.

However, in the follow-up FDG-PET/CT scan, the patient presented with a palpable left supraclavicular lymph node and avid supraclavicular and anterolateral neck adenopathy, indicating the presence of metastasis. Additionally, there was moderately intense activity isolated to the left thyroid lobe, and subsequent biopsy confirmed the presence of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.

Therefore, the diagnosis in this case is metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms, including exertional calf discomfort that worsens over time and interferes with work, are consistent with peripheral artery disease (PAD). The physical examination findings of diminished blood pressure and the exercise treadmill ABI test results (Table) suggest the presence of significant arterial disease in the lower extremities.

**Reasoning**: The patient's presentation with abdominal pain, distention, and a mass at the base of the cecum raises concern for a possible appendiceal mass. The presence of ascites and elevation of the serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level further suggest a possible malignancy. Given these findings, the next step would be to obtain a tissue diagnosis through surgical exploration with laparoscopic appendectomy and peritoneal biopsy (Option A). Repeat image-guided paracentesis/cytology (Option B) may not yield diagnostic results if the previous attempts were nondiagnostic. Colonoscopy with biopsy (Option C) may be considered in some cases, but given the imaging findings and suspicion for appendiceal mass, surgical exploration would be more appropriate. Finally, ordering broad-spectrum antibiotics (Option D) alone would not provide a definitive diagnosis or address the underlying mass. Therefore, the best next step would be to perform laparoscopic appendectomy and peritoneal biopsy.

Based on the clinical presentation of a well-circumscribed plaque on the elbow with micaceous scale, punctate hemorrhagic crusts, and a history of prior injury, as well as the histopathologic findings of psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia overlying suppurative granulomatous infiltrates with multinucleate giant cells, the most likely diagnosis is D: Sarcoidosis. 

Sporotrichosis is a fungal infection that typically presents as nodules and ulcerations, and it does not typically have the histopathologic features seen in this case. 

Koebnerized psoriasis vulgaris occurs at sites of trauma, but it does not have the characteristic micaceous scale or the histopathologic findings seen in this case. 

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a systemic vasculitis that typically presents with necrotizing granulomas involving multiple organs, and it is not likely to present as a solitary elbow plaque without systemic symptoms. 

Sarcoidosis, on the other hand, is a multisystem granulomatous disorder that can present with cutaneous involvement and may have a predilection for the elbows. It can present with well-circumscribed plaques and can histopathologically show psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia overlying granulomatous infiltrates with multinucleate giant cells. Therefore, given the clinical and histopathologic findings, the most likely diagnosis in this case is sarcoidosis.

C: Initiate venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

**Reasoning**:
The patient in this case developed hypotension and experienced an asystolic cardiac arrest despite quick balloon inflations and good coronary blood flow. These findings suggest that the patient is in cardiogenic shock, which is a life-threatening condition characterized by inadequate cardiac output leading to tissue hypoperfusion. In this situation, supportive measures to improve cardiac output are urgently needed. 

Option A, inserting a percutaneous left ventricular assist device, may be considered in the management of cardiogenic shock, but in this case, it is not the next immediate step. The patient should first receive a more readily accessible and rapidly deployable form of mechanical circulatory support.

Option B, performing pericardiocentesis with autologous blood transfusion, is not indicated in this case as there are no findings to suggest cardiac tamponade.

Option D, performing root and ascending aortography, is not the next step because the patient is currently in a state of cardiac arrest and needs immediate intervention to support cardiac function.

Venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) can provide temporary mechanical circulatory support in patients with cardiogenic shock and cardiac arrest. It can rapidly restore systemic perfusion while the underlying cause of shock is addressed. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in this case would be to initiate venoarterial ECMO.

It is important to note that this is a clinical judgment and there may be other possible management options depending on the specific clinical scenario and resources available.

Based on the clinical presentation and histological findings, the most likely diagnosis is chondroma. The patient presented with dysphonia and increased vocal effort, which correlates with the presence of the firm lesion in the left paraglottic space extending to the lateral aspect of the true vocal fold. The lesion was composed of fragments of cartilage without mitosis or nuclear atypia, consistent with a benign cartilaginous tumor.

Based on the clinical presentation and histologic findings, the most likely diagnosis is a focal melanotic macule (focal melanosis). Focal melanotic macules are benign, pigmented lesions that commonly occur on the oral mucosa. They are typically asymptomatic and have well-defined borders. Histologically, they show an increased number of benign dendritic melanocytes within the epithelium.

A 

**Reasoning**:

The key features of this case include a 34-year-old man with progressive unilateral lower lip and chin numbness and facial fullness, limited to the distribution of the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve (V3). There are no palpable masses in the head, neck, or face. The MRI findings show a T1 isointense, T2 hyperintense lesion in the left masticator space centered in the lateral pterygoid muscle with benign-appearing remodeling of the posterior maxillary wall. 

Based on these features, the most likely diagnosis is Schwannoma. Schwannomas are benign nerve sheath tumors that can arise from any peripheral nerve, including the trigeminal nerve. They commonly present with progressive unilateral numbness and can cause facial fullness. The MRI findings of a T1 isointense, T2 hyperintense lesion are consistent with Schwannoma. The absence of palpable masses and the lack of other cranial nerve deficits further support this diagnosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is A: Schwannoma.

B) Metastatic carotid body tumors.

**Reasoning**:

Based on the clinical history and imaging findings, the presence of a large mass centered at the left carotid bifurcation splaying the internal and external carotid arteries, as well as a smaller mass at the right carotid bifurcation, suggests a primary tumor originating from the carotid body.

Metastases to the liver and multiple osseous lesions are also observed, indicating a widespread metastatic disease process.

Metastatic glomus vagale tumors typically arise from the paraganglia along the vagus nerve and may involve the carotid space, but the clinical presentation and imaging findings described in this case are more consistent with a carotid body tumor.

Metastatic sarcoma is a broad term encompassing various malignant mesenchymal tumors. However, the clinical history and imaging findings described in this case are not suggestive of sarcoma.

Lymphoma typically presents with constitutional symptoms (fever, weight loss, night sweats), which are absent in this case. The imaging findings also do not support a diagnosis of lymphoma.

C: Order optical coherence tomography.

**Reasoning**:
In this case, the patient presented with bilateral central vision loss and ocular examination revealed reddened foveal lesions and irregular macular pigmentation. These findings suggest involvement of the macula, which is responsible for central vision. To further evaluate the macular pathology, optical coherence tomography (OCT) should be ordered. OCT provides detailed cross-sectional images of the retina and can help identify structural abnormalities in the macula, such as edema or atrophy, which may be causing the central scotoma. Indocyanine green angiography may be helpful in certain cases, but it is not the next best step in this patient as it primarily evaluates choroidal vessels and is not likely to provide additional information about the macular pathology. Discontinuing immunosuppression therapy may be considered in some cases, but there is no indication that the patient's bilateral central scotoma is related to his Crohn disease or its treatment. Repeat neuroimaging is not necessary at this point as the initial MRI of the orbit and brain was unremarkable and there are no new neurologic signs or symptoms.

B: Perform lumbar puncture with opening pressure.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical findings and imaging results, the patient has signs of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) such as bilateral optic nerve head edema and imaging findings of elevated ICP (empty sella, posterior flattening of the globes, widened optic nerve sheaths). These findings indicate the need for further evaluation of the ICP.

Lumbar puncture with measurement of opening pressure is the gold standard for diagnosing increased ICP. It involves inserting a needle into the spinal canal to obtain and measure the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure. It can help confirm the diagnosis of elevated ICP and determine the severity.

Obtaining enhanced depth imaging–optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT) may provide additional information about the optic nerve and retinal structures, but it does not directly measure intracranial pressure and would not be the first step in the diagnostic workup.

Obtaining venography (computed tomography or magnetic resonance) of the brain may help identify potential causes of increased ICP, such as venous sinus thrombosis, but it does not directly measure intracranial pressure and would not be the first step in the diagnostic workup.

Prescribing acetazolamide, a medication that reduces cerebrospinal fluid production, may be considered as a treatment option for elevated ICP, but it should not be initiated without confirming the diagnosis and determining the severity of increased ICP through lumbar puncture.

The patient's history of heavy alcohol consumption and poor nutrition raises suspicion for nutritional deficiencies. Both vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies can lead to optic neuropathy and visual loss. Assessing the serum levels of these vitamins would help determine if there is a deficiency and guide appropriate supplementation. Liver function tests (option A) may be considered in patients with alcohol-related liver disease, but they are not the most appropriate next step in this case. Treatment with disulfiram (option C) is not indicated as the patient's vision loss is likely related to nutritional deficiencies rather than alcohol use.

C: Stop netarsudil in both eyes.

**Reasoning**:
In this case, the patient presented with pain and irritation in the right eye, along with corneal edema and neovascularization. The symptoms and findings suggest corneal endothelial dysfunction, which can be caused by medications such as netarsudil.

Netarsudil is a rho kinase inhibitor that is used to reduce intraocular pressure in patients with glaucoma. However, corneal endothelial toxicity is a known side effect of netarsudil, and it can lead to corneal edema and ultimately vision loss.

In this case, the patient had worsening corneal edema and decreased visual acuity after starting netarsudil therapy. To manage this condition, the next step would be to discontinue netarsudil in both eyes to prevent further corneal endothelial damage and allow for potential recovery of corneal function.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: Stop netarsudil in both eyes.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation and laboratory findings, this patient has features suggestive of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) with Raynaud phenomenon. Raynaud phenomenon is a common initial manifestation of systemic sclerosis and is characterized by episodic vasospasm of the digital arteries, leading to color changes (pallor, cyanosis, and rubor), pain, and ulcers.

In this case, the patient has ulcerations involving the fingertips, along with other clinical features such as hair loss, dryness of the eyes and mouth, and esophageal dysphagia. The periungual erythema with dilated nailfold capillaries and positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA) further support a diagnosis of systemic sclerosis. Additionally, the absence of oral ulcers, pleuritic chest pain, joint pain, and other systemic symptoms makes other diagnoses less likely.

The treatment for digital ulcers in systemic sclerosis involves a multidisciplinary approach. In general, vasodilator therapy, such as calcium channel blockers like nifedipine, can be beneficial in improving blood flow to the affected areas. However, in this case, the patient's symptoms are severe and progressive, suggesting the need for more aggressive treatment.

Intravenous pulse-dose methylprednisolone is a reasonable choice as it can help suppress the underlying autoimmune process and reduce inflammation. This can be followed by long-term immunosuppressive therapy such as mycophenolate mofetil or methotrexate.

Initiating therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin is not indicated in this case, as there is no evidence of acute thrombosis or embolism. Empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is also not warranted as there are no signs or symptoms of infection.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to give intravenous pulse-dose methylprednisolone.

Reasoning:

Based on the clinical presentation, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are suggestive of a systemic granulomatous disease. The presence of erythematous and scaly plaques on the lower extremities, which spread proximally, along with weight loss and new lesions on the arms and abdomen, are consistent with a granulomatous dermatitis.

The neurological findings of lower extremity edema, weakness, allodynia, tingling, and numbness suggest peripheral neuropathy, which can be associated with some granulomatous diseases.

The histologic findings of granulomatous inflammation throughout the dermis with well-formed epithelioid granulomas support the diagnosis of a granulomatous dermatitis. 

Considering the clinical presentation and histologic findings, the most likely diagnosis is A: Plaque and ichthyosiform sarcoidosis.

C) Unilesional folliculotropic mycosis fungoides

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation and histopathologic findings, the most likely diagnosis is unilesional folliculotropic mycosis fungoides. Mycosis fungoides is a subtype of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma characterized by infiltration of atypical lymphocytes into the skin. In this case, the patient presented with a solitary plaque on the eyelid, which is consistent with the unilesional variant of mycosis fungoides. The clinical features of an erythematous, violaceous, indurated, scaly plaque with papules are also typical of mycosis fungoides.

Histopathologic examination revealed perifollicular lymphocytic infiltrates with exocytosis of atypical lymphocytes into the epithelium, which is characteristic of mycosis fungoides. Additionally, immunohistochemical analysis showed lymphocytic infiltrates positive for CD3, CD4, CD5, and CD7, which is consistent with a T-cell lymphoma.

The other answer choices can be ruled out based on the clinical presentation and histopathologic findings. Discoid lupus erythematosus typically presents with well-demarcated erythematous plaques and is associated with autoantibodies such as antinuclear antibodies. Facial papules in frontal fibrosing alopecia typically present as hair loss and scarring alopecia, which is not seen in this case. Jessner lymphocytic infiltrate typically presents with small, erythematous, firm papules or plaques and lacks the atypical lymphocytes seen in this case.

Reasoning: The patient's history of follicular lymphoma and breast cancer, as well as the use of rituximab, suggests a possibility of central nervous system involvement. In this case, the MRI findings of T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensity in the left occipital and temporal lobes, crossing the corpus callosum, and extending into the right occipital lobe are consistent with the diagnosis of central nervous system lymphoma.

C) Obtain chest radiographs.

**Reasoning**:
The patient has an abnormal ECG following pacemaker implantation. It is important to first evaluate the position and integrity of the pacemaker leads to determine if there is any lead displacement or pneumothorax. Chest radiographs can help visualize the placement and position of the pacemaker leads and diagnose any potential complications such as lead dislodgement, lead fracture, or pneumothorax. This will provide important information for further management decisions. Pacing device placement (A), transcutaneous pacing (B), and placing a magnet on the pulse generator (D) are not appropriate initial steps in evaluating an abnormal ECG following pacemaker implantation.

Reasoning: The patient's history of HIV and untreated syphilis, along with the findings of violaceous nodules in the base of the tongue and the lower extremities, are suggestive of Kaposi sarcoma. Kaposi sarcoma is commonly seen in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV, and is associated with human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) infection. The biopsy findings of a subepithelial spindle cell lesion that stains strongly for HHV-8 further support the diagnosis of Kaposi sarcoma.

C: Secretory carcinoma. 

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation and pathological findings, the most probable diagnosis is secretory carcinoma. 

Secretory carcinoma is a slow-growing salivary gland tumor that is commonly seen in children and young adults. It typically presents as a painless mass in the parotid gland. The ultrasound findings of a solid and hypoechoic mass with minimal vascularity and absence of lymph node abnormalities are consistent with secretory carcinoma. 

The fine-needle aspiration showed cellular smear with sheets and clusters of bland polygonal epithelial cells admixed with bright pink filamentous matrix, which is also consistent with secretory carcinoma. Secretory carcinoma is characterized by its microcystic and papillary architecture, which is seen in the histopathology findings. Additionally, the presence of abundant bubbly secretion within the microcystic spaces, positivity for periodic acid-Schiff staining, and positive immunohistochemical stains for epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratin 7 and 19, S100 protein, and gross cystic disease fluid protein 15 (GCDFP-15) are all consistent with secretory carcinoma. 

Acinic cell carcinoma may also be considered as a differential diagnosis, but it typically presents in older individuals and lacks the specific histopathological features seen in secretory carcinoma. Adenocarcinoma, not otherwise specified, is a broad category that does not fit the specific findings in this case. Low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma usually presents with cystic areas and mucin production, which are not prominent in this case.

C: Complete serum immunoglobulin level tests, DNA molecular analysis, and bone marrow biopsy.

**Reasoning**:
The presentation of multiple patchy, yellow choroidal lesions with loss of choroidal vascular detail throughout the entire fundus, along with the presence of faint conjunctival thickening at the limbus suggestive of lymphoid tumor, raises suspicion for a lymphoma involving the eye. However, further investigation is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of the disease.

Completing serum immunoglobulin level tests, DNA molecular analysis, and bone marrow biopsy are necessary steps to evaluate for systemic lymphoma involvement and determine the specific subtype of lymphoma. This information is crucial for guiding treatment decisions.

Initiating an oral corticosteroid plus intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy (Option A) would not be appropriate at this stage, as the underlying cause of the visual acuity loss has not been confirmed and treated.

Administering topical interferon (Option B) may be considered as a treatment option for some types of conjunctival lymphomas, but it would not address the potential systemic involvement or provide a definitive diagnosis.

Beginning systemic intravenous rituximab (Option D) would be premature without confirming the diagnosis and determining the subtype of lymphoma.

Therefore, completing serum immunoglobulin level tests, DNA molecular analysis, and bone marrow biopsy is the next appropriate step in evaluating this patient with visual acuity loss and choroidal lesions.

C: Excisional biopsy

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation of a progressively enlarging eyelid lesion, associated with ipsilateral facial numbness and hypoesthesia in the distribution of the trigeminal maxillary branch, varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection should be considered. VZV is known to cause herpes zoster ophthalmicus, which is characterized by the involvement of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve.

Given that the patient did not improve with antibiotics and the lesion is ulcerated with surrounding edema and erythema, excisional biopsy is the next appropriate step. Excisional biopsy would allow for histopathological examination of the lesion to confirm the diagnosis of VZV infection and exclude other potential causes such as bacterial infection or malignancy.

Continued antibiotic therapy would not be appropriate as there is no improvement with initial antibiotic treatment, and the clinical presentation is not consistent with a bacterial infection.

Wound debridement may be necessary if there are signs of necrotizing infection; however, the absence of severe pain, signs of necrosis, and normal findings on anterior segment examination and dilated fundus evaluation make it less likely in this case.

A computed tomography (CT) scan of the orbits may be considered in certain cases, such as when orbital cellulitis or abscess is suspected. However, based on the clinical presentation, VZV infection seems more likely, and an excisional biopsy would provide a definitive diagnosis.

A) Administer systemic corticosteroids

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the patient is most likely experiencing a retinal vaso-occlusive disease, which can be caused by a variety of conditions such as ocular ischemic syndrome or central retinal vein occlusion. This is supported by the findings of retinal hemorrhages, vascular sheathing, venous engorgement, tortuosity, and retinal whitening.

The next step in management would be to administer systemic corticosteroids. Systemic corticosteroids can help reduce inflammation and edema in the affected eye, which can potentially improve visual outcomes. The presence of anterior chamber cell, vitreous cell, and significant optic nerve edema suggest a severe inflammatory process, warranting systemic treatment.

Intraocular corticosteroid injections may be considered as an alternative or adjunctive treatment option in certain cases, but given the severity and rapidly progressing nature of the disease, systemic corticosteroids would be the more appropriate initial intervention.

Administering valacyclovir would not be indicated in this case since there are no signs or symptoms suggestive of an infectious etiology.
Administering benzathine penicillin G would not be indicated as there are no signs or symptoms to suggest a bacterial infection requiring this treatment.

The patient presented with peripheral vision loss, slowly progressive difficulty with night driving and perceiving objects in the periphery over the past 5 years. There is also optic nerve pallor and vascular attenuation observed on dilated fundus examination, as well as a subtle area of increased pigmentation in the superior retina. These findings are suggestive of a neurological cause rather than a primary retinal pathology. Therefore, it would be appropriate to perform a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain to evaluate for any structural abnormalities, such as optic nerve or brain lesions, which could be contributing to the patient's symptoms.

D: Computed tomography scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.

**Reasoning**:

Given the clinical presentation of long-standing iris lesions and the patient's complaint of progressive visual obscuration in the left eye, it is important to consider the possibility of metastatic cancer. The presence of multiple brown masses at the pupillary margin in both eyes can be suspicious for iris metastasis.

To determine the primary source of the metastasis, a workup including imaging studies should be performed. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is a common initial imaging modality to evaluate for primary malignancies and potential metastatic disease. This will help in identifying any potential primary tumors and determine the extent of metastatic spread.

Other options such as surgical iridectomy, kidney ultrasonography, and positron emission tomography scan may be considered at later stages based on the results of the CT scan and further evaluation. However, a CT scan is the most appropriate next step in this case to assess for the presence of any primary malignancy.

B

**Reasoning**:

The patient presents with a cavitary lung mass and worsening symptoms despite empiric antibiotic therapy. The presence of charcoal-colored pleural fluid suggests a possible fungal infection. The initial treatment with voriconazole covers for Aspergillus infection, but given the negative fungal stain and the worsening symptoms, it may be necessary to consider an alternative antifungal agent such as liposomal amphotericin B. Therefore, the next step would be to change voriconazole to liposomal amphotericin B (Option B).

**Reasoning**:
Based on the patient's history of generalized pruritus for 10 years, along with the clinical findings of erythematous papules, crusted papules, excoriations, and scales/fissures on the lower lip, the most likely diagnosis is Actinic Prurigo Cheilitis. Actinic prurigo is a photodermatosis characterized by pruritic, papular eruptions that occur predominantly on sun-exposed areas such as the face, neck, and arms. Cheilitis refers to inflammation of the lips, which can manifest as scaling, fissures, and crusts. The presence of these characteristic skin lesions, along with the long-standing pruritus and lack of response to topical corticosteroids, supports this diagnosis.

B: Coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the patient is a 32-year-old man with chronic left ventricular dysfunction, dilated cardiomyopathy, and symptoms of angina and dyspnea with exertion. His echocardiography shows an ejection fraction of 40% and exercise stress test reveals severe hypokinesis of the distal anterior wall and apex, indicating significant myocardial ischemia.

The electrocardiogram shows right bundle branch block and left anterior fascicular block, which are chronic findings and unchanged from previous years. This suggests chronic myocardial damage and subsequent cardiac remodeling.

Given the fixed severe apical defect and partially reversible severe anterior wall defect on the exercise nuclear stress test, it is indicative of significant coronary artery disease. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) alone may not be sufficient due to the extent of the disease and the presence of multiple vessel involvement.

Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery would be the next step in management. CABG provides a more comprehensive revascularization method and can address multiple diseased vessels. It is the preferred option in patients with multi-vessel disease and left ventricular dysfunction.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in this case would be B: Coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation of painless progressive vision loss, gait changes, memory loss, and unintentional weight loss, along with the findings of homonymous hemianopia and cognitive impairment on examination, the differential diagnosis includes neurodegenerative disorders such as prion diseases. Prion diseases can present with a combination of cognitive decline, visual disturbances, and motor abnormalities. Magnetic resonance imaging and other tests were unremarkable, and there were no localizing signs on electroencephalogram. In this case, ordering a cerebrospinal fluid prion disease panel can help evaluate for the presence of abnormal prion proteins, which can confirm the diagnosis of a prion disease.

C: Order systemic laboratory workup.

**Reasoning**:

The patient presented with slowly progressive unilateral blepharoptosis and a palpable mass of the upper eyelid laterally. The examination findings revealed a yellow nodular lesion along the tarsal conjunctiva, which showed amorphous acellular proteinaceous deposits that positively stained with Congo red and exhibited apple-green birefringence under polarized microscopy. These findings suggest the presence of amyloid deposits in the eyelid.

Amyloidosis is a systemic disease characterized by the extracellular deposition of amyloid fibrils in various organs, including the eyelids. It is important to evaluate for systemic involvement in patients with localized amyloidosis to assess for the presence of underlying systemic diseases. Therefore, the next step in the management of this patient would be to order a systemic laboratory workup to evaluate for possible systemic amyloidosis. This workup may include serum and urine protein electrophoresis, serum amyloid A (SAA) level measurement, and genetic testing, among other tests, depending on the suspected etiology of the amyloidosis.

Complete excision or cryotherapy treatment may be considered for localized amyloidosis, but before proceeding with these interventions, it is crucial to determine if there is any underlying systemic involvement. Observation alone without further investigation would not be appropriate in this case, as it is important to assess for potential systemic disease.

C: Retinal detachment repair with vitrectomy and/or scleral buckle

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical findings, including the worsening of visual acuity, presence of vitreous cells, and extensive exudative retinal detachments in both eyes, the patient is experiencing a retinal detachment. Retinal detachment repair is necessary to prevent further visual impairment and permanent vision loss. The most appropriate approach for retinal detachment repair in this case would be vitrectomy and/or scleral buckle surgery. Initiation of immunosuppressive therapy is not indicated based on the given information. Monitoring for resolution of subretinal fluid is not recommended given the severity of the symptoms and the presence of exudative retinal detachments. Surgery to create scleral windows is not the primary treatment for retinal detachment.

C: Mycosis fungoides

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation and histopathological findings described, the most likely diagnosis is mycosis fungoides. Mycosis fungoides is a form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma characterized by the presence of atypical lymphocytes infiltrating the epidermis. The clinical presentation of a solitary, scaly plaque on the lower extremity, along with the histopathological features of epidermotropism of atypical lymphocytes and the presence of Pautrier microabscesses, are consistent with mycosis fungoides.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (A) typically presents with multiple lesions and is characterized by the presence of Langerhans cells, which are not mentioned in the case.

Lymphomatoid contact dermatitis (B) is an unusual variant of allergic contact dermatitis that histologically mimics cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. However, the clinical presentation and histopathological findings described in the case are more consistent with mycosis fungoides.

Pagetoid reticulosis (D), also known as Woringer-Kolopp disease, is a rare variant of mycosis fungoides characterized by a localized, solitary lesion. However, the histopathological findings described in the case, including the presence of atypical lymphocytes and Pautrier microabscesses, are not typically seen in Pagetoid reticulosis.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation and histopathological findings, the most likely diagnosis is mycosis fungoides (C).

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation of asymptomatic hyperpigmentation following the lines of Blaschko on the right side of the trunk, upper arm, and leg, along with palpable slight atrophy of the hyperpigmented skin, the most likely diagnosis is linear atrophoderma of Moulin.

Epidermal nevus (Option A) typically presents as a linear or whorled hyperpigmentation with overgrowth of the epidermis. It is usually present at birth or appears shortly after and is not known to follow the lines of Blaschko.

Lichen striatus (Option C) presents as a linear eruption of papules following the lines of Blaschko, but it does not have hyperpigmentation or atrophy.

Segmental incontinentia pigmenti (Option D) is a rare genetic disorder that typically presents in infancy or early childhood with cutaneous manifestations including vesicles, hyperpigmented streaks, and atrophic patches.

Based on the clinical presentation of asymmetric, centrofacial, erythematous-violaceous indurated telangiectatic and ecchymotic plaques, as well as the patient's history of persistent facial eruption and treatment failure with topical metronidazole and oral doxycycline, the most likely diagnosis is rosacea-like angiosarcoma. This rare variant of angiosarcoma usually occurs in elderly individuals and presents with a violaceous appearance and rapid onset of the eruption. Punch biopsies showing ectatic vascular channels with atypical plump endothelial cells further support this diagnosis. Kaposi sarcoma is typically associated with human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) infection, but immunohistochemistry was negative for HHV-8 in this case. Elder abuse and telangiectatic metastatic carcinoma are less likely diagnoses based on the clinical presentation and histopathologic findings.

D: Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM).

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation described in the case, the patient is a 39-year-old woman with a 3-week history of worsening spasms in her axial and lower limb muscles, new-onset urinary retention, and hyperhidrosis. These symptoms are suggestive of a movement disorder involving both the central and peripheral nervous systems. 

The patient's history of Hashimoto thyroiditis is relevant as autoimmune diseases can be associated with neurological manifestations. The elevated levels of thyroperoxidase antibodies and thyroglobulin antibodies further support an autoimmune process.

Neurological examination findings showed an abnormal mental status, slow saccades, severe hypertonia and rigidity throughout the trunk and all four extremities, as well as myoclonus on tactile and acoustic stimulation. The presence of patella clonus and brisk deep tendon reflexes also indicate central nervous system involvement.

Electromyography (EMG) findings demonstrated continuous firing of normal motor unit potentials at rest within the axial and lower limb muscles, which is characteristic of PERM.

The absence of oligoclonal bands or evidence of infection in cerebrospinal fluid, negative paraneoplastic panel results, and normal imaging studies support the diagnosis of PERM rather than other potential conditions such as progressive myoclonic epilepsies (PMEs), faciobrachial dystonic seizures, or Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD).

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation and diagnostic findings, the most likely diagnosis is Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM).

D: Perform transesophageal echocardiography.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation of a 38-year-old woman with worsening dyspnea, lower extremity edema, a new heart murmur, and elevated brain-type natriuretic peptide levels, further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause.

The physical examination findings of a new heart murmur and the echocardiogram showing severe aortic regurgitation (AR) and a mildly dilated aortic root suggest valvular pathology. Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a valuable diagnostic tool for evaluating valvular pathologies as it provides a detailed visualization of the heart structures and can accurately assess the severity of regurgitation.

Performing blood cultures (option A) may be indicated if infective endocarditis is suspected, but there are no clear indications for its use in this case. Cardiac catheterization (option B) is invasive and provides limited information compared to TEE in evaluating valvular pathology. Repeating the non-ECG-gated computed tomography angiography (option C) may not provide additional diagnostic information since the previous study was inconclusive due to motion artifacts.

A) Provide reassurance, because the patient is no longer taking amiodarone.

**Reasoning**:
The patient's history indicates that he used to take amiodarone but stopped using it 10 months prior to the presentation. The appearance of bilateral corneal verticillata and corneal crystals is a known side effect of amiodarone use. Since the patient is no longer taking amiodarone, it is unlikely that the symptoms are related to the medication. Additionally, there are no other symptoms or findings in the examination that suggest an underlying systemic disorder or infection. Therefore, reassurance is the appropriate next step. Genetic testing, corneal scraping and culture, and laboratory testing for immunoglobulins are not indicated in this case as there is no evidence to suggest a genetic or immunologic cause for the corneal findings.

D: Consult neurosurgery for consideration of drain or shunt placement.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation of severe progressive bilateral vision loss, severe papilledema, and bilateral nonocclusive dural venous sinus thromboses (DVST) seen on magnetic resonance venography, this patient likely has a condition known as idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) with associated DVST. IIH is characterized by increased intracranial pressure, which can lead to optic nerve damage and vision loss.

The patient has already started receiving oral acetazolamide, which is the first-line treatment for IIH. However, in cases of severe papilledema and vision loss, as in this patient, additional interventions may be necessary. One such intervention is the placement of a drain or shunt by neurosurgery.

Serial lumbar punctures may be an option for managing increased intracranial pressure, but they do not directly address the underlying cause of IIH and DVST. Therefore, they are not the most appropriate next step in this case.

Immediate optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF) may be considered in cases of acute vision loss from IIH. However, in this patient with severe papilledema and bilateral nonocclusive DVST, ONSF may not be sufficient to alleviate the underlying cause and should not be the immediate next step.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to consult neurosurgery for consideration of drain or shunt placement to alleviate the elevated intracranial pressure and improve the patient's vision.

Reasoning:
Based on the clinical presentation described, including the 8-month history of a growing, painful tumor on the right buttock, negative findings from colorectal surgical evaluation, and the presence of a verrucous, exophytic tumor with scant yellow drainage, the most likely diagnosis is D: Giant condyloma acuminatum (Buschke-Löwenstein tumor).

Giant condyloma acuminatum is a rare sexually transmitted infection caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), specifically types 6 and 11. It typically presents as a large, exophytic, cauliflower-like tumor in the anogenital region. The tumor can be locally aggressive, causing pain and discomfort. It is characterized histologically by hyperplastic epithelium, ulceration, and a dense inflammatory infiltrate composed of plasma cells, as seen in the hematoxylin-eosin stain image from the incisional biopsy.

Squamous cell carcinoma (A) is a consideration, given the chronicity of the lesion and the potential for malignant transformation in a long-standing HPV infection. However, the histologic findings of the biopsy do not support squamous cell carcinoma.

CD30-positive primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (B) typically presents as nodules or ulcerated plaques, which may be mistaken for infections. However, the clinical presentation and histologic findings described do not support this diagnosis.

Herpes vegetans (C) is an incorrect choice as the patient has a history of genital HSV, but the clinical presentation and histology are not consistent with HSV infection.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is D: Giant condyloma acuminatum (Buschke-Löwenstein tumor).

C) Primary cutaneous aggressive epidermotropic cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell lymphoma. 

**Reasoning**:

Based on the clinical presentation and histopathological findings described in the case, the most likely diagnosis is primary cutaneous aggressive epidermotropic cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell lymphoma. 

The clinical presentation of scaly erythematous patches and plaques without lymphadenopathy is consistent with cutaneous involvement seen in primary cutaneous lymphomas. 

The histopathological findings of an epidermotropic infiltrate of hyperchromatic, convoluted, atypical CD3+, CD4−, and CD8+ lymphocytes with haloed nuclei, basilar tagging, and papillary dermal fibrosis are characteristic of cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell lymphoma. 

Studies of T-cell gene rearrangements identified a clonal population, further supporting the diagnosis. 

Moreover, the development of isolated painful tumors, negative CD30 and CD56, and positive staining for TIA-1, granzymes, and B factor (Bf) 1 are consistent with the aggressive nature of primary cutaneous aggressive epidermotropic cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell lymphoma. 

Therefore, the most appropriate diagnosis for this case is primary cutaneous aggressive epidermotropic cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell lymphoma.

B) Angiosarcoma

**Reasoning**: 
The description of an enlarging, tender, pruritic erythematous patch with central inflammatory papules on the medial forehead is concerning for a vascular tumor. The lack of improvement with treatment for suspected shingles also suggests an alternative diagnosis. The histopathological findings of dissecting vascular channels and spindle cells, along with immunohistochemical staining revealing CD31 and diffuse expression of FLI-1 and ERG, are consistent with the diagnosis of angiosarcoma.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the patient's medical history and examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is B: Acromegaly. 

- The patient has a history of severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) with snoring, daytime fatigue, and migraines.
- Although the patient has been adherent to nightly continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), he still experiences persistent daytime fatigue and morning headaches.
- The patient also reports a change in his bite, from an overbite to an underbite, which has been attributed to dental malocclusion from his CPAP machine.
- Examination findings show macroglossia (enlarged tongue) and tonsillar hypertrophy.
- On further review of systems, the patient reports growth in his tongue and feet and intermittent swelling with numbness in his hands over the past year.

These findings are consistent with the clinical features of acromegaly, which is a rare hormonal disorder characterized by excessive growth hormone production. The enlargement of the tongue (macroglossia) and soft tissues in the oropharynx, along with tonsillar hypertrophy, can contribute to obstructive sleep apnea. The growth in the tongue and feet, as well as the intermittent swelling and numbness in the hands, are also suggestive of acromegaly.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: Acromegaly.

A: Rosai-Dorfman disease

**Reasoning**:

The patient presented with a left-sided neck mass, which persisted despite antibiotic treatment. The CT scan showed an enlarged left-neck level 2B lymph node. The patient had an elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level, indicating an inflammatory response. Studies for various infections were negative.

The ultrasonography-guided needle biopsy, fine-needle aspiration, and flow cytometry had negative results for lymphoproliferative disorders or a malignant condition. The patient underwent a left neck dissection, but intraoperative frozen sections did not show a malignant process.

On final analysis, the pathologic examination of the largest lymph node showed a regressed germinal center with small lymphocytes in mantle zone palisading around the residual germinal centers. This finding is consistent with Rosai-Dorfman disease, also known as sinus histiocytosis with massive lymphadenopathy.

Therefore, the correct diagnosis is A: Rosai-Dorfman disease.

Reasoning: Based on the patient's clinical presentation and findings on examination, the most likely diagnosis is drug-induced uveitis associated with cobimetinib therapy. The patient's symptoms of sudden onset of multiple green spots in both eyes, along with the presence of cream-colored spots on dilated fundus examination, are consistent with previous reports of cobimetinib-associated uveitis. Discontinuation of the breast cancer treatment would be the most appropriate initial step in managing this condition.

B: Obtain an electroretinogram.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the case presentation, the patient is a white teenage boy who presents with bilateral reduced central visual acuity, which is nonprogressive and symmetric. The fundus examination shows bilateral maculopathy with focal areas of gray-brown discoloration. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) reveals disruption of the ellipsoid layer and hyperreflective material extending into the Henle layer. 

Given the patient's history of multiple psychiatric medications, it is important to consider medication-induced maculopathy as a differential diagnosis. Central vision loss in this case can potentially be attributed to medication toxicity. Atomoxetine, quetiapine, and fluoxetine have been associated with possible ocular side effects, such as visual disturbances and macular abnormalities.

To further evaluate the patient, obtaining an electroretinogram (ERG) would be a logical next step. ERG is a useful diagnostic tool that measures the electrical response of the retina to light, allowing assessment of retinal function. It can help differentiate between various causes of maculopathy, including drug-induced toxicity.

Stopping all psychiatric medications (option A) may be considered, but it should be done under the guidance of the patient's psychiatrist to minimize any potential adverse effects and ensure appropriate management of his underlying mental health conditions.

Inquiring about bright light exposures (option C) may be relevant in cases of photoxic maculopathy, but there is no mention of excessive bright light exposure in the case. Furthermore, medication-induced maculopathy is a more likely etiology based on the patient's history.

Prescribing oral steroids (option D) would not be recommended at this stage, as there is no evidence of inflammation or infection in the presentation. Steroid treatment can have its own potential side effects and should be reserved for cases where inflammation or autoimmune processes are suspected.

Therefore, obtaining an electroretinogram (ERG) (option B) would provide valuable information to further assess the retinal function and assist in the diagnosis of the central scotoma in this teenager.

C: Perform orbital debridement.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the patient's presentation and imaging findings, it is likely that he has a fungal infection involving the paranasal sinuses and the right orbital apex. The presence of highly attenuating debris and bony irregularities on noncontrast imaging suggests extensive inflammation and infection. The findings of a pale optic disc in the right eye and severe extraocular movement restriction are consistent with orbital apex involvement.

Systemic antifungal therapy has been initiated, but given the severity and urgency of the infection, urgent surgical nasosinal debridement is necessary to remove the infected tissue and debris. This would help to control the infection and prevent further progression. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be orbital debridement.

Reasoning: The patient's clinical presentation with progressive dyspnea on exertion, weight gain, bibasilar infiltrates on chest radiography, jugular venous distension, and bilateral ground-glass opacities on CT scan all suggest the presence of pulmonary hypertension. Additionally, the presence of right-sided heart failure signs including an irregular rhythm, increased pulmonic closure sound, and severe tricuspid regurgitation support the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension with right-sided heart failure. Given the patient's history of lung adenocarcinoma, the most likely cause of pulmonary hypertension and right-sided heart failure in this case is chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). This suggests that the correct answer is D: Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.

**Reasoning**: Based on the clinical presentation, the patient has new-onset pericardial effusion with signs of cardiac tamponade (elevated jugular venous pressure, distant heart sounds, Kussmaul sign, diastolic right ventricular collapse on echocardiography). This is a medical emergency that requires urgent intervention. 

Option A (Urgent referral for cardiovascular surgery) may be considered if the patient has a suspected or confirmed traumatic cardiac injury or if there is evidence of cardiac rupture. However, in this case, there is no indication of acute trauma or rupture, so this option is not appropriate.

Option B (Pericardiocentesis with pericardial drain placement) is the correct next step. Pericardiocentesis is a life-saving procedure that can relieve cardiac tamponade by draining the accumulated fluid from the pericardial sac. It can be performed urgently at the bedside using echocardiographic guidance.

Option C (Urgent vascular surgery referral for IVC stent removal) is not indicated at this point. The presence of an IVC stent does not explain the pericardial effusion and cardiac tamponade. Procedures such as stent removal should be considered only if there is evidence of IVC obstruction or compression causing clinical symptoms.

Option D (Initiation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and colchicine and observation) is not appropriate in this setting. While these medications may be used in some cases of pericarditis, they are not indicated for the management of pericardial effusion with cardiac tamponade. Immediate pericardiocentesis should be performed.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be pericardiocentesis with pericardial drain placement (Option B).

C: IgG4-related disease

**Reasoning**:

1. The patient presented with progressive odynophagia, hoarseness, and dysphagia, which are symptoms commonly associated with laryngeal pathology.

2. The flexible nasolaryngoscopy revealed erythema and swelling to the right arytenoid, indicating inflammation in the larynx.

3. The initial treatment with doxycycline for presumed infectious supraglottitis did not improve the symptoms, suggesting a non-infectious cause.

4. Repeat flexible nasolaryngoscopy after 6 months showed significant edema of the right arytenoid, indicating disease progression.

5. The biopsy revealed inflammatory disease but was nondiagnostic.

6. Flow cytometry revealed mixed inflammatory infiltrate and an increased plasma cell component, suggesting an autoimmune or inflammatory condition.

7. Stains for infectious organisms were negative, ruling out infectious causes.

8. Further immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the diagnosis, which suggests an immune-related condition.

9. A full-body nuclear magnetic resonance positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan was performed to rule out systemic disease, indicating the suspicion of a systemic condition.

Based on the clinical presentation, biopsy findings, and diagnostic workup, the most likely diagnosis is IgG4-related disease, which is characterized by chronic inflammation, infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells, and fibrosis in affected organs, including the larynx.

B: Inverted papilloma.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the patient's clinical presentation and the description of the nasal septal lesion, there are several key findings that suggest the diagnosis of inverted papilloma:

1. Location: The lesion is located on the right anterior nasal septum, which is a common site for inverted papilloma.
2. Duration: The patient has been experiencing symptoms for 3 years, which is consistent with the chronic nature of inverted papilloma.
3. Symptoms: The patient reports nasal pain, facial pain, and nasal tenderness, which can be seen in cases of inverted papilloma due to mass effect.
4. Physical examination: The lesion is described as submucosal, round, firm, tender, and adherent with a broad base. These characteristics are typical of inverted papilloma.
5. Radiating pain: The patient experiences radiating facial pain, which is a classic symptom of inverted papilloma due to its ability to invade adjacent structures.
6. Lack of resolution with allergy treatment: The patient was prescribed fluticasone and loratadine for allergic rhinitis, but her symptoms did not resolve. This lack of response to treatment suggests a non-allergic etiology, such as inverted papilloma.

Overall, the clinical presentation and findings on examination strongly support the diagnosis of inverted papilloma.

B) Granulomatosis with polyangiitis.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation and findings, the most likely diagnosis is Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), formerly known as Wegener's Granulomatosis. 

1. The patient has a history of asthma, which can be associated with GPA.
2. The presence of obstructive nasal polyps suggests chronic inflammation in the upper respiratory tract, which is a common finding in GPA.
3. The progressive dysphonia and laryngeal masses observed on laryngoscopy are consistent with GPA, which can involve the larynx and cause laryngeal masses.
4. The subglottic stenosis seen on CT is another characteristic feature of GPA, as it can cause inflammation and scarring of the airway.
5. The laryngeal mass biopsy revealing vacuolated macrophages with bacilli and eosinophilic inclusions within plasma cells is also consistent with GPA.

Amyloidosis is not likely in this case as there are no typical signs or symptoms of amyloid deposition and the histopathological findings are not consistent with amyloid deposition.

Rhinoscleroma is a chronic infectious disease caused by Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis, but it typically presents with a nasal obstruction caused by granulomatous inflammation with characteristic Mikulicz cells, which were not mentioned in this case.

Sarcoidosis is characterized by noncaseating granulomas and can affect the upper respiratory tract, but the clinical presentation and findings described in this case are more consistent with GPA. Additionally, sarcoidosis is not typically associated with subglottic stenosis.

C: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation, the patient is a healthy woman in her 60s with a palatal swelling of unknown duration. The swelling is initially noticed by the patient due to its increasing size and not associated with pain or discomfort. The intraoral examination reveals a focally ulcerated, fluctuant submucosal swelling involving almost the entire right side of the hard palatal mucosa and soft palate, terminating at the palatal midline. 

The imaging studies were unremarkable, indicating that there are no obvious abnormalities or lesions seen on the scans.

The incisional biopsy shows fibrous connective tissues infiltrated by inflammatory cells arranged in a diffuse, sheetlike pattern. The cells are characterized by large size, moderate amount of cytoplasm, and round to oval vesicular nuclei with vesicular chromatin and small nucleoli. These cells stain positively with CD45, CD20, CD79, CD21, BCL6, and BCL2 antibodies.

Taken together, these findings are consistent with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. This type of lymphoma is a non-Hodgkin lymphoma that typically presents as a rapidly growing mass, often painless, and can involve various extranodal sites, including the oral cavity. The histological features, immunophenotype, and clinical presentation support the diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in this case.

C: Spontaneous pneumomediastinum.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the patient's symptoms of facial swelling, neck pain, dysphagia, and odynophagia, along with the physical examination findings of a tender, fluctuant pocket of the left neck near the angle of the mandible, the most likely diagnosis is spontaneous pneumomediastinum.

The patient's history of performing a "party trick" involving puffing out his cheeks to force air into his neck suggests that he has been intentionally causing air to enter the subcutaneous tissue of his neck, leading to subcutaneous emphysema. The air then dissects into the mediastinum, causing pneumomediastinum.

Esophageal perforation and necrotizing fasciitis are less likely in this case, as the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are not consistent with these conditions. Pneumoparotid is also unlikely, as it is typically a unilateral condition involving the parotid gland, while this patient has bilateral pneuomparotid.

**Reasoning**:
The patient in this case presentation has a history of corneal opacities and a previous diagnosis of disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection. The slitlamp examination and confocal microscopy findings are consistent with posterior corneal deposits. In order to confirm the diagnosis and determine the nature of these deposits, a descemetorhexis and posterior cornea biopsy would be the appropriate next step. This procedure involves removing a small portion of the cornea to be analyzed under a microscope, which can help identify any specific organisms or other causes of the deposits. Treatment can be tailored based on the biopsy results.

B: Blood testing for infectious and inflammatory agents.

**Reasoning**:
In this case, the patient presents with anterior optic neuropathy characterized by blurry vision, pain in the left eye, and previous episodes of cyclic fevers associated with flulike symptoms. The fundus examination of the left eye shows extensive optic nerve swelling with nerve fiber layer hemorrhage and fluid extending to the macula. The patient's symptoms and findings are suggestive of an inflammatory or infectious etiology.

To further evaluate and identify the underlying cause of the optic neuropathy, blood testing for infectious and inflammatory agents should be performed. This can include testing for markers of systemic inflammation (such as C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate) and specific infectious agents (such as Lyme disease, syphilis, viral infections). These tests will provide valuable information for the diagnosis and subsequent management of the patient.

Magnetic resonance angiography of the neck is not indicated at this point as there are no specific indications or findings suggestive of cervical vascular pathology.

Treatment with oral prednisone may be considered once the underlying cause of the optic neuropathy is identified. However, initiating treatment without a definitive diagnosis may mask or alter the presentation of the disease, making it difficult to establish a correct diagnosis.

Observation alone is not appropriate as the patient's symptoms and findings warrant further investigation to identify the cause of the optic neuropathy and determine appropriate treatment.

Reasoning: Based on the clinical presentation of this patient, there are several important findings to consider. The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes, thyroid cancer, and radiotherapy, which may have contributed to her retinal findings. The retinal pigment abnormalities seen on examination, along with the patient's symptoms of difficulty with night driving and glare, are suggestive of a condition known as cancer-associated retinopathy. Cancer-associated retinopathy is a paraneoplastic syndrome that can occur in patients with a history of cancer and is characterized by retinal pigment abnormalities and visual dysfunction. Given the patient's history of thyroid cancer and radiotherapy, it would be prudent to further investigate this possibility.

B: Administer subtenon corticosteroid injection

**Reasoning**:
Based on the given case, the patient has a history of recurrent left eye redness and photophobia, and has previously been treated with topical corticosteroid therapy, which provided temporary relief of symptoms. Additionally, slitlamp examination of the left eye showed diffuse conjunctival hyperemia, anterior chamber cell, and a vascularized iris infiltrate. Ultrasound biomicroscopy demonstrated ciliary body thickening and a thickened iris pupillary margin. The dilated fundus examination was within normal limits in both eyes.

These findings suggest a possible diagnosis of ocular juvenile xanthogranuloma (JXG), which is a rare benign disorder characterized by yellow nodules or infiltrates in the anterior segment of the eye. It typically affects infants and young children, but can occur in older individuals as well. JXG is usually self-limiting and can resolve spontaneously over time.

In this case, the next step would be to administer subtenon corticosteroid injection. Corticosteroids have anti-inflammatory properties and can help reduce the inflammation and symptoms associated with JXG. The previous temporary relief of symptoms with topical corticosteroid therapy further supports the use of corticosteroids in this case. 

Performing a biopsy of the iris lesion may not be necessary at this point as the clinical presentation and imaging findings are consistent with ocular JXG. Anterior chamber paracentesis for viral polymerase chain reaction is not indicated based on the given information as there is no mention of viral etiology. Screening for antinuclear antibody would not be the most appropriate next step as it would not provide useful information in the context of ocular JXG.

Reasoning: The patient presented with progressive dysphagia to solids, primarily meats, localized retrosternally, and had no other associated symptoms. The EGD showed vertical furrows and circumferential rings in the esophagus, consistent with esophageal rings (also known as Schatzki rings). This finding suggests a structural abnormality in the esophagus that may be causing the dysphagia.

To further evaluate the cause of the dysphagia, the next step would be to perform an esophageal high-resolution manometry (HRM). HRM is a diagnostic test that measures the pressures and contractions in the esophagus, allowing for the evaluation of esophageal motility disorders. This test can help determine if the dysphagia is due to an esophageal motor dysfunction.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: Perform esophageal high-resolution manometry (HRM).

C: Linear IgA dermatosis

**Reasoning**:
Based on the given clinical presentation and findings, the most likely diagnosis is Linear IgA dermatosis.

1. The patient presents with a circular erythematous plaque at the area of median sternotomy, which has been present for 3 months. The lesion consists of multiple concentric annular formations with raised erythematous margins, blisters, and pustules. Some pustules are coalescing into lakes of pus. This description is consistent with the classic "bull's eye" or "target" appearance of Linear IgA dermatosis.

2. The absence of Nikolsky sign suggests that the blistering is subepidermal, which is characteristic of Linear IgA dermatosis.

3. The patient does not report any other symptoms, and the overall physical examination findings are normal. This is consistent with Linear IgA dermatosis, which typically presents with skin involvement without mucosal involvement.

4. Routine laboratory studies, Mantoux test, chest radiography, and chest computed tomography were within the normal range. Negative results on Gram stain, periodic acid-Schiff stain, and tissue culture indicate that there is no evidence of infection.

Given the clinical presentation and findings, Linear IgA dermatosis is the most likely diagnosis.

Reasoning: The presentation of recurrent skin blisters in an infant with accompanying pruritus and redness all over the body suggests a bullous disorder. The absence of oral erosions or difficulty in feeding and normal bowel and bladder movements help narrow down the differential diagnosis. The presence of tense bullae, angulated vesicles, and postinflammatory hypopigmentation with scarring and milia formation favors a diagnosis of bullous mastocytosis.

A) Consider the risk of adverse events and which drugs are approved for use.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the symptoms described in the case, the patient is presenting with first-episode schizophrenia. The symptoms include paranoia, hallucinations, and disordered thinking. It is important to consider the risk of adverse events associated with the available treatment options and also take into account the drugs that are approved for use in this particular condition.

Since the patient is experiencing psychotic symptoms, the most appropriate next step would be to consider the use of antipsychotic medications. Antipsychotic medications are the mainstay of treatment for schizophrenia and have been shown to be effective in reducing psychotic symptoms.

The options given are:
A) Consider the risk of adverse events and which drugs are approved for use.
B) Commence treatment with oral olanzapine.
C) Commence treatment with oral clozapine.
D) Commence cognitive behavioral therapy for psychosis.

Given that the patient is in a first-episode of schizophrenia, it would be prudent to start with a second-generation antipsychotic medication, such as olanzapine, as the first-line treatment. Olanzapine has been approved for use in the treatment of schizophrenia and has shown to be effective in reducing both positive and negative symptoms of the illness.

Therefore, the correct answer is A) Consider the risk of adverse events and which drugs are approved for use.

B: Bone marrow–liver–spleen type of large B-cell lymphoma

**Reasoning**:
- The patient had a history of autoimmune constrictive pericarditis and pleural effusions, which were treated with immunosuppressive drugs. This suggests an underlying immune system dysfunction.
- The patient presented with fever of unknown origin, night sweats, unintentional weight loss, and pancytopenia. These symptoms, along with the increase in ferritin and LDH levels, point towards a hematologic disease.
- CT imaging showed splenomegaly without evidence of metastatic disease or lymph node enlargement. This suggests involvement of the spleen and bone marrow.
- PET-CT imaging showed diffuse hypercaptation in the bone marrow and spleen, indicating advanced bone marrow involvement.
- Bone marrow biopsy showed a diffuse infiltrate of large lymphoid cells with scattered residual hematopoietic elements. Immunostaining was positive for Pax-5, a marker associated with B-cell lymphoma.
- The rapidly evolving sepsis-like syndrome and the patient's death further support the diagnosis of an aggressive hematologic malignancy.
Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is Bone marrow–liver–spleen type of large B-cell lymphoma (Answer B).

B) Ambulatory cardiac monitoring after electrolyte repletion.

**Reasoning**:

The patient in this case presents with wide complex tachycardia, syncope, and electrolyte abnormalities including hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia. The initial treatment with adenosine and electrical cardioversion have temporarily restored sinus rhythm. Given her history of active bulimia and electrolyte derangements, it is important to monitor her cardiac rhythm and investigate any potential underlying mechanisms such as electrolyte imbalances or arrhythmias.

Coronary angiography (A) would not be the first-line investigation in this case as the patient does not have typical symptoms of angina or an acute coronary syndrome. Additionally, the normal echocardiogram makes significant coronary artery disease less likely.

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (C) may be considered in certain cases to evaluate for structural abnormalities or myocarditis. However, it is not the next step in management for this patient. 

An invasive electrophysiology study (D) is typically performed when non-invasive testing has been inconclusive or to guide specific treatment options for arrhythmias. It is not the next step in management for this patient.

Therefore, the next appropriate step in management would be ambulatory cardiac monitoring after electrolyte repletion (B) to investigate for any underlying arrhythmias or possible arrhythmia triggers.

D) Spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma

**Reasoning**:
Based on the patient's clinical history and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is a malignant tumor originating from the left temporal bone. The patient has a history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma and a second primary tumor in the hypopharynx, indicating a predisposition for malignancy. The imaging studies show osseous destruction of the left temporal bone, which is consistent with aggressive tumor growth.

The histopathologic assessment of the excised mass reveals spindle cells that are positive for myogenin, desmin, and CD34. Myogenin is a marker for skeletal muscle differentiation and is rarely expressed in other types of tumors. This, along with the infiltration into fibrous tissue, skeletal muscle, and bone, suggests a diagnosis of spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma.

Malignant fibrous histiocytoma is a possibility, but it typically does not exhibit myogenin positivity. Paraganglioma and squamous cell carcinoma are less likely given the histopathologic findings and lack of their characteristic features.

Therefore, the most appropriate diagnosis for this case is spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma (Choice D).

Reasoning:

Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings described in the case, the most likely diagnosis is B: Thyroglossal duct cyst.

Reasoning:

1. Congenital papule that has been growing proportionally in size since birth: Thyroglossal duct cysts are typically present since birth and may gradually enlarge over time.
2. No associated pain or pruritus: Thyroglossal duct cysts are usually asymptomatic and do not cause pain or itching.
3. Superficial, white-yellow papule on the midline anterior neck: Thyroglossal duct cysts commonly present as midline neck masses, usually above the hyoid bone.
4. Scattered telangiectatic vessels on dermoscopy: This finding is consistent with the vascular supply seen in thyroglossal duct cysts.
5. Ultrasonography showing a superficial cutaneous lesion without deeper involvement or fluid collection: Thyroglossal duct cysts typically involve the superficial layers of the neck and do not extend deeply.
6. Shaving off the lesion for histopathologic evaluation: This procedure is commonly done to obtain a tissue sample for diagnostic confirmation.

Thyroglossal duct cysts are the most likely diagnosis based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings described.

The patient presented with a gradually enlarging right neck mass that persisted despite the resolution of an upper respiratory infection and treatment with antibiotics. The mass was nontender, compressible, and located deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. CT scan showed a fatty-appearing tumor within the right carotid space. Gross and histopathologic examinations revealed uniform univacuolar to multivacuolated granular eosinophilic cells with centrally placed nucleoli, surrounded by a thin, tan, transparent membrane.

**Reasoning**: Given the imaging and histopathologic findings described, the most likely diagnosis is B: Hibernoma. Hibernomas are rare benign tumors composed of brown adipose tissue. They typically present as slow-growing, painless masses that may have a variable consistency. The characteristic imaging findings of a fatty-appearing tumor and histopathologic features of granular eosinophilic cells with small lipid droplets support the diagnosis of hibernoma in this case.

B: Order magnetic resonance imaging of brain and orbits with and without contrast and lumbar puncture.

**Reasoning**:
The sudden loss of vision in this patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia who is receiving induction therapy with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide is concerning for a potential ocular or central nervous system (CNS) complication. Given the bilateral choroidal effusions with diffuse serous retinal detachments, as well as the presence of intraretinal hemorrhages, it is important to rule out any CNS involvement or other causes of vision loss. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits with and without contrast can help evaluate for any CNS pathology, such as intracranial hemorrhage or infiltrative disease. Additionally, a lumbar puncture should be performed to assess for CNS involvement, such as meningeal infiltration or infectious etiologies. Therefore, ordering an MRI of the brain and orbits with and without contrast and a lumbar puncture would be the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient.

MRI with contrast can help evaluate for any space-occupying lesions or intracranial hemorrhage. The lumbar puncture can help assess for central nervous system involvement, such as meningeal infiltration or infectious causes. This step is important in order to rule out any ocular or CNS complications causing the sudden loss of vision.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the presentation of subacute, painless vision loss in the right eye, with anterior chamber inflammation, neovascularization, and granular necrotizing retinitis, along with panretinal occlusive vasculopathy and severe peripheral nonperfusion on fluorescein angiography, the most likely diagnosis is cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis. CMV retinitis is a common opportunistic infection seen in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with HIV infection or undergoing immunosuppressive therapy. In this case, the patient has a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and recent autologous bone marrow transplant, which would be considered a significant immune compromise.

Given the diagnosis of CMV retinitis, the appropriate treatment is to administer intravitreal foscarnet and admit the patient for intravenous acyclovir. Foscarnet is an antiviral medication that directly inhibits CMV replication, and intravitreal administration allows for targeted delivery to the affected eye. Admission for intravenous acyclovir is necessary to provide systemic antiviral coverage and address any potential dissemination of the infection.

There is no indication to administer intravitreal clindamycin in this case, as CMV retinitis is not typically treated with this medication. Additionally, valganciclovir, an oral antiviral used for CMV retinitis, is not appropriate as initial therapy in a patient with active retinitis. Administering an intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor agent followed by panretinal photocoagulation is not indicated as primary treatment for CMV retinitis.

Therefore, the next step in the management of this patient is to administer intravitreal foscarnet and admit for intravenous acyclovir.

B: Perform a complete excisional biopsy of the lesion. 

**Reasoning**: 
In this case, the patient has a rapidly enlarging fleshy nodule on the right nasal conjunctiva with redness, pain, and a foreign body sensation. The lesion did not respond to oral prednisone therapy, raising suspicion of a possible malignant neoplasm. The patient's medical history is significant for CLL/SLL and bladder cancer. 

Given the clinical presentation and history, it is important to obtain a definitive diagnosis by performing a complete excisional biopsy of the lesion. This will allow for histopathological examination of the tissue to determine the nature of the lesion and guide further management. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits may be considered later if there are concerns about intraocular involvement, but obtaining a biopsy should be the next immediate step in the evaluation of this atypical conjunctival lesion.

A) Start topical antibiotics

**Reasoning**:
- The patient presents with infectious keratitis, indicated by the presence of a corneal ulcer on the left eye.
- Bacterial cultures have shown positive results for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli, indicating a bacterial infection.
- Topical antibiotics are the first-line treatment for bacterial keratitis and should be started promptly to control the infection.
- Although the patient has a history of herpes simplex (HSV) keratitis, the viral polymerase chain reaction and potassium hydroxide tests were negative, suggesting that the current infection is not caused by HSV.
- Oral antiviral therapy may be considered if HSV keratitis is confirmed, but it is not indicated in this case.
- Admission for intravenous antiviral therapy is not necessary in the absence of severe systemic infection or complications.

Therefore, the next step would be to start topical antibiotics to treat the bacterial keratitis.

B: Initiate intravenous immunoglobulin therapy 

**Reasoning**:
Given the patient's clinical presentation of fever, diarrhea, weight loss, and protein-losing enteropathy, along with the histologic findings of duodenal mucosal inflammation and lamina propria expansion, the most likely diagnosis is Whipple disease. Whipple disease is a rare chronic infectious disorder caused by Tropheryma whipplei bacteria. It primarily affects the small intestine but can involve other organs as well. The cardinal features of Whipple disease include joint pain, weight loss, and gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and malabsorption.

Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy is the treatment of choice for Whipple disease. IVIG helps to reduce inflammation and improve immune response against the bacteria. Additionally, IVIG can help to alleviate symptoms such as abdominal pain and protein loss in the gut. Antimicrobial therapy, such as antibiotics, is also used in the treatment of Whipple disease, but it is typically combined with IVIG for optimal efficacy.

Performing genetic analysis for evaluation of hematologic malignancy is not indicated in this case as there are no specific indications or findings to suggest hematologic malignancy.

Referring to a nutritionist for education on a gluten-free diet is not appropriate in this case. While celiac disease can present with diarrhea and weight loss, the clinical picture and histologic findings are not consistent with celiac disease. In addition, the patient's symptoms and histologic findings suggest an infectious etiology rather than a gluten-related disorder.

Therefore, the next appropriate step in management would be to initiate intravenous immunoglobulin therapy to treat the underlying Whipple disease.

C: Order polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for Ascaris

**Reasoning**:
The patient in this case presentation is a Pacific Islander woman with fever, abdominal pain, and jaundice. There is also a history of immigration from Chuuk, Micronesia. These findings, along with the imaging showing worms in the biliary tree and the absence of hepatobiliary abnormalities on ultrasound, raise suspicion for biliary ascariasis.

To confirm the diagnosis, it is recommended to order a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for Ascaris. PCR can detect the presence of Ascaris DNA in the patient's samples, providing a definitive diagnosis.

Prescribing anthelminthic therapy alone without confirming the diagnosis could be risky, as these medications may have side effects and may not be effective if the cause of the symptoms is not actually biliary ascariasis.

Prescribing antibiotics before confirming the diagnosis with PCR assay is also not indicated, as the etiology of the symptoms is likely due to Ascaris infection rather than bacterial infection.

Ordering serologic testing for Ascaris is not recommended, as it is less sensitive and specific compared to PCR assays for detecting Ascaris infection.

**Reasoning**: 
Based on the clinical presentation, the 2-day history of burning, stinging, and itchy blisters on the lower lip, and the patient's history of a similar eruption after taking ibuprofen previously, it is likely that the patient is experiencing a case of recurrent herpes labialis (cold sores). 

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to discontinue ibuprofen (Option C). Ibuprofen has been identified as a trigger for this patient's recurrent outbreak, and discontinuing its use may help prevent further episodes. 

Administering valacyclovir (Option A) may be considered in the treatment of herpes labialis, but given the recent onset of symptoms and lack of systemic manifestations in this case, it is not the first-line option at this point. 

Discontinuing all cosmetics (Option B) is not warranted as there is no evidence to suggest their involvement in the outbreak. 

Administering antibiotics (Option D) is not indicated in this case since the presentation is consistent with herpes labialis and there are no signs of bacterial infection.

A) Onchocerciasis

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation and histopathologic findings, the most likely diagnosis is onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness. Onchocerciasis is caused by the parasitic worm Onchocerca volvulus, which is transmitted to humans through the bites of infected blackflies. The patient's residence in a rural village in Malawi, an endemic area for onchocerciasis, is consistent with the diagnosis.

The physical examination findings of a unilateral, itchy nodule on the labium majus, along with obliteration of the labium minus, are characteristic of onchocerciasis. The polypoid, rubbery tumor is likely a result of the inflammatory response to the presence of the parasite.

The histopathologic analysis of the lesional biopsy shows pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia with transepidermal elimination of basophilic oval-shaped structures in the epidermis, which are microfilariae of O. volvulus. The dense acute and chronic dermal infiltrate in the dermis, along with granuloma formation, is consistent with the immune response to the parasite.

Late cutaneous bilharziasis (option B) is unlikely as it is caused by Schistosoma spp., which does not present with the characteristic findings seen in this case.

Periorificial cutaneous tuberculosis (option C) is also unlikely as the clinical presentation and histopathologic findings are not consistent with tuberculosis.

Granuloma inguinale (option D) is caused by Calymmatobacterium granulomatis infection and typically presents with painless genital ulcers rather than the nodule seen in this case.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is onchocerciasis (option A).

Based on the clinical presentation and histopathologic findings described, the most likely diagnosis is C: Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia.

**Reasoning**:
- The patient presented with a pruriginous, reddish nodule on the earlobe, which gradually grew over a 3-month period. This is consistent with the clinical presentation of angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia.
- The lesion appears as a superficial nodule with small dimples, which is characteristic of angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia.
- Histopathologic examination revealed mixed diffuse dermatitis involving the reticular dermis, small-vessel vasculitis, and a mixed leukocytic infiltrate with eosinophils, lymphocytes, and neutrophils affecting the vessel wall. These findings are consistent with angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia.

Therefore, the most appropriate diagnosis for this case is C: Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia.

B: Lung abscess

**Reasoning**:
The patient in the case presented with headache, double vision, seizures, altered consciousness, and facial flushing. On examination, he had ptosis in the right eye and right-medial rectus palsy, grade II papilledema, brisk deep-tendon jerks, and extensor plantar reflexes. The cranial MRI showed ring-enhancing lesions in the right frontal and left parietal lobes with surrounding brain edema and mass effects. Additionally, a chest radiograph revealed a nodular shadow in the left middle lung field.

These findings are consistent with a lung abscess, which can lead to brain abscesses due to hematogenous spread. The presence of a nodular shadow on the chest radiograph suggests an underlying lung infection, and the brain abscesses seen on the MRI are likely the result of septic emboli or direct hematogenous spread from the lung.

The other answer choices (A: Encysted empyema thoracis, C: Pulmonary arteriovenous shunt, and D: Bronchogenic carcinoma) do not account for the patient's neurological symptoms, facial flushing, and the imaging findings of brain abscesses. Therefore, B: Lung abscess is the most likely diagnosis in this case.

C) Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation and findings in this case, the most likely diagnosis is cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). 
1. Clinical Presentation:
   - Painless masses in both Achilles tendons: These are known as tendon xanthomas and are a characteristic feature of CTX.
   - Gradually developed indifference, glassy eyes, lethargy, and poor memory: These symptoms are suggestive of progressive neurological involvement seen in CTX.
   - Dramatic personality change, decreased memory formation, short-temper, irritability, hyperactivity, and slight balance instability: These symptoms are consistent with the central nervous system involvement seen in CTX.

2. Physical Examination Findings:
   - Positive ankle clonus, positive Babinski sign, positive Chaddock sign: These are signs of upper motor neuron involvement, which can be seen in CTX.
   - Positive Romberg sign: This indicates impaired proprioception, which can be seen in CTX.
   - Painless lumps in Achilles tendons: This is consistent with the tendon xanthomas seen in CTX.

3. Laboratory Findings:
   - Elevated triglyceride level: Hypertriglyceridemia is commonly seen in patients with CTX.

4. Imaging Findings:
   - Brain MRI shows multiple bilateral, symmetric abnormal signals in various brain structures, including the internal capsules, cerebral peduncles, pons, and cerebellar dentate nuclei. These findings are characteristic of CTX.
   - Ankle joint MRI shows abnormalities in the Achilles tendons, consistent with tendon xanthomas seen in CTX.

5. Genetic Testing:
   - The presence of a known pathogenic mutation c.1214G>A (p.Arg405Gln; Hom) in the CYP27A1 gene is consistent with the diagnosis of CTX.

Taking all of these factors into consideration, the most likely diagnosis is cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX).

D) Genetic testing for noncompaction.

**Reasoning**:
This patient's presentation is consistent with heart failure, as evidenced by symptoms of dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, and signs of pulmonary vascular congestion on chest radiography. The soft systolic murmur with a brief diastolic component raises suspicion for a ventricular septal defect (VSD) or mitral regurgitation. However, the echocardiogram results revealed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction with no substantial wall motion abnormalities, making these less likely.

The presence of an echogenic band traversing the apical portion of the left ventricle with increased echogenicity compared to the adjacent myocardium is suggestive of noncompaction cardiomyopathy. Noncompaction cardiomyopathy is a genetic disorder characterized by abnormal trabeculations within the left ventricular myocardium, resulting in a spongy appearance. It can lead to heart failure and arrhythmias.

Given the patient's extensive medical history, including hereditary spherocytosis, polycythemia vera, hemochromatosis, and hypereosinophilia, it is important to consider genetic testing for noncompaction as the next step in the workup. Genetic testing can help confirm the diagnosis and determine if there is an underlying genetic mutation responsible for the patient's noncompaction cardiomyopathy.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient would be genetic testing for noncompaction.

B: Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor.

**Reasoning**:

The key findings in this case are:

1. Recurrent vocal fold mass in a middle-aged woman.
2. Previous vocal fold polyp that was removed with benign pathology reported.
3. Subsequent stroboscopy revealed a larger, irregular left vocal fold mass.
4. Preoperative imaging revealed a small soft-tissue density along the true vocal fold.
5. Pathologic results showed spindle-shaped cells with variable atypia, inflammatory cells, myxomatous and fibrous stroma.
6. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed negative staining for desmin, S100, P63, and cytokeratin, but positive staining for vimentin and ALK1.

Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is an inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT). IMT is a rare, benign neoplasm that can occur in various organs, including the larynx. It is characterized by the presence of spindle-shaped myofibroblastic cells, inflammation, and a myxomatous and fibrous stroma. The immunohistochemical staining pattern (negative for desmin, S100, P63, cytokeratin; positive for vimentin and ALK1) is consistent with IMT.

Spindle cell carcinoma (A) is less likely given the benign pathology reported after the previous vocal fold polyp removal and the absence of cytokeratin staining.

Laryngeal granuloma (C) typically presents with localized inflammation and granulation tissue. The clinical history and histopathological findings in this case do not support this diagnosis.

Plasmacytoma of the larynx (D) is unlikely given the absence of plasma cells on histopathological examination.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is an inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (B).

D: Glial heterotopia. 

**Reasoning**: The clinical presentation, imaging findings, and histologic examination are consistent with glial heterotopia. Glial heterotopia is a rare condition where clusters of glial cells are found in abnormal locations outside of the central nervous system, such as the head and neck region. In this case, the posterior neck mass demonstrated irregular borders and infiltration into the paraspinal musculature on imaging. Histologic examination revealed cells with oval nuclei and multiple small nucleoli, surrounded by a pale eosinophilic and slightly fibrillary stroma, which is characteristic of glial tissue. Immunohistochemical studies were positive for glial markers like glial fibrillary acidic protein and vimentin, further supporting the diagnosis of glial heterotopia.

C

**Reasoning**:
Based on the information provided, the patient initially presented with severe head trauma and a right frontal epidural hematoma. The hematoma was surgically evacuated, and the patient showed improvement in the Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) postoperatively. However, on postoperative day 2, the patient developed isolated dysphagia and dysphonia, with laryngoscopic examination revealing right vocal cord paralysis. 

Given the clinical presentation and the imaging findings on computed tomography (CT) with contrast showing thrombosis of the right sigmoid-jugular complex causing compression of the recurrent nerve, the most likely diagnosis is posttraumatic dysphagia with special reference to cerebellopontine angle involvement. This occurs due to compression of the cranial accessory nerve and vagus nerve, resulting from thrombosis at the site of injury.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: Posttraumatic central motor impairment.

C: Kimura disease

**Reasoning**:

Based on the patient's presentation and the findings on physical examination and imaging, the most likely diagnosis is Kimura disease. Kimura disease is a chronic inflammatory disorder characterized by painless subcutaneous masses, most commonly affecting the head and neck region.

The patient's history of a painless, pruritic mass behind the right ear, along with the physical examination findings of a mobile retroauricular mass with excoriations are consistent with Kimura disease.

The laboratory findings of an elevated absolute eosinophil count and eosinophilia percentage further support the diagnosis of Kimura disease. Eosinophilia is a hallmark feature of this disease.

The imaging findings of a heterogeneously enhancing mass in the right retroauricular space, with a tract coursing anteriorly toward the parotid gland, are also consistent with Kimura disease.

The histologic examination of the excised mass shows reactive follicular hyperplasia with prominent eosinophilia, forming eosinophilic microabscesses and follicular cysts. This histologic pattern is characteristic of Kimura disease.

In summary, the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, imaging findings, and histologic examination support the diagnosis of Kimura disease.

D) Repeat the testing for angiotensin-converting enzyme in serum and cerebrospinal fluid.

**Reasoning**: The patient presented with relapsing optic neuropathy and multiple cranial neuropathies, as well as a history of stage IV breast cancer. Initial testing, including imaging and laboratory workup, did not reveal a definitive diagnosis. However, the patient responded to corticosteroids initially, suggesting an autoimmune etiology. Given the lack of clear findings on imaging and initial laboratory testing, it is important to re-evaluate and consider further diagnostic tests.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels are known to be elevated in certain inflammatory and granulomatous diseases, such as sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis can present with optic neuropathy and cranial nerve involvement, and it may also have a relapsing-remitting course. Repeating the ACE testing in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid can help determine if sarcoidosis is a possible underlying cause in this case.

Therefore, the next step would be to repeat the testing for angiotensin-converting enzyme in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (Answer D).

**Reasoning**: The patient presents with recurrent left eye ptosis, erythema, blepharedema, chronic discharge, and knifelike pain. The deep superior conjunctival fornices and pseudomembrane of the tarsal conjunctiva indicate that there may be chronic inflammation and accumulation of secretions in the superior fornix. Sweeping the superior fornix can help remove any accumulated secretions and improve the symptoms. This is a conservative and non-invasive approach that can be attempted before considering more invasive procedures like dacryocystorhinostomy or canaliculotomy. Starting treatment with systemic steroids may carry risks and should be considered only if conservative measures fail.

**Reasoning**: Given the clinical presentation of a black, ulcerated nodule on the upper eyelid margin of an African American woman, along with associated symptoms of erythema, tenderness, discharge, madarosis (loss of eyelashes), eyelid margin notching, and telangiectasia (dilated blood vessels), the most appropriate next step would be to perform a full-thickness eyelid resection with intraoperative control of margins. 

The presence of a pigmented mass with ulceration and other signs is concerning for malignancy, particularly melanoma. Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that can occur on the eyelid, and it commonly presents as a pigmented, nodular lesion that may ulcerate. Surgical excision with adequate margins is the preferred treatment for melanoma to achieve complete removal of the tumor and reduce the risk of recurrence.

Options A, C, and D are not appropriate in this case. Hot compresses and an antibiotic-steroid ointment may be used for infectious or inflammatory conditions, but they would not be effective for a suspected malignancy like melanoma. Incision and drainage is not indicated for a pigmented eyelid lesion, and corticosteroid injection would not address the concern for malignancy.

Therefore, a full-thickness eyelid resection with intraoperative control of margins is the most appropriate next step. This would involve surgically removing the entire lesion along with a small margin of surrounding healthy tissue to ensure complete excision of the tumor. The excised tissue can then be sent for pathological analysis to determine the exact nature of the lesion.

D: Order additional coagulation tests (thrombin time, platelet function assay). 

**Reasoning**: The patient's presentation with fatigue, weakness, arthralgias, peripheral edema, widespread hematomas, ecchymosis, petechiae, and diffuse perifollicular purpura suggests a bleeding disorder. The normal platelet count and normal coagulation tests (PT, APTT) suggest that the bleeding is not due to a deficiency or dysfunction in platelets or the coagulation cascade. The normal liver function tests and normal fibrinogen level also argue against liver dysfunction or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 

Ordering additional coagulation tests, specifically the thrombin time and platelet function assay, can help further evaluate the patient's coagulation profile and pinpoint the underlying cause of the bleeding disorder. This will provide more information to guide appropriate management and treatment.

**Reasoning**:
The patient's POC INR is elevated at 3.7, indicating that the warfarin dosage may be too high. However, before making any dosage adjustments, it is important to rule out any potential causes of the elevated INR. The patient denies any extra warfarin doses, medication changes, dietary nonadherence, or bleeding.

The next step would be to perform a plasma INR test to confirm the POC INR test results. Plasma INR test is considered more accurate and reliable than POC INR tests. If the plasma INR confirms the elevated INR, then dosage adjustments can be considered.

Therefore, the correct answer is D: Perform a plasma INR test to confirm POC INR test results.

C: Switch to intravenous esmolol drip

**Reasoning**:
The patient is experiencing incessant narrow complex tachycardia, which is a sustained abnormally fast heart rate originating from above the ventricles, most commonly involving the atria. The initial treatment attempts with adenosine, metoprolol, and diltiazem did not terminate the arrhythmia. The patient has a positive rapid strep test, indicating an ongoing infection. 

Given the presence of a structurally normal heart and a history of SVT, it is likely that the current tachycardia is related to the patient's underlying condition and may be triggered by the ongoing infection. Intravenous esmolol, a short-acting beta-blocker, is a reasonable next step in managing the tachycardia in this scenario. Beta-blockers can slow the heart rate and decrease conduction through the atrioventricular node, helping to terminate the arrhythmia. Esmolol can be titrated to achieve the desired heart rate response, making it a suitable choice in this situation.

Therefore, the next step would be to switch to intravenous esmolol drip (Answer C).

Reasoning: Given the clinical presentation of coalescent yellowish papules around the umbilicus in a middle-aged woman, along with the dermoscopic findings of curvilinear brown pigment lines and clumped eosinophilic elastic fibers in the biopsy specimen, the most likely diagnosis is Periumbilical pseudoxanthoma elasticum-like papillary dermal elastolysis (B). This condition is characterized by the deposition of abnormal elastic fibers in the papillary dermis and can present with similar clinical and histopathological findings to pseudoxanthoma elasticum, but without systemic involvement. Moreover, the absence of other significant abnormalities on systemic examination and investigations further supports this diagnosis. Elastosis perforans serpiginosa (C) typically presents with pruritic, serpiginous tracks on extensor surfaces and is not typically associated with periumbilical papules. Late-onset focal dermal elastosis (D) is a benign condition characterized by focal accumulation of elastin in the dermis and usually presents with asymptomatic yellow or brown papules. However, the clinical presentation and histopathology in this case are more consistent with Periumbilical pseudoxanthoma elasticum-like papillary dermal elastolysis rather than late-onset focal dermal elastosis. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) Periumbilical pseudoxanthoma elasticum-like papillary dermal elastolysis.

The tests for tumor markers including CA 15-3, carcinoembryonic antigen, CA 19-9, and CA 125 were unremarkable. Breast ultrasonography and mammography did not reveal any parenchymal nodules.

The biopsy of the skin lesion shows a dense dermal infiltrate of cells with focal epidermis involvement and large atypical cells with scanty cytoplasm.

Considering these findings, the most likely diagnosis is Primary cutaneous large B-cell lymphoma, leg type. This type of lymphoma is characterized by cutaneous involvement, typically in the lower extremities, and can present as solitary or localized patches or nodules without systemic symptoms.

C: Chorea-acanthocytosis

**Reasoning**:
Based on the provided clinical presentation and findings, the most likely diagnosis is chorea-acanthocytosis.

1. Clinical Presentation:
The patient has a history of involuntary orofaciolingual movements and vocalizations, as well as dysphagia, dysarthria, and involuntary tongue- and lip-biting. These orofacial dyskinesias worsen while eating. Additionally, the patient exhibits a wide-based gait and mild cognitive decline.

2. Laboratory Findings:
The patient has significantly elevated creatine kinase (CK) levels, which indicate muscle damage. Acanthocytes are also observed in the blood smear, which is characteristic of chorea-acanthocytosis.

3. Neurological Examination:
The patient exhibits orofacial dyskinesia, involuntary vocalizations, mild dysarthria, and diminished or absent deep reflexes. These findings are consistent with chorea-acanthocytosis.

4. Electrophysiological Examination:
Reduced compound muscle action potential and sensory nerve action potential of bilateral median and ulnar nerves, as well as neurogenic damage in lower limb muscles on electromyogram, further support the diagnosis of chorea-acanthocytosis.

5. Imaging Findings:
Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging reveals marked bilateral caudate head atrophy, which is a characteristic feature of chorea-acanthocytosis.

Based on the above information, the most likely diagnosis is chorea-acanthocytosis (Option C).

Reasoning: Given the patient's history of recurrent stroke, it is important to investigate potential causes for the stroke. The abnormal positioning of the ventricular lead on the chest radiography raises suspicion for left ventricular placement, which could be a potential source of thrombus formation and embolization. To confirm the position of the ventricular lead and evaluate for any associated thrombus, a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) would be the next appropriate step in the diagnostic workup.

A) Aqueous humor biopsy for cytometry and biochemical test.

**Reasoning**:
- The patient presents with bilateral vitreous opacity without cells, which is an unusual presentation.
- The patient has a history of vomiting and emaciation, suggesting a possible systemic disorder causing these symptoms.
- There is a family history of liver cancer and vitreous hemorrhage and glaucoma in close relatives.
- The patient has mild anemia, which may indicate an underlying systemic condition.
- Given the atypical presentation and the possibility of an underlying systemic disorder, an aqueous humor biopsy can help in identifying any cellular or biochemical abnormalities that may be contributing to the vitreous opacity. This can guide further diagnostic and management decisions.

B: Obtain orbital imaging.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation and the findings on B-scan ultrasonography, there is a new retro-orbital hypoechoic cavity causing right globe deformation. This finding is concerning and warrants further investigation with orbital imaging. Orbital imaging, such as CT or MRI, can provide more detailed information about the nature and extent of the lesion, helping to identify its origin and determine the appropriate management. Fluorescein angiography and liver biopsy are not indicated in this case as there is no evidence to suggest an ocular vascular abnormality or liver involvement. Monitoring the patient with follow-up in 6 months may not be sufficient for appropriate management and further evaluation of the orbital lesion.

D: Proceed with pars plana vitrectomy and biopsy.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation, the amelanotic choroidal mass in the right eye, overlying subretinal fluid, and the patient's symptoms of blurry vision, further investigation is necessary to determine the nature of the mass. The differential diagnosis includes metastatic tumor, choroidal melanoma, lymphoma, and other inflammatory conditions.
- Investigating for sarcoidosis and tuberculosis would be appropriate, as both can present with ocular manifestations including choroidal masses. If those results are negative, it is still necessary to determine the underlying cause of the mass.
- Treating the mass with radiotherapy without obtaining a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis is not recommended, as the mass could be benign or malignant. It is important to establish a definitive diagnosis before determining the appropriate treatment.
- Referring the patient to a primary care physician for a metastatic workup would not be the first step, as it is important to obtain a tissue sample for pathology before considering the possibility of metastatic disease.
- Proceeding with pars plana vitrectomy and biopsy is the most appropriate next step. This procedure will allow for obtaining a tissue sample for pathological examination, which can provide a definitive diagnosis and guide further management.

B) Subungual squamous cell carcinoma.

**Reasoning**: 
The patient presented with a painful subungual mass of the right thumb for 7 years. The lesion was initially thought to be an infection, but mycological and bacteriological examinations were unremarkable. The patient had no significant medical history or exposure to known risk factors associated with subungual masses. Physical examination revealed a subungual nodule with exudation, crusts, and destruction of the distal nail plate with onycholysis. The lesional biopsy showed proliferation of atypical squamous cells invading the dermis and large atypical squamous cells with hyperchromatic, pleomorphic, and atypical mitosis. These findings are consistent with subungual squamous cell carcinoma, which is a type of skin cancer that can arise in the nail apparatus.

**Reasoning**: The patient's presentation of widespread painful purpura, along with fever, night sweats, fatigue, and clinical and radiologic progression of lymphoma, is concerning for a potential underlying autoimmune or vasculitic process. The recurrences of the purpuric patches after the initial improvement with chemotherapy also suggest an active ongoing process. Given the clinical picture and the presence of purpura, testing for serum cryoglobulin level would be the next appropriate step. Cryoglobulins are immunoglobulins that precipitate at low temperatures and can be associated with cryoglobulinemia vasculitis, which can present with purpura, arthralgias, fatigue, and systemic symptoms. Cryoglobulinemia can be associated with lymphoproliferative disorders like the patient's extranodal marginal zone lymphoma.

Reasoning: 

Based on the clinical presentation of numerous, pink-purple dermal papules on the trunk and extremities, with preference for the extensor surfaces of the arms, along with the presence of polyarticular inflammatory arthritis involving the wrists, metacarpophalangeal joints, and proximal interphalangeal joints, fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, and weight loss, the most likely diagnosis is Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (Option A). Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma typically presents with skin involvement, including pink-purple papules or plaques, and can be associated with systemic symptoms such as arthritis and weight loss. The biopsy results also support this diagnosis, as they show an infiltrate of atypical, irregularly contoured lymphocytes and numerous histiocytes.

Granuloma annulare (Option B) typically presents as erythematous annular plaques without systemic symptoms. The biopsy results of granuloma annulare show a different pattern of a nodular to diffuse lymphohistiocytic infiltrate, not the atypical cells seen in this case.

Small-vessel vasculitis (Option C) would typically present with palpable purpura and systemic symptoms such as fever and arthralgia. The biopsy results of vasculitis show vessel wall inflammation, which is not seen in the provided biopsy images.

Sarcoidosis (Option D) is a systemic disease that can involve the skin, lungs, and other organs. However, the clinical presentation in this case, along with the biopsy results, are more consistent with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (Option A).

**Reasoning**: The clinical presentation of asymptomatic punctate, keratotic papules localized to the palm and finger, with a central dark core, is consistent with the diagnosis of punctate palmoplantar keratoderma (answer B). This is a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by tiny keratotic papules with a distinctive punctate appearance on the palms and soles. The condition typically starts in infancy or early childhood and may persist indefinitely. Other findings such as a positive family history, absence of hair shafts on biopsy, and lack of response to prior treatments support this diagnosis. Porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus (answer A) is characterized by hyperkeratotic papules with a central keratotic plug and epidermal downgrowth, typically appearing in adolescence or adulthood. Familial comedonal Darier disease (answer C) presents with comedonal papules and plaques in a seborrheic distribution, often with a positive family history. Nevus comedonicus (answer D) presents as dilated, keratin-filled follicular openings resembling comedones, typically localized to one area of the body.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis associated with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody (ADEM-MOG).

- The patient presented with progressive neurological symptoms including patchy numbness, incoordination, imbalance, blurred vision, dysphagia, dysarthria, and urinary and bowel urgency.
- The brain MRI showed an enhancing lesion in the brainstem that evolved over time.
- The normal results of blood tests, cerebrospinal fluid examinations, and negative autoimmune and infectious markers suggest a non-inflammatory cause.
- The presence of bilateral optic nerve enhancement and infiltrative soft tissue in the pericardium, intra-atrial septum, and retroperitoneum suggest a systemic disorder.

Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease characterized by granuloma formation, but the clinical presentation and imaging findings do not fit this diagnosis.

Erdheim-Chester disease is a rare non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis that primarily affects the long bones and retroperitoneum. It is not associated with the neurological symptoms described in the case.

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma typically presents with lymphadenopathy, and the brain MRI findings are not consistent with this diagnosis.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis associated with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody (ADEM-MOG).

B: Discontinue metoprolol tartrate and repeat the ambulatory ECG.

**Reasoning**:
The patient's syncope and episodes of high-grade atrioventricular (AV) block (AVB) on ambulatory ECG are concerning for a potential adverse effect of metoprolol tartrate, a beta-blocker commonly used in the management of cardiovascular conditions. Beta-blockers can sometimes cause or worsen AV block, especially in patients with pre-existing conduction abnormalities. Discontinuing metoprolol tartrate is necessary to determine if it is the cause of the AV block and syncope.

Implanting a permanent pacemaker (A) may be considered if AV block persists after discontinuing metoprolol tartrate and causes symptomatic bradycardia. However, it is important to first investigate if metoprolol tartrate is contributing to the AV block before proceeding to pacemaker implantation.

Administering oral theophylline (C) is not indicated in this case. Theophylline is a bronchodilator primarily used in the management of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It has no role in the treatment of AV block or syncope.

Switching ticagrelor to clopidogrel (D) is not necessary based on the information provided. Ticagrelor is a platelet aggregation inhibitor commonly used in patients with acute coronary syndromes, and there is no indication to change the antiplatelet therapy unless there are specific contraindications or intolerance.

Therefore, the next step is to discontinue metoprolol tartrate and repeat the ambulatory ECG to assess for any changes in the AV block and symptoms.

B: Branchial cleft cyst

**Reasoning**:

The patient in this case presented with a right neck mass and intermittent inspiratory stridor, which is consistent with a branchial cleft cyst. Branchial cleft cysts are congenital anomalies that result from a failure of obliteration of the second branchial cleft. They typically present as painless, fluctuant masses located along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The cysts can be associated with respiratory symptoms, such as stridor, especially when they become infected or increase in size.

The presence of facial dysmorphism, including a broad and flat nasal dorsum and mild micrognathia, is characteristic of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. Patients with this syndrome are prone to developing branchial cleft cysts.

The imaging findings of a multispatial mildly enhancing mass within the bilateral retropharyngeal, parapharyngeal, and carotid spaces with convex borders and posterior displacement of the right sternocleidomastoid muscle are consistent with a branchial cleft cyst.

The biopsy results of a polymorphic population of lymphocytes, fibroadipose tissue, and a concentric island of squamous cells with central keratinization further support the diagnosis of a branchial cleft cyst.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is a branchial cleft cyst (Choice B).

B) Quantiferon and rapid plasma reagin tests and chest radiography.

**Reasoning**:
The patient presented with bilateral retinal detachments and had a history of fevers, chills, and coughing. This suggests a systemic infection that may be associated with ocular manifestations. Given the clinical presentation, it is important to rule out infectious etiologies.

The Quantiferon test is used to test for tuberculosis infection, which can present with ocular manifestations such as uveitis and retinal vasculitis. The rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test is used to screen for syphilis, another infectious disease that can cause ocular involvement. Chest radiography is important to evaluate for pulmonary tuberculosis.

Since there are no other findings suggestive of a specific diagnosis at this point, performing these tests will help identify any underlying infectious causes for the patient's symptoms.

A) Recommend systemic corticosteroids.

**Reasoning**:
Based on the clinical presentation of limbus-sparing conjunctival hyperemia, nasal and temporal conjunctival ulceration, and inferior forniceal pseudomembranes, along with the presence of lip blistering and a chest rash, this patient's symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) or a related condition known as toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN). These are severe and potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions.

The management of SJS and TEN includes the immediate discontinuation of the causative medication, in this case, ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Additionally, systemic corticosteroids are commonly used to suppress the immune response and reduce inflammation. The use of topical ophthalmic antibiotics and corticosteroids may provide some symptomatic relief, but it is not the primary treatment for SJS or TEN.

Amniotic membrane transplantation may be considered in severe cases with corneal involvement, but it is not the initial step in management.

Therefore, the appropriate next step in management is to recommend systemic corticosteroids to address the systemic inflammation and provide appropriate support for this patient with suspected Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
