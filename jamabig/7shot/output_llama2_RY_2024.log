**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of intermittent apneic episodes, bilateral rhonchi, and altered mental status, along with the chest radiograph showing 4 radio-opaque coin-shaped opacities in the stomach, suggest a possible foreign body ingestion or aspiration. The patient's history of taking chewable lanthanum tablets increases the likelihood of this diagnosis. It is important to note that lanthanum is a rare earth element that can cause respiratory depression and other adverse effects, especially in high doses.

Therefore, the next step would be to arrange for an endoscopy to visualize the esophagus and stomach and confirm the presence of the foreign bodies. This would also allow for the removal of the objects, if possible.

Sure, I'll do my best to provide a well-structured answer. Here's my reasoning and answer:

**Reasoning**:
The patient presents with a pigmented iris lesion that is shifting with gravity, which suggests that it is likely a cystic lesion. The absence of corneal guttatae or edema suggests that the lesion is not causing significant inflammation or fluid accumulation in the eye. The patient's age and history of sports-related blunt trauma to the eye suggest that the lesion may be a result of a previous injury.

Given these findings, the next step would be to perform a diagnostic test to confirm the nature of the lesion. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy with cytology and cytogenetics (Option A) would be the most appropriate choice, as it would allow for a definitive diagnosis of the lesion and help guide further management.

**Reasoning**:
The patient's symptoms and test results point to a congenital tongue mass that has been present since birth and has grown in proportion to the child's somatic growth. The mass is solid and well-circumscribed, with no cystic components or flow voids, and it demonstrates homogeneous contrast enhancement on T1-weighted imaging. These characteristics are consistent with a diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma, a type of soft tissue sarcoma that arises in the skeletal muscles. Rhabdomyosarcoma typically affects children and young adults, and it can occur in various parts of the body, including the head and neck. The patient's age and the location of the mass in the tongue suggest that rhabdomyosarcoma is a likely diagnosis.

**Reasoning**: The patient's history of a similar episode of rash and delayed wound healing after laparoscopy 1 year prior to presentation, along with the negative bacterial culture result, suggests that the current rash and poor wound healing may be related to an allergic or immune-mediated response rather than a bacterial infection. Additionally, the presence of a papulovesicular rash on the trunk and extremities suggests a possible viral exanthemata, such as herpes zoster or herpes simplex.

**Answer**: B: Prescribe acyclovir (400 mg orally 3 times daily for 7 days). Acyclovir is an antiviral medication that is effective against herpes simplex and herpes zoster viruses. It may help to reduce the severity and duration of the rash, and potentially improve wound healing. It is important to note that a skin biopsy may still be necessary to confirm the diagnosis, but given the patient's history and clinical presentation, starting acyclovir may be a reasonable next step.

**Reasoning**: The patient's history of multiple myeloma complicated by therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia and recent myeloablative conditioning, severe mucositis, acute kidney injury, and neutropenic fever increase the likelihood of invasive fungal infection. The patient's skin lesions, including dusky, purpuric, and pink papulonodules with overlying eschar, are consistent with fungal infection. The negative blood culture result does not rule out invasive fungal infection, as fungi can colonize the skin and mucous membranes without bacteremia. The patient's respiratory symptoms and bilateral ground-glass patchy opacities on chest CT scan suggest possible pulmonary involvement. The presence of septated hyphae and oval microconidia on lactophenol cotton blue staining of a tissue culture colony supports a diagnosis of fungal infection.

**Reasoning**:
The patient presented with a red, protuberant tumor on her right upper arm that had been gradually enlarging over 6 months. The tumor had a firm-to-hard nodule inside and was accompanied by multilocular spaces below the epidermis. The histological examination revealed basophilic cells, shadow cells, and dilated lymphatic vessels.

Based on the patient's history and physical examination, the most likely diagnosis is a pilomatricoma, also known as a calcifying aponeurotic nodule. This is a benign tumor that originates from the hair follicle and is commonly found in children and young adults. The presence of a firm-to-hard nodule inside the tumor and the multilocular spaces below the epidermis are consistent with this diagnosis.

The histological features, such as basophilic cells and shadow cells, are also characteristic of pilomatricoma. Additionally, the presence of dilated lymphatic vessels supports this diagnosis, as pilomatricomas are known to have a rich blood supply.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Answer**: C, Pilomatricoma.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a neurocutaneous syndrome that affects the brain, retina, and other organs. The presence of a retinal astrocytic hamartoma, as suggested by the patient's retinal examination, is a common feature of TSC. Additionally, the patient's history of lightly pigmented patches of skin and subungual fibromas on her toes also supports the diagnosis. Furthermore, the patient's family history of TSC increases the likelihood of this diagnosis.

**Answer**: B: Order brain magnetic resonance imaging to look for associated central nervous system tumors.

It is important to rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a central nervous system tumor, before initiating treatment for TSC. Brain MRI is the appropriate next step in the diagnostic workup to evaluate for any intracranial lesions.

Sure, I can do that. Here's my answer:

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of dysphagia, weight loss, and bibasilar crackles on lung auscultation, along with the maculopapular rash and positive antinuclear antibody immunofluorescent assay findings, suggest a possible diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The patient's history of Raynaud disease and gastroesophageal reflux disease may also be relevant to the patient's overall health and potential treatment plan, but they are not directly related to the likely diagnosis of SLE.

A percutaneous lung tissue biopsy (Option A) may be necessary to confirm a diagnosis of lung involvement in SLE, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management.

Checking an antisynthetase antibody panel (Option B) may be helpful in supporting a diagnosis of SLE, as antisynthetase antibodies are commonly associated with the disease. However, it is not the most urgent step in management at this time.

Performing a quadriceps muscle biopsy (Option C) is not directly related to the patient's current symptoms or likely diagnosis.

Prescribing 10 days of prednisone (60 mg daily) (Option D) is a reasonable first step in management, as corticosteroids are commonly used to treat SLE flares. However, the dosing and duration of corticosteroid therapy may need to be adjusted based on the patient's response to treatment and any potential side effects.

Therefore, the best answer is:

**Answer**: D. Prescribe 10 days of prednisone (60 mg daily).

**Reasoning**: The patient's history of a gradually growing mass on the left shoulder, along with the physical examination findings of a large, fungating, necrotic, and ulcerated mass, suggests a diagnosis of a malignant skin tumor. The patient's occupation as a construction worker and daily tobacco use may also be relevant to the patient's overall health and potential treatment plan, but they are not directly related to the likely diagnosis. The punch biopsy results showing sheets of highly pleomorphic atypical spindle and epithelial cells within the superficial and deep dermis, extending into the subcutaneous tissue, and with 18 mitoses/mm2, further support the diagnosis of a malignant skin tumor. The immunohistochemistry results demonstrating SOX10-positive and pankeratin-negative tumor cells are also consistent with this diagnosis. Finally, the whole-body PET-CT scan revealing an intensely hypermetabolic left shoulder mass and multiple hypermetabolic enlarged left axillary lymph nodes, with no distant metastases, suggests that the tumor is likely confined to the left shoulder and axilla.

**Answer**: A: Squamous cell carcinoma.

**Reasoning**: The patient presents with worsening vision and symptoms consistent with retinal vasculitis and vitritis, with negative vitreous biopsy cytology for malignant cells. The patient has a history of B-cell lymphoma and active renal cell carcinoma, and is receiving cabozantinib therapy. The patient's recent outside retinal detachment repair and initiation of cabozantinib therapy suggest a possible association between the drug and the retinal findings.

The patient's vision loss and vasculitis require prompt intervention. Given the negative vitreous biopsy cytology, it is reasonable to consider a diagnosis of retinal vasculitis associated with cabozantinib therapy.

**Answer**: B: Stop prednisone and proceed with diagnostic vitrectomy.

A diagnostic vitrectomy would allow for a more thorough evaluation of the retinal tissue and potential identification of the causative agent, while also providing therapeutic benefit by removing inflammatory cells and reducing vitreous traction. Stopping prednisone would allow for better visualization during surgery and reduce the risk of steroid-induced cataracts. Cabozantinib therapy should be stopped given the possible association with retinal vasculitis. Intravenous solumedrol may be considered after surgery for further immunosuppression, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management. Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits and lumbar puncture may be considered to evaluate for any associated central nervous system involvement, but they are not the most urgent steps in management.

Sure, I'll do my best to provide a well-structured answer. Here's my reasoning and answer:

**Reasoning**:
The patient's symptoms of left shoulder pain, stiffness, and reduced range of motion, along with the presence of a well-demarcated smooth osseous margin of the proximal humerus and associated soft tissue swelling and periarticular calcification on the left shoulder radiograph, suggest a possible diagnosis of a destructive lesion of the left humeral head. The patient's history of thoracolumbar scoliosis, poor mobility, and frequent falls increase the likelihood of a pathological fracture or bone destruction. The absence of any recent trauma and the patient's history of syringomyelia suggest that the lesion may be a manifestation of a chronic condition.

**Answer**: C: Orthopedic surgery evaluation for shoulder replacement surgery.

The patient's symptoms and radiographic findings indicate a severe destructive lesion of the left humeral head, which may require surgical intervention. An orthopedic surgery evaluation would help determine the best course of treatment, including the possibility of shoulder replacement surgery. This would be the most appropriate next step in the patient's management.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with a diagnosis of VEXAS syndrome, which is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by the presence of edematous, erythematous plaques on the skin, mild leukopenia, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The patient's history of treatment with hydroxychloroquine and mycophenolate mofetil, which are commonly used to treat autoimmune disorders, supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's negative antinuclear antibody screening results and normal complement levels suggest that the patient does not have systemic lupus erythematosus, which is a more common autoimmune disorder that can present with similar symptoms.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms, including skin lesions, numbness, and hand contractures, are consistent with Hansen's disease, also known as leprosy. The patient's recent immigration from Samoa, where Hansen's disease is endemic, increases the likelihood of this diagnosis. The negative rapid plasma reagin, antinuclear antibodies, and rheumatoid factor test results suggest that the patient does not have syphilis, lupus, or rheumatoid arthritis, which can present with similar symptoms. The granulomatous periadnexal and perivascular dermatitis with diffuse granulomatous infiltrate and foamy histiocytes observed in the skin biopsy are consistent with Hansen's disease. Therefore, it is important to confirm the diagnosis with further testing.

**Answer**: B: Obtain serologic testing for M leprae phenolic glycolipid 1. This test can confirm the presence of antibodies against M. leprae in the patient's blood, which would support the diagnosis of Hansen's disease.

Sure, I can do that. Here's my answer:

**Reasoning**: The patient's presentation of chest pain, shortness of breath, and bilateral lower extremity numbness, along with the electrocardiogram (ECG) findings of left anterior fascicular block and down-sloping anterolateral ST segments, suggest a possible diagnosis of coronary artery disease or cardiac ischemia. However, the patient's history of lumbar spinal stenosis and unintended weight loss of 8 kg over 6 months also suggest a possible diagnosis of neuropathy. The patient's laboratory results, including a high-sensitivity troponin level of 52 ng/L and brain-type natriuretic peptide level of 112 pmol/L, support the diagnosis of cardiac dysfunction. The patient's bone scintigraphy scan using technetium Tc 99mâlabeled hydroxymethylene diphosphonate demonstrated increased cardiac uptake, which is consistent with cardiac amyloidosis. Therefore, the next step would be to perform a bone marrow biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis.

Sure, I'll do my best to help you with that! Here's my reasoning and answer:

**Reasoning**:
The patient's symptoms of diminution of vision, progressive redness, and dull aching pain in the right eye, along with the physical examination findings of dilated corkscrew conjunctival vessels, shallow anterior chamber, and serous choroidal detachment, suggest a possible diagnosis of ocular inflammation. The presence of nuclear cataract in both eyes and shallow detachment all around in the right eye also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's age and lack of any significant medical history suggest that the inflammation is likely to be related to an underlying systemic condition.

**Answer**: B: Uveitis workup and steroids.

I choose this answer because the patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with uveitis, which is a type of ocular inflammation that can be caused by a variety of systemic conditions. Performing a uveitis workup, including laboratory tests and imaging studies, can help identify the underlying cause of the inflammation and guide treatment. Steroids may also be prescribed to reduce inflammation and prevent further damage to the eye.

Sure, I'll do my best to help you with that! Here's my reasoning and answer:

**Reasoning**: Based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings, it is likely that the sudden decrease in visual acuity is caused by a reverse pupillary block, which can lead to acute angle closure glaucoma. The deepening of the anterior chamber and backbowing of the iris are also consistent with this diagnosis. Intraocular pressure measurement confirms the presence of glaucoma. The inferior retinal detachment without any associated visible tear suggests that the patient may have had a previous retinal tear or hole that has since sealed off, leading to a serous retinal detachment.

**Answer**: C: Administer intravenous corticosteroids. The first step in managing this patient's condition would be to administer intravenous corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and prevent further progression of the disease. Peripheral iridotomy (Option A) may be necessary later on to prevent further episodes of angle closure, but it is not the most urgent step. Full-thickness sclerectomy (Option B) is not typically performed for acute angle closure glaucoma. Combined phacoemulsification-vitrectomy surgery (Option D) may be necessary in the future, but it is not the most appropriate immediate step.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of decreased visual acuity, bilateral panuveitis, and pigmentary abnormalities on fundus examination are concerning for a possible inflammatory or infectious etiology. The history of melanoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia increases the likelihood of an underlying systemic condition affecting the eyes. The recent exposure to nivolumab and obinutuzumab, immune checkpoint inhibitors, raises the possibility of an immune-related adverse event. The negative results of repeat testing for Treponema pallidum, Lyme disease, and HIV suggest that an opportunistic infection is less likely. The patient's previous treatment with oral prednisone and the planned taper may have contributed to the resolution of the active anterior and vitreous cells. However, the recurrence of symptoms and pigmentary abnormalities warrants further investigation and intervention.

**Answer**: B: Pars plana vitrectomy for vitreous biopsy with or without chorioretinal biopsy for flow cytometry to assess for leukemic cells. This answer choice allows for the evaluation of the vitreous and retinal tissue for malignant cells, which may help establish a diagnosis and guide further management. It is a relatively low-risk procedure that can provide valuable diagnostic information. The decision to perform a pars plana vitrectomy should be made in consultation with a vitreoretinal specialist.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of left-sided facial weakness and swelling, along with the physical examination findings of left lower-motor-neuron type of facial nerve palsy, suggest a neurological disorder. The patient's history of recurrent high-grade serous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary and recent chemotherapy treatment increase the likelihood of a metastatic lesion. The MRI findings of mucosal thickening and bony destruction in the maxillary sinuses, along with enhancement of the facial nerve and involvement of the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve, are consistent with perineural extension of disease. The absence of any neuroparenchymal or meningeal lesions on MRI suggests that the neurological symptoms are likely due to compression or infiltration of the facial nerve by the tumor.

**Reasoning**: The patient presented with an asymptomatic nodule on the midline dorsal tongue, which was firm to palpation and nontender. The surrounding oral soft tissue was unremarkable. The histopathology revealed acellular, amorphous, and eosinophilic material arranged in lobules in the connective tissue.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of median rhomboid glossitis (nodular variant). Median rhomboid glossitis is a rare benign condition that affects the tongue, characterized by the presence of a nodule or papule on the midline of the tongue. It is usually asymptomatic and discovered incidentally during routine dental examinations. The nodule is typically firm and nontender, and the surrounding tissue is normal. The histopathology shows acellular, amorphous, and eosinophilic material arranged in lobules, which is consistent with the diagnosis.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with pemphigus foliaceus, a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the skin and mucous membranes. The presence of waxy, exfoliative scale on the palms and soles, and ectropion are characteristic features of this condition. The patient's history of no recent viral or bacterial infection, absence of fever, and normal complete blood cell count and lactate dehydrogenase level also support this diagnosis.

To confirm the diagnosis, it would be appropriate to perform a skin biopsy with T-cell clonality studies. This would help to identify the presence of autoantibodies against desmoglein 1 and/or desmoglein 3, which are hallmarks of pemphigus foliaceus.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms and signs of bilateral blurry vision, eye redness, discharge, photophobia, and pain, along with the physical examination findings of chemosis, conjunctival hyperemia, microcystic corneal edema, and hypopyon, are concerning for endophthalmitis. The patient's recent chemotherapy and removal of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) increase the likelihood of bacterial endophthalmitis. The patient's history of Leber congenital amaurosis treated with voretigene neparvovec gene therapy and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) also increase the risk of infection.

**Answer**: C: Obtain a sample of the hypopyon through anterior chamber paracentesis and inject intravitreal antibiotics.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of alternating vertical and torsional nystagmus, along with the absence of any family history of ocular disease, suggest a possible underlying neurological cause. The presence of other neurological symptoms such as mild cognitive impairment, low tone, and increased reflexes also support this possibility. Furthermore, the normal appearance of the optic nerve and foveal reflexes suggests that the issue is unlikely to be related to a problem with the eyes themselves.

**Answer**: A: Review brain MRI and order electroretinogram.
This answer choice is the most appropriate next step in the evaluation of this patient. Reviewing the brain MRI can help to identify any potential issues with the brain that may be contributing to the nystagmus, while an electroretinogram (ERG) can help to assess the function of the retina and determine if there is any abnormal activity that may be contributing to the nystagmus.

**Reasoning**: The patient's history of myelodysplastic syndrome, isolated deletion 5q (del5q), and recent onset of nonhealing skin ulcers on the chest and upper extremities, along with the absence of circulating blasts in the blood, suggests a diagnosis of leukemia cutis. The patient's treatment with lenalidomide, which has been associated with the development of leukemia cutis, supports this diagnosis. The presence of a dense dermal infiltrate with predominantly neutrophils, reactive histiocytes, fibroblasts, and angioplasia, as well as the absence of immature myeloid precursors, is consistent with leukemia cutis. Additionally, the patient's negative blood cultures and lack of other significant adverse effects suggest that the skin lesions are not due to a bacterial infection or other condition.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a possible diagnosis of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) in the left eye, which is supported by the presence of a relative afferent pupillary defect and an inferior visual field defect. The patient's history of kidney transplantation and immunosuppressive medication use increases the likelihood of this diagnosis. Additionally, the abnormal appearance of the optic discs, particularly the central excavation in the left eye, is consistent with NAION.

**Answer**: A: Cranial magnetic resonance imaging.

This answer choice is appropriate because MRI can help confirm the diagnosis of NAION by identifying any damage to the optic nerve and surrounding tissues. It can also help rule out other potential causes of visual changes, such as a tumor or inflammation. Therefore, cranial MRI is a reasonable next step in the patient's evaluation.

The patient's age and lack of triggers such as local infection, insect bite, or trauma also support this diagnosis. The irregular borders and purple color of the lesions, as well as the absence of extracutaneous involvement, are also consistent with Kaposi sarcoma.

The histopathological examination reveals irregularly branched, thin-walled blood vessels dissecting through collagen bundles within the superficial to mid dermis, which is consistent with the characteristic "sponge-like" appearance of Kaposi sarcoma. Additionally, the presence of plump endothelial cells dispersed between thickened collagen bundles without signs of atypia supports this diagnosis. The positive staining of endothelial cells for CD31 further supports the diagnosis of Kaposi sarcoma.

**Reasoning**:
The patient presented with a slowly growing, asymptomatic lump on his left lower neck since birth. The physical examination revealed a yellowish, hump-like mass with a hairy surface and cartilage-like consistency on the anterior border of the lower third of the left sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM). The ultrasonography and MRI results showed a hypoechoic, avascular, bulging nodule with an anechoic tubular structure extending to the subcutaneous fat and reaching the surface of the muscular layer. The neck mass was completely excised, and the histopathological analysis showed normal-appearing epidermis, multiple pilosebaceous follicles, abundant adipose tissue, and two centrally circumscribed segments of cartilage in the subcutis.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, imaging results, and histopathological analysis, the most likely diagnosis is Cervical chondrocutaneous branchial remnant. This is a rare congenital anomaly that occurs when there is a failure of obliteration of the branchial cleft during embryonic development. The cartilage and adipose tissue in the subcutis, along with the hairy surface and the location of the mass on the anterior border of the SCM, support this diagnosis.

**Reasoning**: The patient presented with a slowly enlarging, painless neck mass, with no other symptoms or significant medical history. The mass was firm, fixed, and well-circumscribed, with no overlying skin changes or cutaneous involvement. The patient underwent imaging studies, including ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging, which demonstrated a hypoechoic mass with contrast enhancement. The patient also underwent fine-needle aspiration and core-needle biopsy, but the results were inconclusive. The patient then underwent surgical excision of the mass, and pathology revealed a well-circumscribed lesion with peripheral bone casing, cyst-like spaces filled with serous fluid, and walls of spindle-shaped fibroblasts, osteoclast-type giant cells, thin trabeculae of woven bone surfaced with osteoblasts, and scattered macrophages. The lesion was positive for USP6 locus rearrangement (17p13.2) on florescence in situ hybridization.

Based on the patient's symptoms and imaging studies, the most likely diagnosis is a soft tissue giant cell tumor. This diagnosis is supported by the patient's age, the slow growth of the mass, and the absence of other symptoms. The pathology results also support this diagnosis, as the lesion demonstrated peripheral bone casing, cyst-like spaces, and the presence of osteoclast-type giant cells, which are all characteristic features of soft tissue giant cell tumors. Additionally, the USP6 locus rearrangement (17p13.2) is a genetic alteration commonly found in soft tissue giant cell tumors.

**Reasoning**: The patient's presentation of spontaneous blistering on the right lower extremity, hyperpigmented macules, and patches on the anterior lower legs, and tense bullae on the anterior aspect of the right lower extremity, dorsal foot surface, and toes, are consistent with diabetic dermopathy. Diabetic dermopathy is a skin condition that occurs in patients with diabetes and is associated with poor blood sugar control. The patient's history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and gastroparesis, as well as the presence of anemia, also support this diagnosis.

To confirm the diagnosis, it would be appropriate to perform a skin biopsy for histopathology and direct immunofluorescence. This will allow for a closer examination of the skin tissue and will help to rule out other potential skin conditions.

Aspirating the bullae with a sterile needle and covering with a clean dressing may provide some symptomatic relief, but it will not confirm the diagnosis or address the underlying cause of the blisters. Starting oral prednisone may help to reduce inflammation, but it is not the most appropriate step in this case. Treating with oral cephalexin for 7 days may be appropriate if there is a concern for a bacterial infection, but it is not the most likely diagnosis given the patient's history and physical examination findings.

**Answer**: B: Perform a skin biopsy for histopathology and direct immunofluorescence.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of sudden painless vision loss, afferent pupillary defect, and retinal pallor with a cherry red spot on fundus examination suggest a possible diagnosis of monocular vision loss due to retinal artery occlusion. The patient's history of ear pain, nasal congestion, and night sweats suggest a possible underlying infectious or inflammatory condition. The patient's recent weight loss and leukocytosis on blood tests also support this possibility. Therefore, it is important to investigate further for potential causes of retinal artery occlusion, such as a vasculitis or a retinal embolism.

**Answer**: A: Request a magnetic resonance image of orbits and sinuses. This will help to evaluate the extent of any potential vasculitis or inflammation in the orbit and sinuses, which may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. Additionally, MRI can help to identify any retinal emboli or other structural abnormalities that may be causing the patient's vision loss.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of acute chest pain and respiratory insufficiency suggest a possible infectious etiology, such as bacterial endocarditis or pneumonia. The patient's recent use of acetazolamide, which can cause a drop in blood pH, may have contributed to the development of these symptoms. Additionally, the patient's history of hypertension and diabetes increases the likelihood of cardiovascular disease.

Therefore, it is important to obtain blood cultures to diagnose any potential bacterial infections and to perform a vitreous tap to assess for any intraocular infection. Injecting antibiotics intravitreally may also be considered to treat any potential infection.

**Reasoning**: 
1. The patient's symptoms of intermittent stridor, which worsened over time and occurred even during sleep and rest, suggest an obstructive process in the upper airway.
2. The mass in the distal cervical trachea, as revealed by in-office flexible videostroboscopy and chest radiography, supports the diagnosis of an intratracheal mass.
3. The exophytic, pedunculated nature of the mass and its attachment to the anterior wall of the cervical trachea, as seen during direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy, suggest a benign tumor.
4. The patient's age and the location of the mass in the trachea make it unlikely for the mass to be a chondroma or a glomus tumor.
5. Schwannomas are rare in the trachea, and the patient's symptoms and the mass's appearance do not support this diagnosis.

**Reasoning**:
The patient's history of multiple painless scalp nodules since childhood, along with the presence of subcutaneous nodules on the hands, feet, trunk, and lower extremities, suggests a congenital or inherited condition. The patient's consanguineous parents and lack of similar symptoms in other family members support this notion. The patient's age and the gradual increase in size and number of the tumors over time also suggest a condition that typically presents in childhood or adolescence.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with several possible diagnoses, including infantile myofibromatosis, Mafucci syndrome, lipoid proteinosis, and juvenile hyaline fibromatosis. However, based on the patient's history and physical examination, the most likely diagnosis is juvenile hyaline fibromatosis.

Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis is a rare benign tumor that typically presents in childhood or adolescence. It is characterized by the presence of multiple painless subcutaneous nodules, usually on the scalp, face, and extremities. The nodules are typically small and have a firm, smooth surface. The condition is often associated with a family history of similar symptoms, and the tumors tend to increase in size and number over time.

The patient's history of recurrent subcutaneous masses that have increased in size and number over time, along with the presence of hard, smooth nodules on the scalp and other parts of the body, is consistent with juvenile hyaline fibromatosis. The patient's lack of tenderness, swelling, or other skin manifestations also supports this diagnosis.

Sure, I'll do my best to help you with that!

Here's my reasoning:

The patient's sudden onset of dyspnea and retrosternal chest pain during the procedure suggests a possible complication related to the catheterization. The most likely cause is a thrombus formation in the pulmonary vein or left atrium, which could be obstructing blood flow and causing the patient's symptoms.

Therefore, my answer is:

**Answer**: C: Catheter-directed thromboembolectomy.

This procedure involves using a catheter to remove the thrombus and restore blood flow to the affected area. It's a minimally invasive procedure that can be performed during the same session as the balloon mitral valvotomy, and it has a high success rate in resolving the issue.

I hope that helps! What do you think?

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of orbital swelling, eye pain, blurry vision, and bilateral photophobia, along with the physical examination findings of chemosis, injected conjunctiva, and periorbital edema, are consistent with orbital inflammation. The patient's history of hypertension, poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, tobacco use, and asthma increases the likelihood of a systemic inflammatory disorder. The patient's family history of chronic orbital swelling in her brother and father suggests a possible genetic component. The imaging findings of bilateral ethmoid and frontal sinus opacification and right worse than left orbital fat stranding, along with the elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, total IgG, and IgG4 levels, support the diagnosis of IgG4-related disease. The absence of fungal infection or necrosis on orbital biopsy and the presence of nodular lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates separated by thick collagen bundles, are also consistent with IgG4-related disease.

**Reasoning**:
After analyzing the given clinical case, I have come to the conclusion that the most likely diagnosis is option B: Hemosiderotic fibrolipomatous tumor.

The patient's symptoms of a painful bruise on her hand that has persisted for two years, along with the physical examination findings of an ill-defined indurated blue-green plaque on the dorsum of the hand, suggest a soft tissue tumor. The radiography results showing soft tissue swelling and the magnetic resonance imaging findings of a heterogeneously fluid hyperintense and T1 heterogeneously hyperintense lesion centered within the dorsal subcutaneous soft tissue of the hand further support this diagnosis.

Hemosiderotic fibrolipomatous tumor is a rare benign soft tissue tumor that typically presents as a slowly growing mass in the soft tissues of the extremities. It is characterized by the presence of hemosiderin-laden macrophages and a variable number of fibrolipomatous cells. The tumor often has a blue or green discoloration due to the presence of hemosiderin, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

While pigmented epithelioid melanocytoma (option A) and pigmented dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (option C) are also possible diagnoses, they are less likely given the patient's age and the absence of a personal or family history of bleeding disorders. Angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma (option D) is a rare soft tissue tumor that typically affects the skin and subcutaneous tissue, but it is not typically associated with a blue or green discoloration.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, as well as the radiography and magnetic resonance imaging results, the most likely diagnosis is option B: Hemosiderotic fibrolipomatous tumor.

**Answer**: B

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of severe neck pain, electric shock-like numbness, and pustules on the palms, along with the abnormal MRI findings, suggest a possible diagnosis of synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome. SAPHO syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the joints and bones, causing inflammation and formation of pustules on the skin. It is often associated with inflammatory arthritis and can mimic other conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or infection. The patient's history of recent onset of neck pain and stiffness, followed by the development of pustules on the palms, supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the negative results of workup for rheumatic and infectious diseases, including antinuclear, antineutrophil cytoplasmic, and anticardiolipin antibodies, human leukocyte antigen B27, and repeated blood cultures, suggest that the patient's condition is not caused by an infection or autoimmune disorder.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of a rapidly progressing rash and swelling of the left side of the chest wall, along with the physical examination findings of bilateral gynecomastia and inverted left nipple, are concerning for a malignancy. The patient's history of receiving the second dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Moderna) shortly before the onset of symptoms raises the possibility of a vaccine-related adverse event. However, the patient's age and history of metabolic syndrome also suggest a possible diagnosis of a chronic skin condition. The punch biopsy results showing a diffuse island of atypical cells in the dermis and the immunohistochemical staining results (CK-7, GATA-3, and PAX-8 positive; ER/PR negative; TTF-1, SATB-2, CDX-2, and NKX-3.1 negative) support a diagnosis of a carcinoma. The positron emission tomographyâcomputed tomography scan findings of a diffuse, infiltrating fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid cutaneous lesion on the left chest wall and multiple FDG-avid nodes in the axilla, left internal mammary, and left cervical chain suggest a diagnosis of an aggressive malignancy. The core biopsy from the lymph node showing a similar pattern of atypical cells as the punch biopsy supports this diagnosis.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms and imaging findings are consistent with a large bilateral compressible neck mass. The patient's history of a similar mass that was treated with liposuction 10 years prior, as well as the absence of any neurological deficits, suggest that the mass is likely benign. The patient's history of hypertension, coronary artery disease, and obstructive sleep apnea may also suggest a possible diagnosis of Madelung disease, which is a rare benign tumor that occurs in the neck and is associated with these conditions. However, the patient's family history and social history do not support this diagnosis. The patient's age and the fact that the mass has been growing over time also make liposarcoma a possible diagnosis. Familial lipomatosis and drug-induced lipomatosis are less likely given the patient's history.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of progressive camptocormia, head drop, and dysphagia, along with the physical examination findings of muscle wasting and weakness, suggest a myopathic process. The patient's history of thyroid cancer and chronic left accessory nerve injury increase the likelihood of a paraneoplastic myositis. Additionally, the low-positive Mi2 antibodies and small IgG Îº paraprotein found in the patient's serum suggest an autoimmune component to the myopathy. The patient's age and absence of a family history make late-onset Pompe disease less likely. Myasthenia gravis is unlikely given the absence of symptoms such as diplopia, ptosis, or weakness in the face, arms, or legs.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of loud snoring, infrequent abrupt awakenings with a sensation of breathlessness, and fatigue are consistent with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The patient's history of hypertension and epilepsy also increases the likelihood of OSA. The home sleep test results show a high apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 32.8 events per hour, which supports the diagnosis of OSA.

**Answer**: B: Initiate continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy.

CPAP therapy is the standard treatment for OSA, and it is effective in reducing symptoms and improving quality of life. The patient's high AHI and symptoms indicate that she is likely to benefit from CPAP therapy. It is important to note that while a wedge pillow may help alleviate symptoms, it is not a substitute for definitive treatment with CPAP. Laboratory-based polysomnography may be necessary if the patient does not respond to CPAP therapy or if there are concerns about other sleep disorders. Repeating the home sleep apnea test may be unnecessary given the clear indication for CPAP therapy based on the patient's symptoms and home sleep test results.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of severe physical exhaustion, syncopal episodes, dysphagia, and sinus congestion, along with the finding of diffuse facial edema and erythema without proptosis, suggest a systemic inflammatory response. The presence of mild chemosis and hyperemia in both eyes and a patent Baerveldt tube ostium in the midanterior chamber with normal bleb morphology without a tense capsule, suggest that the inflammation is not related to the tube shunt. The 24-2 Humphrey visual field showed new glaucoma progression in the left eye, indicating that the patient's glaucoma is not well-controlled.

The patient's history of severe primary open-angle glaucoma, elevated IOP in response to topical corticosteroids, and mild chronic macular edema in both eyes after remote cataract surgery and vitrectomy with membrane peel, suggest that the patient may benefit from additional glaucoma surgery.

However, before proceeding with additional surgery, it is important to investigate the cause of the patient's systemic inflammatory response, as it could be related to a concurrent medical condition that needs to be addressed.

Therefore, the next step would be to perform a systemic workup, including chest imaging, to identify the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

**Reasoning**: The patient presents with progressive hair loss starting at the age of 1 year, with short, sparse, lanugolike hair on the scalp, and a positive hair pull test. The patient has no other symptoms or family history of hair loss. The punch biopsy shows a mild lymphocytic perifollicular infiltrate and increased telogen hair with a decreased anagen-to-telogen ratio.

**Answer**: B: Loose anagen syndrome.

Loose anagen syndrome is a rare hair disorder characterized by a shortened anagen phase, leading to abnormally short hair. It is often associated with a positive hair pull test and mild lymphocytic perifollicular infiltrate on biopsy. The patient's history of progressive hair loss starting at a young age, the presence of short, sparse hair, and the positive hair pull test are all consistent with this diagnosis. The absence of other symptoms or family history of hair loss also supports this diagnosis.

**Reasoning**: The patient's history of rapidly spreading intensively pruritic papules on her extremities, with no involvement of the palms, soles, or oral mucosa, is consistent with a diagnosis of eruptive pruritic papular porokeratosis (EPP). EPP is a rare variant of porokeratosis, characterized by numerous small, itchy, annular papules that appear on the extremities. The patient's age and lack of any remarkable medical or family history also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's previous treatment with topical steroids and oral compound glycyrrhizin tablets, which had no obvious effect, suggests that the condition is unlikely to be annular lichen planus or perforating granuloma annulare.

**Answer**: C: Eruptive pruritic papular porokeratosis.

**Reasoning**: The patient presents with a strong family history of premature ASCVD, with multiple first-degree relatives having coronary artery disease, including a brother who underwent angioplasty with multiple stents at a young age. The patient's 10-year ASCVD risk is low based on traditional risk factors, but his family history and elevated Lp(a) level suggest a higher risk. The patient's coronary calcium score is also notable and supports the presence of subclinical atherosclerosis.

Given the patient's family history and elevated Lp(a) level, it is important to consider cascade screening to identify first-degree relatives with elevated Lp(a) and initiate appropriate preventive measures. Additionally, the patient's modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, such as lack of exercise and high LDL cholesterol, should be addressed.

High-intensity statin therapy and aspirin, 81 mg, daily, may be appropriate for the patient, but it is important to consider the patient's comorbidities and potential drug interactions before initiating therapy. PCSK9 inhibitor therapy may also be considered to lower the patient's Lp(a) level, but this should be discussed with a specialist and carefully weighed against potential risks and benefits.

Therefore, the best next step would be to counsel the patient on lifestyle modifications and initiate cascade screening to identify first-degree relatives with elevated Lp(a).

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of progressive imbalance, intense fear of falling, gaze-evoked horizontal nystagmus, slow saccades, and ataxic dysarthria, as well as the physical examination findings of absent stretch reflexes, mute plantar fascia, and ankle inversion with bilateral hammertoes, are consistent with a diagnosis of cerebellar ataxia. The patient's history of hypercholesterolemia and anxiety may also be relevant to the patient's overall health and potential treatment plan, but they are not directly related to the likely diagnosis of cerebellar ataxia.

The patient's age and duration of symptoms also support the diagnosis of a slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia. The presence of T2 hyperintensities in bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles, cerebellar white matter, pons, and bilateral thalamus on brain MRI is consistent with a diagnosis of cerebellar ataxia.

**Answer**: C: Niemann-Pick disease type C. Niemann-Pick disease type C is a rare genetic disorder that can cause cerebellar ataxia, among other symptoms. The patient's symptoms and examination findings, as well as the MRI results, are consistent with this diagnosis. It is important to note that a definitive diagnosis can only be made after further testing, such as genetic analysis, and a thorough clinical evaluation.

**Reasoning**: The patient has a pigmented iris lesion that has been stable in size for decades, and there are no signs of recent changes in health or ocular symptoms. The lesion is homogeneous and echogenically solid on ultrasound biomicroscopy, without angle or ciliary body involvement. These findings suggest that the lesion is likely a benign iris pigmented tumor, such as a melanocytic nevus or a pigmented iris cyst.

**Answer**: A. Observation. It is appropriate to monitor the lesion with regular follow-up appointments to ensure that it remains stable and does not show any signs of growth or malignant transformation. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (B) may be considered to confirm the diagnosis, but it is not necessary at this point, given the stable nature of the lesion and the lack of any concerning features. Plaque brachytherapy (C) and iridectomy (D) are not indicated for a benign iris lesion.

**Reasoning**: The patient's history of gastric adenocarcinoma and the presence of multiple yellowish to erythematous papules and verrucous cobblestone-like plaques on the mucosal surface of his tongue, with no associated lesions on the skin of the face, neck, arms, or other sun-exposed areas, suggest a diagnosis of nodular amyloidosis. Nodular amyloidosis is a rare condition characterized by the deposition of amyloid fibrils in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue, leading to the formation of nodules. It is often associated with chronic inflammation, such as that caused by chronic infection or malignancy. The patient's history of gastric adenocarcinoma increases the likelihood of this diagnosis.

**Reasoning**:
The patient's history of a gradually increasing rash on the left forearm, with the development of plaques and ulcers, suggests a chronic infection. The absence of pain or itching and the lack of any history of injury or exposure to suspected pathogens prior to onset suggest that the infection is not caused by a typical bacterial or viral pathogen. The patient's age and the location of the lesions also suggest that the infection is not likely to be caused by a typical bacterial or viral pathogen.

The histopathological findings of hyperkeratosis, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, and lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with neutrophils, plasma cells, and a small amount of multinucleated giant cells in the dermis, are consistent with a diagnosis of cutaneous protothecosis. The periodic acid-Schiff staining and transmission electron microscopy results support this diagnosis.

Cutaneous protothecosis is a rare infection caused by the protozoan Prototheca wickerhamii. It typically affects the skin and subcutaneous tissues and can cause ulcerative lesions. The infection is usually seen in immunocompromised individuals, but it can also occur in healthy individuals.

Sure, I'll do my best to help you with that! Here's my reasoning and answer:

**Reasoning**:
The patient presents with intermittent chest pain, which could be indicative of coronary artery disease. The patient's history of smoking and high LDL cholesterol levels further increase the likelihood of coronary artery disease. The initial electrocardiogram (ECG) shows biphasic T waves in leads V2 and V3, which could be a sign of ischemia.

**Answer**: B: Order a dobutamine stress echocardiogram.

A dobutamine stress echocardiogram would help to further evaluate the patient's cardiac function and identify any potential ischemic areas. It would also help to determine the patient's exercise capacity and any potential limitations in his physical activity. Additionally, it would provide valuable information on the patient's left ventricular function and help to guide further management decisions.

**Reasoning**: The patient has treatment-refractory nodular scleritis, which is a severe and vision-threatening condition. The patient has already been taking oral prednisone and topical prednisolone acetate without relief, and intraocular pressure remains elevated bilaterally. The patient has a history of Rosai-Dorfman-Destombes (RDD) disease, which suggests an immune-mediated etiology for the scleritis. Given the severity of the disease and the lack of response to corticosteroids, an immunomodulatory agent may be effective in controlling the inflammation.

**Reasoning**: The patient has a large, recurrent cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the right temple and brow, with orbital extension and invasion of the sphenoid wing, lacrimal gland, and lateral rectus muscle. The patient is against an orbital exenteration, and there are several treatment options available that can address the orbital component of the disease while preserving the globe.

Partial debulking of the temple mass followed by cetuximab treatment could be considered, as it may help reduce the size of the mass and improve the patient's symptoms. However, this approach may not effectively address the orbital component of the disease, and the patient may still require additional treatment to manage the intraorbital extension.

Neoadjuvant cemiplimab immunotherapy (antiâPD-L1 antibody) could also be considered, as it has been shown to be effective in treating various types of cancer, including SCC. This approach may help shrink the tumor before surgery and reduce the risk of recurrence. However, it may not be effective in all patients, and the patient's age and medical history may be factors to consider when deciding whether to use this approach.

Globe-sparing orbitotomy and surgical excision of the mass could also be considered. This approach would allow for removal of the tumor while preserving the globe and avoiding the need for an orbital exenteration. However, this approach may not be feasible given the size and location of the tumor, and the patient's medical history and overall health may also be factors to consider.

Palliative radiotherapy could be considered to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life, but it may not be effective in treating the underlying disease. Platinum-based chemotherapy could also be considered, but it may have significant side effects and may not be effective in treating SCC.

**Answer**: B: Neoadjuvant cemiplimab immunotherapy (antiâPD-L1 antibody), globe sparing orbitotomy, and surgical excision of the mass.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of subacute epigastric pain, nausea, anorexia, and water brash, along with the findings on computed tomography and esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), suggest a gastrointestinal etiology. The patient's history of chronic hepatitis B infection and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) increases the likelihood of a diagnosis related to these conditions. The absence of viral cytopathic effects and negative immunostaining results for Helicobacter pylori, cytomegalovirus, and adenovirus suggest that the gastric mucosal changes are not caused by a viral infection. The patient's recent treatment with nivolumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, raises the possibility of immunotherapy-related gastritis. However, the patient's history of chronic liver disease and HCC, as well as the presence of mesenteric nodes and diffuse thickening of the gastric body wall on computed tomography, suggest that the patient's symptoms may be related to portal hypertensive gastropathy.

The neck and chest radiography findings of narrowing and tortuosity of the trachea with displacement to the right proximal to the thoracic inlet, as well as the diffuse patchy heterogeneous airspace opacities, suggest a possible mass or lesion in the neck. The subsequent neck ultrasonography and computed tomography scan findings of a low-density lesion abutting the trachea and hypopharynx at the level of thoracic inlet, with rightward displacement of the trachea and larynx, support this diagnosis. The operative findings of extrinsic compression of the trachea, right mainstem bronchus, and esophagus with rightward deviation of the trachea and esophagus, and the absence of a mucosal tract, further support this diagnosis.

Sure, I'll do my best to provide a well-structured answer. Here's my reasoning and answer:

**Reasoning**:
The patient's history of a full-term birth by cesarean delivery and healthy, nonconsanguineous parents suggests that the likelihood of a genetic disorder is low. The patient's age and lack of symptoms also suggest that the lesion is unlikely to be caused by a degenerative condition. The presence of calcification within the lesion and the absence of signs of internal vascularization or vitritis suggest that the lesion is unlikely to be a tumor.

**Answer**: C: Request genetic testing and monitor.

I chose this answer because, based on the patient's history and clinical findings, it seems unlikely that the lesion is caused by a tumor or degenerative condition. Genetic testing may help identify a potential genetic disorder that could be causing the lesion. Monitoring the patient's condition over time can help assess whether the lesion is stable or changing, which could inform further management decisions.

Sure, I'll do my best to provide a well-structured answer. Here's my reasoning and answer:

**Reasoning**:
The patient's symptoms and examination results suggest a possible retinal degeneration or dystrophy. The abnormal foveal contour, loss of the foveal pit, and intraretinal cystoid cavities observed on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) support this diagnosis. Additionally, the symmetric bilateral mottling of the retinal pigment epithelium and hypofluorescence on fluorescein angiography suggest a systemic or genetic disorder.

**Answer**: B: Genetic testing to assess for ocular diseases.

I choose this answer because genetic testing can help identify specific genetic disorders that may be causing the patient's symptoms and signs, such as retinitis pigmentosa, Stargardt disease, or other inherited retinal diseases. This information can guide further management and counseling for the patient and his family.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms, including a tender, draining lesion on the central face that rapidly expanded into a vegetative, freely draining plaque covering the cheeks and glabella, are consistent with a diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum. The patient's history of immunoglobulin A monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance and recent travel to Kenya increase the likelihood of this diagnosis. Additionally, the negative results of tissue culture and QuantiFERON-TB Gold test support this diagnosis.

**Answer**: A. Pyoderma gangrenosum.

**Reasoning**: The patient presents with a regular supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with a rate of 178 beats per minute and a 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) ratio, consistent with a re-entry tachycardia. The electrocardiogram (ECG) shows a variable QRS complex with a complete right bundle branch block (RBBB) and a normal QRS complex, indicating a trigeminal variation in intraventricular conduction. The patient has a history of mitral valve repair, which increases the likelihood of a cardiac arrhythmia.

Given these findings, the appropriate next step would be to place a temporary pacemaker to control the ventricular rate and prevent ventricular fibrillation or cardiac arrest. This will allow the patient to be stabilized and prepared for further diagnostic testing and definitive therapy.

Low-molecular-weight heparin and amiodarone can be considered as additional therapies to prevent further arrhythmic episodes, but they are not the most urgent interventions needed in this situation. Urgent DC shock is not indicated as the patient has a regular SVT and is hemodynamically stable. An urgent electrophysiologic investigation may be considered after the patient has been stabilized and is in a stable condition.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Answer**: B, Place a temporary pacemaker and start treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin and amiodarone.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of bilateral limited mobility of joints, including the "prayer sign" and "groove sign," along with the presence of eosinophilia, elevated ESR, and CRP, suggest a diagnosis of eosinophilic fasciitis. This is supported by the normal results of nerve conduction studies and EMG, which rule out other potential causes of joint limitation such as neuropathy or myopathy. The patient's age and lack of other medical or family history also support this diagnosis.

**Answer**: D: Eosinophilic fasciitis.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of recurrent skin, nail, and oral mucosal abnormalities are consistent with candidiasis. The patient's history of recurrent infections, despite intermittent treatment with itraconazole, suggests that the infection may be caused by a resistant strain of Candida. The patient's oral thrush and angular cheilitis are also consistent with candidiasis. The patient's thickened, yellowed toenails and scaly erythematous plaques on her lower legs and feet are consistent with a fungal infection. The positive potassium hydroxide wet mount preparation and fungal culture of the skin scrapings that grew Candida albicans confirm the diagnosis of candidiasis.

**Answer**: C: Restart daily oral itraconazole. The patient's history of recurrent infections despite intermittent treatment with itraconazole suggests that the infection may be caused by a resistant strain of Candida. Therefore, the best course of action would be to restart daily oral itraconazole to treat the candidiasis.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of blurry vision, eye dryness, and lagophthalmos, along with the physical examination findings of upper eyelid retraction and lag on downgaze, suggest a possible diagnosis of an eyelid disorder. The patient's history of a functional pituitary adenoma, breast cancer, and tamoxifen therapy may also be relevant to the patient's overall health and potential treatment plan, but they do not directly explain the eyelid symptoms.

**Answer**: A: Serum thyroid laboratory testing.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a possible thyroid-related eyelid disorder, such as Graves' ophthalmopathy or thyroid-associated orbitopathy. Serum thyroid laboratory testing would help to determine if there is any thyroid dysfunction that may be contributing to the patient's eyelid symptoms. Additionally, measuring the thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels can help to diagnose Graves' disease. If the test results indicate thyroid dysfunction, further evaluation with imaging studies or consultation with an endocrinologist may be necessary.

**Reasoning**: The patient's history of cutaneous melanoma increases the likelihood of a pigmented lesion in the eye being a melanoma. The absence of other symptoms such as eye pain, redness, or vision changes suggests that the lesion is likely small and not causing significant distress to the eye. The presence of a well-demarcated pigmented brown lesion without extension into the angle on gonioscopy suggests that the lesion is likely a benign melanocytic nevus. However, to confirm the diagnosis and rule out a melanoma, further testing is necessary.

**Answer**: C: Observation with close follow-up. The patient should be monitored closely with regular eye exams to check for any changes in the size or shape of the lesion. If there is any suspicion of melanoma, a biopsy or surgical excision may be necessary.

**Reasoning**: The patient has a persistent vascular lesion in the left orbit and face, which has been diagnosed as a capillary hemangioma. The patient has already undergone embolization and debulking procedures, which have not been effective in resolving the lesion. The patient is also experiencing amblyopia, esotropia, and hypertropia. Given the persistent nature of the lesion and the risk of amblyopia, it is important to consider further treatment options.

**Answer**: B: Interventional radiology embolization and debulking. This option is chosen because the patient has already undergone embolization and debulking procedures, and further treatment is needed to address the persistent lesion. Interventional radiology embolization and debulking can be effective in reducing the size of the lesion and improving vision in patients with infantile hemangioma.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with saddle-nose deformity, which is a known complication of hypopigmented cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), specifically mycosis fungoides. The patient's history of diffuse skin plaques with erythema and diagnosis of hypopigmented CTCL support this diagnosis. Additionally, the presence of pink bacilli on Fite acid-fast stain and poorly formed granulomas on hematoxylin-eosin stain of the cutaneous lesion are consistent with CTCL.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of persistent postnasal drip, pharyngitis, odynophagia, cervicalgia, cervical lymphadenopathy, and right-sided otalgia, along with the physical examination findings of a small right tonsillolith, mild tonsillar erythema, and a mobile 2-cm, right level 2 lymph node, suggest a possible diagnosis of a laryngeal mass. The patient's history of travel to Pakistan, Turkey, Jordan, Israel, Qatar, and Dubai 5 years prior to symptom onset and recent travel to Houston, Texas, raises the possibility of exposure to certain fungal or bacterial infections. The patient's history of hookah use and breastfeeding may also be relevant. The laboratory evaluation showing an elevated eosinophil count and positive Epstein-Barr immunoglobulin G suggests a possible diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis. However, the patient's symptoms persisted despite treatment with antibiotics and steroids, which suggests that the diagnosis may be something other than a straightforward infection. The flexible transnasal videolaryngoscopy findings of a lesion on the laryngeal surface of the right epiglottis passing midline and extending to the right aryepiglottic fold, but not involving the true vocal cords, is concerning for a possible malignancy. The inconclusive office biopsy results and the need for direct laryngoscopy with biopsy support this possibility.
