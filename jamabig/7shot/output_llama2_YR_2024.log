The presence of bulblike telangiectasis on fluorescein angiography and the associated macular edema also support this diagnosis. Therefore, the next step would be to order a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to look for associated central nervous system tumors, which is the most appropriate answer (B). Initiating anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment (A) may be considered later if the patient's condition warrants it, but it is not the most appropriate next step. Performing a hypercoagulable workup (C) or ordering an echocardiogram and carotid ultrasonography (D) may also be necessary, but they are not the most urgent steps in this case.

Bone marrow biopsy (option A) may not be necessary at this point and would not provide information about the genetic cause of the patient's condition. Random skin biopsies (option C) are not typically performed for this type of evaluation. Ordering 24-hour urine testing for monoclonal proteins (option D) may be appropriate later in the patient's management, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this time.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and signs of bilateral blurry vision, eye redness, discharge, photophobia, and pain, along with the presence of hypopyon, suggest a possible infectious etiology. The patient's history of acute myeloid leukemia and recent chemotherapy increase the likelihood of a bacterial or fungal infection. The presence of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) and recent removal of the device also raise concern for a central line-associated bloodstream infection. Obtaining a sample of the hypopyon through anterior chamber paracentesis and injecting intravitreal antibiotics would be appropriate to establish a diagnosis and initiate treatment. Waiting for systemic laboratory test results and blood culture may delay appropriate treatment and potentially lead to poor visual outcomes. Performing pars plana vitrectomy may be necessary if the infection is severe and causing significant vitreous hemorrhage or tractional retinal detachment, but it is not the most appropriate initial step. Observing the patient without intervention, as expected inflammation after voretigene neparvovec gene therapy, is not supported by the patient's symptoms and signs.

The patient's symptoms of dyspareunia and recurrent, purulent discharge from his penis, as well as the physical examination findings of an erythematous, pinpoint orifice on his glans penis, are consistent with a median raphe cyst. The ultrasonography findings of a hypoechoic focal zone on the right side of the glans, with multiple hyperechoic bilaminar structures, also support this diagnosis. The biopsy result would likely show cystic dilatation of the median raphe.

Option A, pilonidal sinus, is a possible diagnosis, but it is less likely given the patient's age and the absence of other typical findings such as a pit or depression in the skin.

Option B, cutaneous larva migrans, is an unlikely diagnosis as it is a parasitic infection that typically affects the skin and subcutaneous tissue, and the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest this diagnosis.

Option D, vellus hair cyst, is also an unlikely diagnosis as it is a type of cyst that forms around a vellus hair follicle, and the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest this diagnosis.

The patient's family history of chronic orbital swelling also suggests a possible genetic predisposition to this condition. While Graves' disease can also cause orbital swelling, it typically presents with a more sudden onset and is associated with hyperthyroidism, which is not seen in this patient. Invasive fungal sinusitis with orbital extension is unlikely given the absence of necrosis or purulence on biopsy and the lack of fungal cultures. Sarcoidosis can cause orbital inflammation, but it typically presents with a more chronic course and is associated with a characteristic histopathologic pattern, which is not seen in this patient's orbital biopsy.

Explanation: Given the patient's history of recurrent presyncope and bradycardia, the presence of RBBB and LPFB on the current ECG, and the lack of change in heart rate with activity, pacemaker implantation is the most appropriate next step. The patient's history of coronary artery bypass grafting and apixaban use also support this decision, as they may increase the risk of bradycardia and cardiac events. Ambulatory ECG monitoring (option A) may be useful in some cases, but in this patient, it is unlikely to provide additional valuable information that would change management. An exercise treadmill test (option C) may also be considered, but it is not the most appropriate next step given the patient's symptoms and ECG findings. An electrophysiology study (option D) is not necessary at this time, as the diagnosis of RBBB and LPFB is already established, and a pacemaker is the most appropriate intervention.

The patient's history of mild inspiratory stridor beginning acutely at 4 months of age, without any inciting illness or event, is also consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the presence of a low-density lesion abutting the trachea and hypopharynx on neck ultrasonography and computed tomography scan, with rightward displacement of the trachea and larynx, supports the diagnosis of foregut duplication cyst. The other options, thymic cyst, hemangioma, and lymphatic malformation, can also cause respiratory symptoms in children, but do not fit the patient's symptoms and radiologic findings as well as foregut duplication cyst.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of intermittent abdominal pain, fatigue, night sweats, decreased appetite, and weight loss, along with the laboratory results of elevated levels of IL-10, IL-6, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and the imaging findings of extensive cervical, supraclavicular, retroperitoneal, pelvic, and inguinal lymphadenopathy with inflammation and fat stranding, are consistent with a diagnosis of multicentric Castleman disease. The patient's age and medical history also support this diagnosis, as Castleman disease is more common in older adults and can occur in association with other medical conditions, such as mitral valve repair. The histopathological findings of proliferation of slit-like blood vessels, regression of the lymphoid follicle, onion-skinning of mantle zone lymphocytes, and hypervascularity are also consistent with Castleman disease. Extrapulmonary tuberculosis, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and sarcoidosis can also present with lymphadenopathy and systemic symptoms, but the patient's history, laboratory results, and imaging findings do not support these diagnoses.

The ultrasonographic findings of markedly thinner subcutaneous fat of the skin, and the absence of inflammatory cell infiltration within the dermis in the biopsy specimen, also support this diagnosis. Morphea (A) is a localized scleroderma that can cause skin thickening and atrophy, but it does not typically affect the subcutaneous fat. Lupus panniculitis (B) is a rare condition characterized by inflammation of the subcutaneous fat, but it typically presents with painful nodules or plaques, rather than progressive skin depressions. Subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn (D) is a rare condition that can cause skin depressions, but it typically affects the thighs and buttocks, and is not associated with atrophy of the subcutaneous fat.

The patient's symptoms of thickening and swelling of the hands, accompanied by burning pruritus, and the appearance of white papules and excessive wrinkling on the dorsum of the hands and wrists after water immersion, are consistent with ASA. The histopathological features shown in the figure, such as hyperkeratosis, dilated eccrine ducts in the epidermis and dermis, and hyperplasia of the eccrine sweat gland, also support this diagnosis. The patient's history of frequent hand-washing during the COVID-19 pandemic may have exacerbated the condition. Eczema (option A) is a general term for a group of skin conditions characterized by inflammation and dryness, but it does not typically present with the same symptoms and histopathological features as ASA. Hereditary papulotranslucent acrokeratoderma (option C) is a rare genetic disorder that presents with small, white, and translucent papules on the palms and soles, but it is not associated with water exposure. Progressive symmetric erythrokeratoderma (option D) is a rare condition characterized by symmetric, erythematous, and scaly plaques on the palms and soles, but it is not associated with water exposure and does not have the same histopathological features as ASA.

Explanation: The patient's development of severe mitral regurgitation (MR) and pulmonary edema, along with low-flow alarms sounding on the device console, suggests that the pVAD is not effectively supporting the patient's cardiac function. Consulting cardiovascular surgery to discuss mitral valve surgery is the most appropriate next step, as the patient's condition has deteriorated and surgical intervention may be necessary to address the MR and improve cardiac function. While option A, removing the pVAD at bedside, may be considered, it is not the most appropriate step at this time, as the patient's condition is unstable and surgical evaluation is needed to determine the best course of action. Options C and D, consulting interventional cardiology for transcatheter mitral valve repair and beginning medical therapy with vasodilators for afterload reduction, respectively, may also be considered but are not the most urgent steps needed to address the patient's current condition.

Explanation: The patient's history of slightly pruritic lesions involving her face, along with the physical examination findings of multiple skin-colored and erythematous follicular papules distributed in a segmental pattern on the right side of the forehead, as well as the dorsum and tip of the nose, are consistent with a diagnosis of follicular mucinous nevus. The presence of a small, excoriated plaque on the right malar area also supports this diagnosis. The histopathological features shown in Figure 1B and C, which reveal a proliferation of follicular epithelium and an accumulation of mucin in the dermis, are also consistent with this diagnosis. Lichen striatus, idiopathic follicular mucinosis, and trichodysplasia spinulosa are other conditions that may present with similar clinical features, but they can be differentiated based on their distinct histopathological features.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of a viral prodrome, palpitations, dizziness, and heart block suggests a possible diagnosis of a cardiac autoimmune disorder, such as viral myocarditis. The patient's age and lack of structural heart disease suggest that this is a more likely diagnosis than a degenerative conduction disorder. The presence of a focal area of FDG uptake in the region of the membranous septum on FDG-PET–CT suggests inflammation in the atrioventricular (AV) node, which is consistent with a cardiac autoimmune disorder. Corticosteroids may be effective in reducing inflammation and preserving cardiac function. Therefore, the best next step would be to place a temporary pacemaker and start corticosteroids.

It's important to note that the patient's symptoms and test results suggest a broader differential diagnosis, and further evaluation and monitoring may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and guide management.

The patient's recent travel and exposure to ticks increases the likelihood of a tick-borne illness. Empirical intravenous antibiotics should be started while awaiting the results of blood cultures and further diagnostic testing.

Option A, performing a skin biopsy, may be necessary later on to confirm the diagnosis, but it is not the most urgent step at this time.

Option B, administering tissue plasminogen activator, is not appropriate for this patient's presentation, as there is no evidence of an acute ischemic stroke or other indication for thrombolysis.

Option D, pursuing surgical evaluation, may be necessary if the patient's condition worsens or if there is evidence of a surgical emergency, but it is not the most appropriate step at this time.
