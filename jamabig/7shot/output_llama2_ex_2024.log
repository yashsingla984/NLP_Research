Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is D. Provide supportive care.

The patient in this scenario has developed intermittent apneic episodes, which could be indicative of a number of different causes, including respiratory depression, hypoventilation, or a foreign body obstruction. The presence of bilateral rhonchi and a responsiveness to verbal commands only with deep painful stimulus suggests that the patient's respiratory status is compromised.

Administering activated charcoal (A) may be appropriate in cases of poisoning or drug overdose, but it is not the most appropriate choice in this scenario. There is no evidence to suggest that the patient has ingested a toxic substance or has a drug overdose.

Arranging endoscopy (B) may be necessary to evaluate the patient's upper gastrointestinal tract, but it is not the most urgent step in managing the patient's current symptoms. The patient's apneic episodes and altered mental status suggest that there may be a more immediate threat to their respiratory status, and endoscopy may not be able to address this issue quickly enough.

Performing gastric lavage (C) may be appropriate in cases of poisoning or foreign body ingestion, but it is not the most appropriate choice in this scenario. There is no evidence to suggest that the patient has ingested a toxic substance or has a foreign body in their stomach.

Providing supportive care (D) is the most appropriate choice in this scenario. The patient's apneic episodes and altered mental status suggest that they are experiencing respiratory distress and may require immediate intervention to maintain their airway and oxygenation. Providing supportive care, such as oxygen therapy and close monitoring of the patient's vital signs, is the most urgent step in managing their symptoms and ensuring their safety.

In summary, while all of the answer choices have the potential to be relevant in certain clinical scenarios, the most appropriate choice in this particular scenario is D. Provide supportive care.

**Answer**: C. Emphysematous thyroiditis

The patient's symptoms of high-grade fever, neck pain, and a foreign body sensation in the throat, along with the findings on CT scan, are consistent with emphysematous thyroiditis. This is a rare condition that occurs when gas forms in the thyroid gland, usually as a result of an infection. The gas can cause pain and swelling in the neck, and can also lead to fever and difficulty swallowing.

The patient's history of eating chicken 3 days prior to presentation suggests a possible source of the infection. The CT scan findings of gas in the thyroid gland (Figure, C) and the presence of a radio-opaque foreign body at the level of the cricopharyngeus muscle (Figure, A and B) support the diagnosis of emphysematous thyroiditis.

The other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and CT scan findings.

A. Parapharyngeal abscess: This is a collection of pus in the space between the pharynx and the neck muscles. While this can cause neck pain and fever, it is unlikely to cause a foreign body sensation in the throat or the CT scan findings of gas in the thyroid gland.

B. Retropharyngeal abscess: This is a collection of pus in the space behind the pharynx. Like parapharyngeal abscess, it can cause neck pain and fever, but it is unlikely to cause a foreign body sensation in the throat or the CT scan findings of gas in the thyroid gland.

D. Mediastinitis: This is an infection of the tissues in the mediastinum, the area between the lungs and the breastbone. While this can cause fever and chest pain, it is unlikely to cause a foreign body sensation in the throat or the CT scan findings of gas in the thyroid gland.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is emphysematous thyroiditis.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain why D. Mpox is the correct answer and why the other choices are incorrect.

**Answer**: D. Mpox

The patient's symptoms of acute-onset painful scattered umbilicated papulopustules and ovoid ulcerated plaques with elevated, pink borders on the face, trunk, and extremities are consistent with Mpox, a rare viral disease caused by the monkeypox virus. The patient's history of AIDS and significant immunocompromise also increases the likelihood of this diagnosis.

The Tzanck smear performed on the patient showed ballooning of keratinocytes and peripheralization of nuclear material, which is consistent with the cytological changes seen in Mpox infection.

The other choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and cytological findings:

A. Herpes simplex virus (HSV): While HSV can cause papulopustules and ulcerated lesions, the patient's acute-onset and widespread distribution of lesions, as well as the absence of fever and other systemic symptoms, are less typical of HSV infection. Additionally, the Tzanck smear findings are not consistent with HSV.

B. Histoplasmosis: Histoplasmosis is a fungal infection that can cause skin lesions, but the patient's symptoms and cytological findings are not consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's history of AIDS and significant immunocompromise also reduces the likelihood of histoplasmosis.

C. Molluscum contagiosum: Molluscum contagiosum is a viral infection that can cause umbilicated papules, but the patient's widespread distribution of lesions and cytological findings are not consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of AIDS and significant immunocompromise increases the likelihood of a more severe and atypical presentation of Molluscum contagiosum.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, cytological findings, and medical history, the most likely diagnosis is Mpo

**Answer**:C. Repeat complete blood cell count with differential in 1 to 2 weeks

The correct answer is C. Repeat complete blood cell count with differential in 1 to 2 weeks.

The patient's symptoms of fatigue and dyspnea, along with the laboratory results showing anemia, leukocytosis, and thrombocytopenia, suggest that the patient may have developed peripheral blasts, which are immature white blood cells that can accumulate in the peripheral blood. The flow cytometry results support this diagnosis by showing a small population of CD34+/CD117+ cells, which are markers of immature myeloblasts.

Repeating the complete blood cell count with differential in 1 to 2 weeks is the most appropriate next step because it will allow the clinician to monitor the patient's peripheral blast count and assess whether the blasts are increasing or decreasing over time. This information will help guide further management decisions, such as whether to initiate cytoreductive therapy or consider a bone marrow transplant.

Option A, Perform a bone marrow biopsy, may be considered later on in the patient's management, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this time. While a bone marrow biopsy can provide valuable information about the patient's bone marrow morphology and help confirm the diagnosis of peripheral blasts, it is an invasive procedure that carries risks and may not be necessary at this early stage of management.

Option B, Prescribe all-trans retinoic acid, is not appropriate for this patient. All-trans retinoic acid is a chemotherapeutic agent that is used to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia, a type of leukemia that is characterized by the presence of promyelocytes in the peripheral blood and bone marrow. While the patient's flow cytometry results show a small population of immature myeloblasts, the patient does not have acute promyelocytic leukemia, and all-trans retinoic acid would not be an appropriate treatment for this patient's condition.

Option D, Start cytoreductive therapy with hydroxyure

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

**Answer**: C. Perineural spread of cutaneous malignancy

The patient's symptoms of progressive right-sided facial numbness and weakness, vision changes, and headaches, along with the physical examination findings of right-sided ptosis, severe right facial weakness in a lower motor neuron pattern, and temporal wasting, suggest a diagnosis of a neurological disorder affecting the right side of the face and head.

The patient's history of a left cheek melanoma completely excised years prior, numerous cutaneous squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the bilateral head and neck removed without issue, and type 2 diabetes, suggests that the patient has a history of skin cancer and may be at risk for perineural spread of cutaneous malignancy.

Perineural spread of cutaneous malignancy occurs when cancer cells infiltrate the nerves and travel along the nerve fibers, leading to symptoms such as facial weakness or numbness, vision changes, and headaches. This condition is often associated with a poor prognosis, and early diagnosis and treatment are critical.

The patient's negative MRI results and nondiagnostic biopsy of CN VII do not rule out the possibility of perineural spread of cutaneous malignancy, as MRI may not always detect early stages of perineural spread, and biopsy results may be inconclusive. The mildly elevated protein values in the CSF studies suggest inflammation or infection, which could be related to the perineural spread of cancer cells.

The patient's history of smoking and hyperlipidemia may also increase the risk of perineural spread of cutaneous malignancy.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and medical history, the most likely diagnosis is perineural spread of cutaneous malignancy.

In contrast, the other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and findings:

**Answer**:D. Myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene fusions

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a hematological malignancy, specifically a myeloid/lymphoid neoplasm with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene fusions. The patient's high white blood cell count, marked leukocytosis, and eosinophilia are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's history of night sweats and itching also support this diagnosis, as these are common symptoms in patients with hematological malignancies.

The patient's bone marrow biopsy showed hypercellular marrow with myeloid hyperplasia, increased eosinophils with some dysplasia, and a blast count of 2%, which is consistent with a myeloid/lymphoid neoplasm. The positron emission tomographic–computed tomographic scan showed a left upper cervical lymph node of 2.6 cm and a left inguinal lymph node of 3.1 × 2.3 cm with an standardized uptake value max of 5.7, which suggests the presence of an active lymphoid lesion.

The patient's lymph node biopsy immunohistochemical stain with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) was positive, which is consistent with a diagnosis of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (T-ALL). The presence of a TDT-positive population of cells in the lymph node biopsy sample supports this diagnosis.

The patient's FIP1L1::PDGFRA rearrangement, as shown by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), is consistent with a diagnosis of myeloid/lymphoid neoplasm with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene fusions. This genetic abnormality is commonly found in patients with T-ALL.

In summary, the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, bone marrow biopsy

**Answer**:B. Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease

The correct answer is B. Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease, as it matches the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

A. Lymphoma is an incorrect choice because the patient's lymphadenopathy did not show any evidence of malignancy on fine-needle aspiration biopsy, and the patient did not have any signs of systemic lymphoma.

C. Systemic lupus erythematosus is an incorrect choice because the patient did not have any clinical or laboratory evidence of autoimmune disease, such as malar rash, arthritis, or positive autoantibodies.

D. Rosai-Dorfman disease is an incorrect choice because it is a rare condition characterized by massive lymphadenopathy and histiocytic infiltration, but it typically affects the lymph nodes in the neck and mediastinum, and the patient did not have any evidence of mass lesions in these areas.

In contrast, Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease is a rare condition characterized by fever, lymphadenopathy, and skin eruption, which matches the patient's symptoms. The laboratory results, including negative infectious disease and rheumatological workup, and the pathological findings of coagulative necrosis, apoptosis, and karyorrhectic debris on excisional biopsy, also support this diagnosis.

**Answer**: A. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging

The correct answer is A, Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, because it is the most appropriate test to evaluate the patient's ventricular tachycardia and assess the structural and functional status of her heart. The patient's history of breast cancer and pulmonary nodules with negative biopsy findings for metastatic disease but positive for granulomatous inflammation suggests that there may be an underlying cardiac condition that needs to be evaluated.

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive test that provides detailed information about the heart's structure and function, including the ventricles, atria, valves, and coronary arteries. It can help identify potential causes of ventricular tachycardia, such as cardiac scar tissue, inflammation, or fibrosis. Additionally, cardiac MRI can assess the patient's left ventricular and right ventricular systolic function, which can help guide management decisions for her heart failure.

In contrast, the other answer choices are not as appropriate for the patient's current condition:

B. Electrophysiology study: This test is used to evaluate the electrical activity of the heart and identify the origin of arrhythmias. While it may be useful in some cases of ventricular tachycardia, it is not the most appropriate test in this patient's case, as the arrhythmia has already been terminated and the focus is on evaluating the structural and functional status of the heart.

C. Genetic testing: This test is used to identify genetic mutations that may be associated with cardiac conditions. While it may be appropriate in some cases, it is not the most relevant test for this patient's current condition, as the focus is on evaluating the heart's structure and function rather than identifying genetic mutations.

D. Implantation of cardiac defibrillator: This is a treatment option for patients with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias. While it may be considered in some cases, it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient, as the focus is on evaluating and managing the underlying cause of

**Answer**:C. Diffuse-type neurofibroma

The patient's symptoms, such as headaches and visual-spatial difficulties when driving at night, and the slow-growing nature of the lesion, are consistent with a diffuse-type neurofibroma. The patient's age and the absence of any significant nuclear pleomorphism or mitotic activity also support this diagnosis.

The MRI findings, including the ill-defined, diffuse, intensely enhancing scalp lesion with prominent vascularity and underlying calvarial thickening, are also consistent with a diffuse-type neurofibroma. The fact that the lesion does not demonstrate any osseous destruction or intracranial extension further supports this diagnosis.

The positive staining for S100 and SOX10 immunostains also supports the diagnosis of a diffuse-type neurofibroma, as these markers are commonly expressed in neurofibromas.

The other options are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and MRI findings.

A. Arteriovenous malformation of the scalp: While the patient's symptoms of headaches and visual-spatial difficulties could be consistent with an arteriovenous malformation (AVM), the MRI findings do not support this diagnosis. AVMs typically demonstrate a more distinct, well-circumscribed lesion with abnormal blood vessels, and they are often associated with seizures, which the patient does not report.

B. Solitary fibrous tumor: Solitary fibrous tumors are typically slow-growing, benign tumors that can occur in various parts of the body, including the scalp. However, they are usually well-circumscribed and do not demonstrate the diffuse, intensely enhancing nature of the lesion described in this case. Additionally, solitary fibrous tumors typically stain positive for CD34, which is not mentioned in the case.

D. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans: Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is a type of skin cancer that can occur in the scalp. However, it typically presents with a more distinct,

The correct answer is D. Phaeohyphomycosis.

Phaeohyphomycosis is a type of fungal infection caused by dematiaceous fungi, which are characterized by the presence of melanin in their cell walls. The infection typically affects the skin and subcutaneous tissues, and can cause a variety of symptoms, including skin lesions, discoloration, and scarring.

In this case, the patient presented with multiple well-defined brown erythematous scaly plaques with central scarring on the face and proximal extremities, as well as saddle nose deformity, perforation of the hard palate, and necrotic plaques on the ear, causing destruction of ear cartilage. These symptoms are consistent with the cutaneous manifestations of phaeohyphomycosis.

The patient also had a history of wheezing and breathlessness, which could be related to the palatal perforation and stridor, indicating involvement of the upper respiratory tract.

The negative serologic analysis results for HIV-1/2, antinuclear antibody, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies suggest that this is not an autoimmune disorder.

The punch skin biopsy showed an infiltrate of foamy histiocytes and pigmented yeasts without multiaxial septation, which is consistent with the histopathologic features of phaeohyphomycosis.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, medical history, and histopathologic findings, the most likely diagnosis is phaeohyphomycosis.

The other answer choices are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and medical history:

A. Chromoblastomycosis is a type of fungal infection that typically affects the skin and subcutaneous tissues, causing verrucous or nodular lesions. It is caused by the fungus Fonsecaea pedrosoi, which is endemic in certain regions of the world, including South America and the Caribbean.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain why B. Meningioma is the correct answer and why the other choices are incorrect.

**Answer**: B. Meningioma

The patient's symptoms of seizures, along with the imaging findings of diffuse enhancement and possible coalescence in the left mastoid process with adjacent dural enhancement and sigmoid sinus occlusion, suggest a diagnosis of meningioma. Meningioma is a type of tumor that arises from the meninges, the protective coverings of the brain and spinal cord. It is the most common type of primary brain tumor and can cause a variety of symptoms, including seizures, headaches, and cognitive changes.

The patient's history of recent antibiotic use and the absence of periauricular swelling or erythema also support the diagnosis of meningioma, as this condition can present with few or no symptoms in its early stages. Additionally, the presence of coalescence of mastoid air cells with erosion into the sigmoid sinus, as shown on the computed tomographic venogram, is consistent with meningioma.

The histopathological findings of cells with oval nuclei and abundant cytoplasm arranged in syncytial clusters with occasional whorls, pseudoinclusions, and psammomatous calcifications, as well as the positive immunohistochemical stains for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and vimentin, are also consistent with meningioma.

In contrast, Langerhans cell histiocytosis (choice A) is a rare disorder that affects the immune system and can cause a variety of symptoms, including seizures, but it typically affects children and young adults and is characterized by the presence of Langerhans cells, which are not seen in the patient's histopathological findings.

Acute coalescent mastoiditis with sigmoid sinus thrombosis (choice C) is a complication of mastoiditis that can cause seizures, but it is not typically associated with the imaging findings of diffuse enhancement and possible coalescence in the

**Answer**:A. Leishmaniasis

Leishmaniasis is a parasitic infection caused by the Leishmania protozoa, which is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected sandflies. The clinical presentation of leishmaniasis can vary depending on the species of Leishmania and the location of the infection.

In this case, the patient presented with a 2-week history of midline sore throat, cobbling, adherent, thick yellow mucus, and ulceration of the uvula, as well as recurrent skin lesions at the incision site and in the surrounding skin. The patient had a history of travel to Guyana 5 years prior, where he developed multiple neck subcutaneous nodules and a 4-cm focus of neck cellulitis, which were treated with excision of the largest lesion. The pathology results revealed dense granulomatous inflammation, but were negative for bacteria, fungus, and acid-fast bacillus.

Given the patient's history of travel to an endemic region, the presence of skin lesions, and the negative results for bacterial and fungal infections, leishmaniasis is a strong consideration. The patient's symptoms of sore throat and ulceration of the uvula are consistent with leishmaniasis, as the parasite can cause ulcerative lesions in the mucous membranes of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts. The recurrent skin lesions at the incision site and in the surrounding skin are also consistent with leishmaniasis, as the parasite can cause skin lesions that can recur over time.

The other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms. Tuberculosis (choice B) is a possible diagnosis given the patient's symptoms of sore throat and skin lesions, but the negative results for acid-fast bacillus and the lack of systemic symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and weight loss make it less likely. Leprosy (choice C) is an unlikely diagnosis given the patient's lack of peripheral nerve damage, skin lesions, and negative results for acid

**Answer**:C. Medication adverse effect

The correct answer is C. Medication adverse effect. The patient's history of mycosis fungoides and recent exposure to pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, a chemotherapy drug known to cause mucosal pigmentation, suggest that the oral mucosal pigmentation is likely a medication adverse effect. The patient's history of romidepsin use, which can also cause skin hyperpigmentation, supports this diagnosis.

Laugier-Hunziker syndrome (A) is a rare condition characterized by benign pigmented macules on the oral mucosa, lips, and digits. It is not associated with mycosis fungoides or medication use.

Melanoma (B) is a type of skin cancer that can metastasize to the oral mucosa, but it is not associated with mycosis fungoides or medication use. The patient's history of mycosis fungoides and recent chemotherapy use make it unlikely that the oral pigmentation is due to melanoma.

Oral involvement of mycosis fungoides (D) is a possibility, but it is less likely than medication adverse effect given the patient's recent exposure to pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride. Mycosis fungoides typically presents with skin lesions, and oral involvement is rare. The patient's history of mycosis fungoides and recent chemotherapy use support the diagnosis of medication adverse effect over oral involvement of mycosis fungoides.

**Answer**:B. Peripheral blood smear

The patient's symptoms and photograph suggest a possible diagnosis of onchocerciasis, also known as river blindness, which is a parasitic infection caused by Onchocerca volvulus. Onchocerciasis is endemic in Nigeria, where the patient immigrated from, and it is characterized by the presence of microfilariae in the skin and eyes. The patient's symptoms of a "pulling and popping" sensation in his left eye and the photograph of an irregular, serpiginous extension from beneath the plica semilunaris toward the corneal limbus with localized conjunctival hyperemia are consistent with the presence of microfilariae in the conjunctiva.

The correct answer, B. Peripheral blood smear, is the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation. A peripheral blood smear can detect the presence of microfilariae in the blood, which would support the diagnosis of onchocerciasis. This is a simple and non-invasive test that can provide valuable information in the diagnosis of this condition.

The other answer choices are not as appropriate for the following reasons:

A. Treatment with diethylcarbamazine: This is an anti-parasitic medication that is used to treat onchocerciasis, but it is not the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation. Before starting treatment, it is important to confirm the diagnosis with a peripheral blood smear or other diagnostic tests.

C. Serological testing for onchocerciasis: This is a blood test that can detect antibodies against Onchocerca volvulus, but it is not as sensitive as a peripheral blood smear for detecting microfilariae.

D. Exploration of conjunctiva and removal of foreign body: This is not an appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation, as there is no evidence of a foreign body in the conjunctiva. The patient's symptoms and photograph suggest a diagnosis of onchocerciasis, which should be confirmed with a peripheral blood smear before considering any surgical intervention.

**Answer**:C. Observe with no additional testing or intervention

The correct answer is C. Observe with no additional testing or intervention, as the case describes a pigmented iris lesion that is cystic and has no solid component, and is not causing any symptoms or abnormalities in the patient's vision. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy with cytology and cytogenetics (option A) would not be necessary as the lesion is cystic and not suspicious for malignancy. Iodine 125 plaque radiotherapy (option B) is not indicated for a benign cystic lesion and could potentially cause harm to the surrounding tissue. Cyst paracentesis with complete drainage (option D) would also not be necessary as the lesion is not causing any symptoms and is not large enough to cause significant discomfort or vision problems. Therefore, the best course of action would be to observe the lesion with no additional testing or intervention.

**Answer**: D. Euthyroid pretibial mucinosis

The correct answer is D. Euthyroid pretibial mucinosis.

A. Pretibial myxedema is a condition characterized by the accumulation of mucin in the skin, leading to thickening and hardening of the skin. While it can cause papules and nodules, it typically affects the pretibial area (in front of the tibia) and does not involve the formation of large plaques. Therefore, option A is incorrect.

B. Elephantiasis nostras verrucosa is a condition that causes thickening and hardening of the skin, often on the legs, due to the accumulation of keratin. It can cause large plaques and nodules, but it is typically associated with a history of chronic lymphedema, which is not mentioned in the patient's history. Additionally, the patient had been previously diagnosed with elephantiasis nostras verrucosa, and the current presentation does not seem to be consistent with that diagnosis. Therefore, option B is incorrect.

C. Lobomycosis is a rare fungal infection that can cause nodules and plaques on the skin. However, it typically affects the face, ears, and arms, and is not commonly associated with the lower legs. Additionally, the patient's history of morbid obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and stroke would not be consistent with lobomycosis. Therefore, option C is incorrect.

D. Euthyroid pretibial mucinosis is a condition characterized by the accumulation of mucin in the skin, leading to thickening and hardening of the skin. It typically affects the pretibial area (in front of the tibia) and can cause large plaques and nodules. The patient's history of long-standing thickening and induration of the legs, as well as the physical examination findings, are consistent with this diagnosis. Therefore, option D is correct.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is B: Familial cerebral cavernous malformations.

This patient's presentation of bluish, partially keratotic papules and nodules on the lower legs, along with a history of recurrent seizures and cerebral venous malformations in the family, suggests a diagnosis of familial cerebral cavernous malformations. The patient's father and aunt also had cerebral venous malformations, which supports the diagnosis.

The other options do not fit the patient's presentation and medical history:

A: Blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome is a rare condition characterized by multiple soft, bluish papules and nodules on the skin, often associated with other vascular malformations. While the patient's skin lesions may appear similar, the presence of cerebral venous malformations and a positive family history suggest a different diagnosis.

C: Glomuvenous malformations are benign vascular tumors that can occur in the skin or mucous membranes. They are usually not associated with neurological symptoms or a positive family history of cerebral venous malformations.

D: Verrucous venous malformations are characterized by slow-flow vascular malformations that can cause skin thickening and verrucous lesions. While the patient's skin lesions may have a similar appearance, the presence of cerebral venous malformations and a positive family history suggest a different diagnosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: Familial cerebral cavernous malformations.

**Answer**: D. Observation

Explanation:

The patient's history of macular degeneration, retinal detachment, and previous treatment with a scleral buckle suggests that the inferotemporal mass is likely a benign chorioretinal scar. The patient's symptoms of decreased vision in the left eye for 6 months, along with the physical examination findings of a pale optic disc and geographic macular atrophy, are consistent with age-related macular degeneration. The absence of any retinal breaks or detachment also supports this diagnosis.

The MRI findings of a shallow hypointense circumferential band and an inferotemporal hyperintense nodular mass, with no enhancement with gadolinium, are consistent with a benign chorioretinal scar. The lack of any extraocular tumor and the absence of any signs of systemic disease also support this diagnosis.

Given the patient's history and the imaging findings, it is likely that the inferotemporal mass is a benign chorioretinal scar related to the previous scleral buckle surgery. Therefore, the best course of action would be to observe the patient with regular follow-up appointments to monitor for any changes in the mass or the patient's vision.

In contrast, choice A, whole-body positron emission tomography scan, would not be necessary in this case, as there is no evidence of systemic disease. Choice B, fine-needle aspiration biopsy, would also not be appropriate, as the mass is likely benign and there is no indication for biopsy. Choice C, plaque radiotherapy, would also not be appropriate, as there is no evidence of malignancy.

The correct answer is C. Epidermolysis bullosa pruriginosa (EBP) because it matches the given symptoms and characteristics.

Epidermolysis bullosa pruriginosa (EBP) is a rare autoimmune skin condition that causes intensely itchy, crusted, and inflamed papules and plaques. The condition typically affects the extensor surfaces of the limbs, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms of multiple itchy erythematous to violaceous papules and plaques localized to the left shin.

The patient's history of progressive, multiple itchy erythematous to violaceous papules and plaques over more than 10 years, along with the presence of milia and erosions with partially detached epidermis, are also consistent with EBP.

Histopathologic examination revealed dermoepidermal separation and several milia, which are both characteristic features of EBP. Dermoepidermal separation refers to the separation of the epidermis from the dermis, which can cause blistering and erosions. Milia are small, benign growths that can occur in the skin and are often seen in EBP.

In contrast, the other answer choices do not match the patient's symptoms and characteristics:

A. Pretibial pruritic papular dermatitis (PPPD) is a condition that causes intensely itchy, crusted, and inflamed papules on the lower legs. While it can share some similarities with EBP, PPPD typically does not cause milia or dermoepidermal separation.

B. Hypertrophic lichen planus (HLP) is a condition that causes thickened, rough skin with a characteristic violaceous color. While it can cause itching and papules, it does not typically cause milia or dermoepidermal separation.

D. Lichen amyloidosis (LA) is a condition that causes the accumulation of amyloid deposits in the skin, leading to the formation of papules

The correct answer is D. Check blood pressure.

The patient's symptoms of painless vision loss and central scotoma in her left eye, along with the physical examination findings of bilateral sectorial macular star, optic disc edema, and hyperreflective material in the outer plexiform layer, are consistent with a diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). IIH is a condition characterized by increased pressure in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) that can cause damage to the optic nerve and result in vision loss.

Checking the patient's blood pressure is an appropriate next step in the evaluation of IIH, as it can help to identify whether the patient has a concurrent condition that may be contributing to the development of IIH, such as obesity, sleep apnea, or hypertension. Elevated blood pressure can also be a sign of a more severe form of IIH, known as fulminant IIH.

The other answer choices are not appropriate next steps in the evaluation of IIH.

A. Prescribe systemic corticosteroids: Corticosteroids may be used in the treatment of IIH, but they are not typically prescribed as a first step in the evaluation of the condition. Instead, they are typically reserved for cases where the patient has severe vision loss or where other treatments have been ineffective.

B. Order serologic testing for infectious neuroretinitis: Infectious neuroretinitis is a condition that can cause vision loss and other ocular symptoms, but it is not associated with the physical examination findings described in the case. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are more consistent with IIH.

C. Rule out brain tumor: A brain tumor can cause similar symptoms to IIH, but it is not a likely diagnosis given the patient's age and the absence of other symptoms such as headache, nausea, or vomiting. Additionally, the physical examination findings of bilateral sectorial macular star and optic disc edema are not typical of brain tumors.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Check blood pressure.

**Answer**: B. Rhabdomyoma

The correct answer is B. Rhabdomyoma, which is a type of benign soft tissue tumor that arises from immature muscle cells, also known as rhabdomyoblasts.

The patient's history of a congenital tongue mass that has been present since birth and has grown proportionally with the child's somatic growth, along with the MRI findings of a uniformly solid and well-circumscribed mass without cystic components or flow voids, hypointense on T2, and hyperintense with homogeneous contrast enhancement on T1, are all consistent with a diagnosis of rhabdomyoma.

Rhabdomyoma is a rare type of tumor, but it is the most common type of soft tissue tumor in the head and neck region. It typically affects children and young adults, and the tongue is a common site of occurrence.

The other answer choices are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and MRI findings.

A. Hemangioma is a benign tumor of blood vessels, which can cause a mass effect, but it typically does not have the same MRI characteristics as rhabdomyoma. Hemangiomas are usually isointense or slightly hyperintense on T1 and hyperintense on T2, and they often have a characteristic "spoke-wheel" or "target" appearance.

C. Rhabdomyosarcoma is a malignant tumor of immature muscle cells, which can also cause a mass effect. However, rhabdomyosarcoma typically has a more aggressive growth pattern than rhabdomyoma, and it can infiltrate surrounding tissues. The MRI findings of a rhabdomyosarcoma can vary, but they often show a heterogeneous signal intensity with areas of necrosis or hemorrhage.

D. Teratoma is a benign tumor that contains a mixture of different tissue types, such as skin, muscle, and bone. Teratomas can occur in the head and neck region, but they are not typically well-circumscribed and homogeneous like the mass described in the patient's history.

The correct answer is C. Start topical steroids and perform a skin patch test.

The patient's symptoms of erythema, edema, pain, pruritus, and serous fluid drainage at the mastectomy incision sites, as well as the development of an erythematous papulovesicular rash on her trunk and upper and lower extremities, suggest a possible allergic or hypersensitivity reaction. The fact that the patient had a similar episode of rash and delayed wound healing after laparoscopy 1 year prior to presentation further supports this possibility.

Topical steroids can help to reduce inflammation and itching associated with allergic reactions. Performing a skin patch test can help to identify the specific allergen that is causing the reaction, which can guide further management.

Option A, performing a skin biopsy at the mastectomy incision site, may be necessary to rule out other potential causes of the rash, such as an infection or cancer recurrence. However, it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as the patient's symptoms and history suggest an allergic reaction rather than a skin infection or cancer recurrence.

Option B, prescribing acyclovir (400 mg orally 3 times daily for 7 days), may be effective in treating a viral infection, but it is not appropriate in this case, as there is no evidence to suggest a viral etiology for the rash.

Option D, treating with doxycycline (100 mg orally twice daily for 7 days), may be effective in treating a bacterial infection, but it is not appropriate in this case, as there is no evidence to suggest a bacterial etiology for the rash.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to start topical steroids and perform a skin patch test to help identify and manage the possible allergic reaction.

**Answer**: A. Disseminated fusariosis

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a severe systemic infection, with a high likelihood of fungal etiology. The presence of painful necrotic skin lesions, mucositis, acute kidney injury, and neutropenic fever are all consistent with a disseminated fungal infection. The patient's history of multiple myeloma and recent myeloablative conditioning further increase the likelihood of fungal infection.

The biopsy specimen from a skin nodule on the left lateral thigh showed septated hyphae and oval microconidia on lactophenol cotton blue staining, which is consistent with Fusarium infection. Fusarium is a genus of filamentous fungi that can cause opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients, particularly those with hematologic malignancies. Disseminated fusariosis is a rare but life-threatening infection that can occur in these patients, and it is characterized by the presence of Fusarium organisms in multiple organs and tissues.

In contrast, invasive aspergillosis (choice B) is another opportunistic fungal infection that can affect immunocompromised patients, but it typically presents with pulmonary symptoms and radiographic findings, such as nodules or cavities, which are not seen in this patient. Pseudomonal ecthyma gangrenosum (choice C) is a rare condition that occurs in patients with neutropenia and is characterized by the formation of necrotic skin lesions, but it is typically associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, not Fusarium. Sweet syndrome (choice D) is a rare condition characterized by the rapid development of fever, neutrophilia, and skin lesions, but it is not associated with fungal infections.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and biopsy findings, the most likely diagnosis is disseminated fusariosis.

**Answer**: D. Carcinoma hemorrhagiectoides

The correct answer is D. Carcinoma hemorrhagiectoides because it is a rare vascular tumor that can present with a violaceous plaque with blackish papules and nodules, similar to the patient's symptoms. Carcinoma hemorrhagiectoides typically affects the skin and subcutaneous tissue, and it can arise in association with pre-existing radiation therapy, as in this case. The patient's history of primary salivary duct carcinoma of the hard palate and recent radiotherapy treatment increases the likelihood of this diagnosis.

A. Radiotherapy-induced epithelioid angiosarcoma is an incorrect choice because, although it can occur after radiation therapy, it typically presents as a rapidly growing mass, unlike the patient's slowly progressive plaque.

B. Kaposi sarcoma is an incorrect choice because it typically presents as a painless, bluish-red or purple, flat or raised lesion, and is more common in the lower extremities. It is also associated with HIV infection, which is not mentioned in the patient's history.

C. Acquired angiokeratomas are benign vascular lesions that can appear as red or purple papules or nodules, but they are not typically associated with radiation therapy or malignancy.

Therefore, D. Carcinoma hemorrhagiectoides is the most appropriate diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and medical history.

**Answer**: C. Bullous pilomatricoma

The correct answer is C. Bullous pilomatricoma because it matches the symptoms and characteristics described in the case.

Bullous pilomatricoma is a rare benign tumor that originates from the hair matrix cells. It typically presents as a slow-growing, painless mass on the skin, often on the head, neck, or extremities. The tumor is composed of multiple locules filled with a chalky-white material, which is made up of keratin and lipids.

In this case, the patient presented with a red, 6 cm x 6 cm tumor on her right upper arm, which had been gradually enlarging over 6 months. The tumor was protuberant, thick-walled, and well-defined, with a firm-to-hard nodule inside. The appearance of the tumor and the presence of a hard nodule are consistent with a pilomatricoma.

The histological examination revealed basophilic cells and shadow cells, which are characteristic features of pilomatricoma. Additionally, the presence of dilated lymphatic vessels is also consistent with this diagnosis.

The other answer choices do not match the symptoms and characteristics described in the case:

A. Matrical carcinoma is a malignant tumor that arises from the hair follicle. It is typically found on the scalp and presents as a painless, firm nodule. It does not match the description of the patient's tumor.

B. Panfolliculoma is a benign tumor that arises from the hair follicle. It typically presents as a small, painless nodule on the skin, often on the face or neck. It does not match the size and location of the patient's tumor.

D. Trichodiscoma is a rare benign tumor that arises from the hair follicle. It typically presents as a small, painless nodule on the skin, often on the scalp. It does not match the size and location of the patient's tumor.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Bullous pilomatricoma.

**Answer**:B. Order brain magnetic resonance imaging to look for associated central nervous system tumors

The correct answer is B because the patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a neurocutaneous syndrome that affects the brain and retina. TSC is characterized by the growth of non-cancerous tumors in the brain, which can cause a variety of symptoms, including seizures, developmental delays, and vision problems. The patient's history of a long-standing growth on her cheek and her lightly pigmented patches of skin and subungual fibromas on her toes are also consistent with TSC.

The patient's retinal lesion, described as an area of superior macular whitening with associated intraretinal hemorrhages and exudates, is consistent with a type 1 astrocytic hamartoma of the retina, which is a common feature of TSC. The fluorescein angiography findings of abnormally dilated and tortuous retinal vessels, irregular capillary branching patterns, and bulblike telangiectasis with late leakage in the superior macula are also consistent with TSC.

Therefore, it is important to order a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to look for associated central nervous system tumors, as TSC can affect the brain and cause a variety of symptoms. This will help to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.

In contrast, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment (choice A) may be used to treat some eye conditions, such as age-related macular degeneration, but it is not typically used to treat TSC. Performing a hypercoagulable workup (choice C) may be appropriate for some patients with TSC who have a history of seizures or stroke, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. Ordering an echocardiogram and carotid ultrasonography (choice D) may be appropriate for some patients with TSC who have a history of cardiovascular disease, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case.

The correct answer is B: Check an antisynthetase antibody panel.

The patient's symptoms of dysphagia, weight loss, and bibasilar crackles on lung auscultation, along with the maculopapular rash and negative results for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C, suggest a possible diagnosis of systemic sclerosis (SSc), an autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organs, including the lungs and esophagus. The patient's history of Raynaud disease, a condition that affects blood flow to the fingers and toes, also supports this diagnosis, as it is a common comorbidity with SSc.

Checking an antisynthetase antibody panel can help confirm the diagnosis of SSc, as antisynthetase antibodies are commonly found in patients with this condition. The presence of these antibodies can also help differentiate SSc from other autoimmune diseases that may present with similar symptoms.

Option A, arranging a percutaneous lung tissue biopsy, may not be necessary at this point in the patient's evaluation, as the chest CT scan already showed bibasilar pulmonary consolidations and ground glass opacities, which are consistent with lung involvement in SSc. A lung biopsy may be considered later in the patient's management if there is a need to assess disease progression or response to treatment.

Option C, performing a quadriceps muscle biopsy, is not typically performed in the evaluation of SSc, as muscle involvement is not a common feature of the disease.

Option D, prescribing 10 days of prednisone (60 mg daily), may be considered as a treatment option for SSc-related lung disease, but it is not the next step in the patient's evaluation. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a more severe disease, and treatment with corticosteroids should be individualized based on the patient's response to therapy and disease severity.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: Check an antisynthetase antibody panel.

**Answer**: C. Pediatric fibromyxoid soft tissue tumor

The correct answer is C. Pediatric fibromyxoid soft tissue tumor because it is a rare benign tumor that can occur in the oropharynx and hypopharynx, as described in the case. The patient's symptoms of dysphagia and dyspnea, as well as the physical examination findings of fullness in the left oropharynx and neck, are consistent with a mass in the oropharynx. The computed tomography imaging with contrast findings of a 4.6 × 4.0 × 8.0-cm heterogeneously enhancing mass in the left oropharynx and hypopharynx with cystic components and clear planes separating the mass from the spinal musculature and carotid sheath are also consistent with a fibromyxoid soft tissue tumor.

Option A, perineurioma, is an uncommon benign tumor that arises from the peripheral nerves. While it can occur in the head and neck, it is not typically found in the oropharynx or hypopharynx.

Option B, fibroblastic lipoblastoma, is a rare benign tumor that typically occurs in the soft tissues of the extremities. While it can occur in the head and neck, it is not typically found in the oropharynx or hypopharynx.

Option D, Schwannoma, is a benign tumor that arises from the supporting cells of the peripheral nerves. While it can occur in the head and neck, it is not typically found in the oropharynx or hypopharynx.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and imaging results, the most likely diagnosis is a pediatric fibromyxoid soft tissue tumor.

**Answer**:C. Order anti-GQ1b antibody and start intravenous immune globulin

The correct answer is C. Order anti-GQ1b antibody and start intravenous immune globulin.

The patient's symptoms of sudden-onset bilateral mydriasis, ophthalmoplegia, and ataxia, along with the physical examination findings of fixed and dilated pupils, sluggish but reactive pupils, and bilateral diminished reflexes, are consistent with a diagnosis of acute ophthalmoplegic migraine. This is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition that requires prompt recognition and treatment.

The presence of diffuse enhancement of the lower thoracic and cauda equina nerve roots and enhancement of the left oculomotor nerve on magnetic resonance imaging suggests inflammation and demyelination of the nerves, which is consistent with the diagnosis of acute ophthalmoplegic migraine.

Intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) is a first-line treatment for acute ophthalmoplegic migraine, as it has been shown to be effective in reducing inflammation and improving symptoms. IVIG works by blocking the activity of harmful antibodies and reducing inflammation in the nerves.

Ordering anti-GQ1b antibody is also appropriate because it can help confirm the diagnosis of acute ophthalmoplegic migraine. Anti-GQ1b antibodies are commonly found in patients with this condition, and their presence can support the diagnosis.

The other options are not appropriate for the following reasons:

A. Repeat blood cultures and start antibiotics: This option is not appropriate because there is no evidence of infection, and the patient's symptoms and examination findings are not consistent with infection.

B. Repeat lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid studies: This option is not appropriate because the patient has already had a lumbar puncture with normal cerebrospinal fluid studies, and repeat lumbar puncture is not likely to provide additional useful information.

**Answer**:C. Melanoma

The patient's symptoms and test results indicate that the most likely diagnosis is melanoma. The patient's age and job as a construction worker suggest that he spends a lot of time outdoors, increasing his risk of developing skin cancer. The patient's limited shoulder mobility and negative personal and familial oncologic history also support this diagnosis.

The physical examination findings of a large, fungating, necrotic, and ulcerated mass on the left shoulder are consistent with melanoma. The punch biopsy results, which showed sheets of highly pleomorphic atypical spindle and epithelial cells within the superficial and deep dermis, extending into the subcutaneous tissue, and with 18 mitoses/mm2, are also consistent with melanoma. The immunohistochemistry results, which demonstrated SOX10-positive and pankeratin-negative tumor cells, further support this diagnosis.

The whole-body positron emission tomographic and computed tomographic scan results, which revealed an intensely hypermetabolic left shoulder mass and multiple hypermetabolic enlarged left axillary lymph nodes, with no distant metastases, are also consistent with melanoma.

Squamous cell carcinoma (choice A) is less likely because it typically affects sun-exposed areas and is more common in older adults. Basal cell carcinoma (choice B) is unlikely because it typically appears as a small, shiny bump or nodule and is less aggressive than melanoma. Merkel cell carcinoma (choice D) is rare and typically affects the head and neck, making it less likely than melanoma in this case.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, test results, and medical history, the most likely diagnosis is melanoma.

**Answer**: B. Stop prednisone and proceed with diagnostic vitrectomy

The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest retinal vasculitis with bilateral retinal detachments. The presence of vitritis and vasculitis intraoperatively, as well as the negative result of vitreous biopsy cytology, suggest a possible diagnosis of retinal vasculitis. The patient's history of B-cell lymphoma and active renal cell carcinoma (RCC) increases the likelihood of a systemic inflammatory condition.

Option B, stopping prednisone and proceeding with diagnostic vitrectomy, is the correct answer because it allows for a definitive diagnosis of retinal vasculitis and potentially identifies the underlying cause of the condition. Vitrectomy can provide a tissue sample for further analysis, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or histopathology, to confirm the diagnosis of retinal vasculitis. Additionally, diagnostic vitrectomy can help to identify any potential retinal tears or other structural abnormalities that may be contributing to the retinal detachment.

Option A, vitreous tap and inject intravitreal foscarnet, vancomycin, and ceftazidime, may be appropriate for treating bacterial or fungal endophthalmitis, but it is not the best option for diagnosing retinal vasculitis. Intravitreal injection of antibiotics and antiviral medications may not provide a definitive diagnosis and may not address the underlying cause of the condition.

Option C, stopping cabozantinib and admitting for intravenous solumedrol, may be appropriate for managing systemic inflammatory conditions, but it is not the best option for diagnosing retinal vasculitis. Intravenous solumedrol may help to reduce inflammation, but it may not address the underlying cause of the condition, and it may not provide a definitive diagnosis.

Option D, magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits followed by lumbar puncture, may be appropriate for evaluating the extent of inflammation and identifying any potential central nervous system involvement, but it is not the

**Answer**:A. Obtain MRI of the left shoulder

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, along with the radiographic evidence of complete destruction of the proximal humeral head, suggest that the patient has a significant musculoskeletal issue that requires further evaluation. MRI is the best imaging modality to evaluate the soft tissues and bony structures of the shoulder joint, including the humeral head, and can help identify the cause of the patient's symptoms. MRI can also assess the extent of the syrinx and any potential compression on the spinal cord or nerve roots.

Choice B, Order serum tumor marker testing, is not relevant to the patient's current symptoms and physical examination findings. While tumor marker testing may be appropriate in certain cases of shoulder pain, it is not the next step in this patient's evaluation.

Choice C, Orthopedic surgery evaluation for shoulder replacement surgery, may be a consideration in the future, but it is not the most appropriate next step. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest that there may be a reversible cause of the humeral head destruction, and further evaluation is needed before considering surgical intervention.

Choice D, Perform an urgent left shoulder joint aspiration, may be a consideration if the patient had a suspected infection or inflammatory condition, but it is not the most appropriate next step based on the patient's current symptoms and physical examination findings.

**Answer**: C. Percutaneous coronary intervention

Explanation:

A. Observation: While observation may be appropriate for some cases of spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD), it is not the best choice for this patient. The patient presented with acute chest pain, shortness of breath, and hypoxemia, which suggests a high-risk situation. Additionally, the patient has a history of recurrent preeclampsia, which increases her risk for cardiovascular complications. Observation may not address the underlying cause of the dissection and may lead to further complications.

B. Medical management: Medical management may be appropriate for some cases of SCAD, but it is not the best choice for this patient. While medications such as blood pressure-lowering agents, antiplatelet agents, and anticoagulants may be used to manage symptoms and reduce the risk of complications, they do not address the underlying dissection. In this case, the patient's symptoms are severe, and medical management alone may not be sufficient to resolve the dissection.

D. Coronary artery bypass grafting: Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) may be appropriate for some cases of SCAD, but it is not the best choice for this patient. CABG is a surgical procedure that involves bypassing the blocked coronary artery with a healthy blood vessel. While it may be effective in some cases, it is a more invasive procedure than percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and may not be necessary for this patient. PCI is a less invasive procedure that can be used to open up the blocked coronary artery using a balloon or stent.

C. Percutaneous coronary intervention: PCI is the best choice for this patient. PCI is a minimally invasive procedure that can be used to open up the blocked coronary artery using a balloon or stent. It is a more appropriate choice than CABG because it is less invasive and can be performed in a timely manner. Additionally, PCI can be performed in a cardiac catheterization laboratory, which is equipped with the necessary equipment and personnel to handle emergency situations.

**Answer**:B. VEXAS (vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, and somatic) syndrome

The patient's symptoms and lab results are consistent with VEXAS syndrome, a rare autoinflammatory disorder caused by mutations in the E1 enzyme. The patient's history of treatment resistance and the absence of other autoimmune diseases, such as lupus, also support this diagnosis.

A. Drug-induced SCLE is unlikely since the patient's symptoms have been present for 5 years, and there is no history of medication use that could cause this condition.

C. Histiocytoid Sweet syndrome is a rare condition that presents with fever, skin lesions, and histiocytic infiltrates, but it is not associated with vacuoles or E1 enzyme mutations.

D. Halogenoderma is a rare condition that presents with skin lesions and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, but it is not associated with vacuoles, E1 enzyme mutations, or the patient's other symptoms.

Therefore, B. VEXAS syndrome is the most likely diagnosis for this patient.

**Answer**: C. Pseudoxanthoma elasticum–like disorder with coagulation deficiency

The correct answer is C, Pseudoxanthoma elasticum–like disorder with coagulation deficiency, because it best matches the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the elastic tissue in the skin, eyes, and blood vessels. It is characterized by progressive skin laxity, yellowish coalesced papules on the flexural areas, and a high risk of cardiovascular complications. The patient's symptoms, such as progressive skin laxity, yellowish papules, and lack of extracutaneous involvement, are consistent with PXE. However, the patient's laboratory results show a low clotting activity of factor X and a prolonged prothrombin time, which are not typical of PXE.

Inherited cutis laxa syndrome (ICLS) is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by loose, wrinkled, and inelastic skin. It can also cause respiratory problems, gastrointestinal issues, and other systemic complications. The patient's symptoms do not match the typical presentation of ICLS, as the patient does not have respiratory or gastrointestinal issues, and the skin laxity is not as severe as in ICLS.

Pseudoxanthoma elasticum–like disorder with coagulation deficiency is a rare variant of PXE that is characterized by a combination of PXE symptoms and coagulation abnormalities. This variant is often associated with a higher risk of bleeding and thrombosis. The patient's laboratory results, which show a low clotting activity of factor X and a prolonged prothrombin time, are consistent with this diagnosis.

**Answer**:B. Obtain serologic testing for E granulosus antibodies

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest the possibility of an Echinococcus granulosus infection. The presence of a large pulmonary cyst and liver cysts, along with an elevated eosinophil count and normal acid-fast bacilli smear microscopy and HIV antibody testing, are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's exposure to dogs, cattle, and sheep also increases the likelihood of an Echinococcus infection.

Serologic testing for E granulosus antibodies is the most appropriate next step in diagnosing this infection. This test can detect the presence of antibodies against Echinococcus granulosus in the patient's blood, which would confirm the diagnosis.

Option A, checking stool for Echinococcus granulosus eggs, may also be useful in diagnosing this infection, but it is not the most appropriate next step. The presence of eggs in the stool would confirm the diagnosis, but the absence of eggs does not rule out the infection, as the patient may not have passed eggs in their stool yet.

Option C, ordering a lung biopsy, may be necessary later on in the diagnosis and treatment of the patient's pulmonary cyst, but it is not the most appropriate next step. A lung biopsy would provide a tissue sample for further examination, but it would not confirm the diagnosis of an Echinococcus infection.

Option D, performing a liver biopsy, is not necessary at this time. While the patient does have liver cysts, the diagnosis of an Echinococcus infection is more pressing and should be addressed first. A liver biopsy may be considered later on in the patient's treatment, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this time.

The correct answer is C: Send skin biopsy specimen to the US National Hansen’s Disease Program for PCR testing.

Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease, is a chronic bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium leprae. The patient's symptoms, including skin lesions, numbness, and hand contractures, are consistent with leprosy. The fact that the patient recently immigrated from Samoa, where leprosy is still endemic, increases the likelihood of this diagnosis.

Option C is the correct answer because it involves sending the skin biopsy specimen to a reference laboratory for PCR testing, which is the most sensitive and specific method for diagnosing leprosy. PCR can detect the genetic material of M. leprae in skin tissue, and it is the gold standard for diagnosing leprosy.

Option A, incubating the skin biopsy specimen on chocolate agar, is not the best choice because it is not a specific or sensitive method for diagnosing leprosy. Chocolate agar is a medium used to grow mycobacteria, but it may not detect M. leprae, which grows slowly and requires specialized media and conditions.

Option B, obtaining serologic testing for M. leprae phenolic glycolipid 1, may be helpful in some cases, but it is not the most appropriate choice in this scenario. Serologic testing can detect antibodies against M. leprae in the blood, but it may not be positive in all cases, especially in the early stages of infection. Moreover, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are more consistent with a diagnosis of leprosy than with other conditions that may cause similar symptoms, such as tuberculosis or syphilis.

Option D, treating with dapsone, rifampin, and clofazimine, is not the best choice because it is not appropriate to treat a patient without a confirmed diagnosis. Dapsone, rifampin, and clofazimine are medications used to treat leprosy, but they should only

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is B. Order genetic testing.

The patient's presentation of heart failure, neuropathy, and spinal stenosis, along with the laboratory results of high-sensitivity troponin, brain-type natriuretic peptide, and abnormal liver enzymes, suggest a potential diagnosis of a cardiac amyloidosis, such as light chain (AL) amyloidosis. Genetic testing can help confirm this diagnosis by identifying the presence of a genetic mutation associated with the disease.

Option A, Perform bone marrow biopsy, may be considered, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. While bone marrow biopsy can be used to diagnose AL amyloidosis, it is not as sensitive as genetic testing, and a negative result does not rule out the diagnosis. Additionally, bone marrow biopsy carries a higher risk of complications compared to genetic testing.

Option C, Perform random skin biopsies, is not a recommended diagnostic test for cardiac amyloidosis. Skin biopsy may be used to diagnose certain types of amyloidosis, such as cutaneous amyloidosis, but it is not useful for diagnosing cardiac amyloidosis.

Option D, Order 24-hour urine testing for monoclonal proteins, may also be considered, but it is not as specific as genetic testing for diagnosing AL amyloidosis. Urine protein electrophoresis can identify M-protein, but it may not detect light chain disease, which is the most common type of AL amyloidosis.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in this case is to order genetic testing to confirm the diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis.

**Answer**:D. Magnetic resonance imaging with magnetic resonance angiography or digital subtraction angiography

The correct answer is D, Magnetic resonance imaging with magnetic resonance angiography or digital subtraction angiography, because it is the most appropriate diagnostic test to evaluate the choroidal detachment and potential underlying causes in this case.

A, Ultrasound biomicroscopy, is not the best choice because it is an imaging technique that provides high-resolution cross-sectional images of the eye but does not provide information about the blood vessels or choroidal circulation.

B, Uveitis workup and steroids, is not the best choice because uveitis is not the primary diagnosis in this case. While uveitis may be a potential complication of choroidal detachment, it is not the most pressing concern in this patient's presentation.

C, Thyroid profile, is not the best choice because there is no indication of thyroid disease in this patient's presentation. While thyroid disease can cause ocular symptoms, it is not related to the patient's reported symptoms of diminution of vision, redness, and pain in the right eye.

D, Magnetic resonance imaging with magnetic resonance angiography or digital subtraction angiography, is the best choice because it can provide detailed information about the choroidal circulation, potential vasculitis or other inflammatory conditions, and any other intraocular or orbital abnormalities that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. This information is essential in determining the underlying cause of the choroidal detachment and developing an appropriate treatment plan.

**Answer**:D. Schedule combined phacoemulsification-vitrectomy surgery

The correct answer is D. Schedule combined phacoemulsification-vitrectomy surgery because it is the most appropriate step to address the patient's sudden decrease in visual acuity and the observed reverse pupillary block.

Performing peripheral iridotomy (A) may be a necessary step in some cases of pupillary block, but it is not the most appropriate choice in this scenario. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a more severe and complex issue than a simple pupillary block, and iridotomy may not effectively address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

Performing full-thickness sclerectomy (B) is not the most appropriate choice because it is a more invasive procedure that may not be necessary at this stage. The patient's symptoms and examination findings do not suggest the need for a full-thickness sclerectomy, and a less invasive approach should be attempted first.

Administering intravenous corticosteroids (C) may be a useful adjunctive treatment in some cases of uveitis, but it is not the most appropriate choice in this scenario. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a more mechanical issue than an inflammatory one, and corticosteroids may not effectively address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

Scheduling combined phacoemulsification-vitrectomy surgery (D) is the most appropriate choice because it allows for the removal of the cataract and the vitrectomy that may be necessary to address the reverse pupillary block and the inferior retinal detachment. This approach allows for a comprehensive evaluation of the patient's condition and provides the best opportunity for a successful outcome.

**Answer**: C. Intravitreal steroid injection

Explanation:

A. Immunomodulatory therapy with another course of oral steroids may be effective in treating inflammatory conditions, but it may not be the best choice for this patient's current condition. The patient has already received high-dose steroids previously, and the inflammation has not fully resolved. Additionally, the patient's history of melanoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia suggests that immunosuppression may not be the best approach.

B. Pars plana vitrectomy for vitreous biopsy with or without chorioretinal biopsy for flow cytometry to assess for leukemic cells may be a diagnostic option, but it is not the most appropriate choice at this time. The patient has already had a significant decline in visual acuity, and a vitrectomy may not address the underlying cause of the vision loss. Additionally, the patient's history of melanoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia suggests that a malignancy may not be the cause of the vision loss.

C. Intravitreal steroid injection is a targeted treatment that can address the inflammation in the eye and potentially improve vision. The patient's history of uveitis and retinal pigment epithelial loss suggests that inflammation is a significant component of their condition. Intravitreal steroid injection can deliver a high dose of steroid directly to the affected area, potentially reducing inflammation and improving vision.

D. Observation may not be the best approach, as the patient's vision has already declined significantly, and there is no clear indication that observation will improve their condition. The patient's history of melanoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia suggests that close monitoring is necessary, but observation alone may not be sufficient to address the underlying cause of the vision loss.

Therefore, C. Intravitreal steroid injection is the most appropriate answer.

The correct answer is B: Venous malformation.

A venous malformation is a type of vascular anomaly that occurs when there is a defect in the development of the veins. It is characterized by a cluster of enlarged veins that can cause symptoms such as pain, swelling, and discomfort. In this case, the patient's symptoms of left jaw tightness, aural fullness, and facial discomfort, as well as the MRI findings of a well-circumscribed, ovoid mass in the left prestyloid PPS that measured 12 × 15 × 22 mm, are consistent with a venous malformation. The heterogeneous enhancement following gadolinium administration on the MRI also supports this diagnosis.

Schwannoma, also known as a neurilemmoma, is a benign tumor that originates from the supporting cells of the nervous system called Schwann cells. It is usually slow-growing and may not cause any symptoms in the early stages. However, the patient's symptoms and MRI findings do not suggest a Schwannoma.

Pleomorphic adenoma is a type of salivary gland tumor that can occur in the parotid gland or other salivary glands. It is characterized by a mixture of epithelial and myoepithelial cells, and can have a variety of appearances on MRI. However, the location of the mass in the left prestyloid PPS and the patient's symptoms do not suggest a pleomorphic adenoma.

Paraganglioma is a type of rare tumor that originates from the paraganglia, which are clusters of cells located near the sympathetic nerve fibers. It can cause symptoms such as headache, sweating, and flushing, but the patient's symptoms and MRI findings do not suggest a paraganglioma.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: Venous malformation.

**Answer**:C. Invasive fungal sinusitis (mucormycosis) with perineural spread

The patient's symptoms of left-sided facial weakness and swelling, along with the physical examination findings of left lower-motor-neuron type of facial nerve palsy, are consistent with a neurological disorder affecting the left facial nerve. The patient's history of recurrent high-grade serous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary and recent chemotherapy treatment suggest a possible metastatic spread to the brain. However, the MRI of the brain did not reveal any neuroparenchymal or meningeal lesions, which makes metastasis less likely.

The maxillary sinus lesion shown on the MRI is consistent with invasive fungal sinusitis (mucormycosis), which can cause perineural spread and involve the facial nerve. The patient's history of recent chemotherapy and the presence of mucosal thickening in the maxillary sinuses, which is intermediate to hypointense on T2-weighted imaging and hypointense on T1-weighted imaging with postcontrast enhancement, support this diagnosis. The involvement of the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve via intercommunication between the auriculotemporal branch of trigeminal nerve and the intraparotid facial nerve, as well as the diffuse enhancement and thickening of the entire extracranial left facial nerve, are also consistent with invasive fungal sinusitis.

The other choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.

A. Maxillary carcinoma with perineural spread: This diagnosis is less likely because the patient's history of recent chemotherapy and the absence of any neuroparenchymal or meningeal lesions on the MRI of the brain make it unlikely that the maxillary sinus lesion is a carcinoma. Additionally, the involvement of the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve and the diffuse enhancement and thickening of the entire extracranial left facial nerve are not typical features of maxill

**Answer**: D. Localized amyloidosis (amyloidoma)

The correct answer is D. Localized amyloidosis (amyloidoma) because it best matches the clinical and histopathological features described in the case.

A. Fibroma is an incorrect choice because it is a benign tumor of connective tissue origin, which does not match the acellular, amorphous, and eosinophilic material arranged in lobules observed in the biopsy specimen.

B. Granular cell tumor is an incorrect choice because it is a rare benign tumor that typically presents as a painless mass in the oral cavity, and is composed of cells with granular cytoplasm. The histopathological features described in the case do not match the characteristic appearance of a granular cell tumor.

C. Median rhomboid glossitis (nodular variant) is an incorrect choice because it is a rare inflammatory condition that affects the tongue, characterized by a nodular or polypoid lesion on the midline of the tongue. The histopathological features described in the case do not match the characteristic appearance of median rhomboid glossitis.

D. Localized amyloidosis (amyloidoma) is the correct choice because it is a rare benign condition characterized by the accumulation of amyloid material in a localized area, which can occur in various organs, including the tongue. The acellular, amorphous, and eosinophilic material arranged in lobules observed in the biopsy specimen is consistent with the characteristic appearance of localized amyloidosis.

**Answer**:B. Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, as well as the results of the punch biopsy, are consistent with a diagnosis of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN). BPDCN is a rare and aggressive hematologic malignancy that typically affects older adults and is characterized by the presence of violaceous plaques on the skin, which are often mistaken for bruises or ecchymoses.

The patient's medical history of atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and use of anticoagulation medication increases the likelihood of BPDCN, as this condition is often associated with a history of cardiovascular disease. The presence of nonspecific skin-colored plaques on the chest and a 1.8 × 2.5-cm erythematous plaque on the left lower back, as well as the absence of appreciable lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly, are also consistent with BPDCN.

The peripheral blood test results show a low hemoglobin level, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and a high absolute neutrophil count, which are all consistent with BPDCN. The elevated lactate dehydrogenase level suggests increased cellular turnover, which is also consistent with BPDCN.

The punch biopsy findings show a grenz zone and infiltrate extending into the deeper dermis, which is consistent with BPDCN. The cellular infiltrate composed of basophilic blastoid cells and the positive staining for CD123 are also consistent with BPDCN, as this condition is characterized by the proliferation of abnormal plasmacytoid dendritic cells that express CD123.

In contrast, metastatic renal cell carcinoma (choice A) typically presents with a history of flank pain, hematuria, and weight loss, and is less likely to cause ecchymotic plaques on the scalp. Epithelioid angiosar

**Answer**: C. Histiocytoid Sweet syndrome

The correct answer is C. Histiocytoid Sweet syndrome because it matches the clinical and histopathological features described in the case.

Histiocytoid Sweet syndrome is a rare adverse event associated with chemotherapy, particularly with drugs that target CD20, such as rituximab. It is characterized by fever, skin rash, and pancytopenia, which are all present in this case. The patient's history of recurrent IgG-κ multiple myeloma and recent initiation of chemotherapy with ixazomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone increases the likelihood of this diagnosis.

The clinical image shown in Figure A demonstrates annular erythematous plaques on the chest, which is consistent with the characteristic skin lesions of Histiocytoid Sweet syndrome. The histopathological image in Figure B reveals an inflammatory infiltrate of predominantly mononuclear cells in the superficial and mid dermis, which is also consistent with Histiocytoid Sweet syndrome. The predominantly infiltrated cells show large, elongated, vesicular nuclei, single inconspicuous nucleoli, and scant, slightly eosinophilic cytoplasm, as seen in Figure C. These features are consistent with the histopathological findings of Histiocytoid Sweet syndrome.

Immunohistochemical staining for myeloperoxidase, as shown in Figure D, is also supportive of the diagnosis, as myeloperoxidase-positive cells are commonly seen in Histiocytoid Sweet syndrome.

In contrast, cutaneous involvement of multiple myeloma (choice A) is less likely given the absence of typical myeloma skin lesions such as lichenoid eruptions, papillomatoses, or amyloidosis. Erythema multiforme (choice B) can present with similar skin lesions, but it is usually associated with herpes simplex virus infection, which is not mentioned in the case. C

**Answer**: D. Takayasu arteritis

Explanation:

The correct diagnosis is Takayasu arteritis, which is a rare inflammatory disease that affects the aorta and its branches, including the renal arteries. The patient's symptoms of headache, seizures, and altered consciousness, along with the physical examination findings of hypertension, abdominal bruit, and fundus changes consistent with hypertensive retinopathy, are all consistent with this diagnosis. The imaging findings of bilateral white matter hyperintensity on MRI and narrowing of the right renal artery on CT angiography also support this diagnosis.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Moyamoya disease with renovascular hypertension: While Moyamoya disease is a condition that can cause bilateral internal carotid artery stenosis or occlusion, leading to cerebral hypoperfusion and symptoms similar to those presented by the patient, it is not associated with renovascular hypertension. Additionally, the patient's imaging findings do not support this diagnosis.

B. Atherosclerotic disease: Atherosclerosis is a condition that causes narrowing or blockage of the arteries due to the buildup of plaque, but it typically affects older adults and is not associated with the patient's symptoms or imaging findings.

C. Fibromuscular dysplasia: Fibromuscular dysplasia is a condition that affects the blood vessels, leading to narrowing or blockage, but it typically affects the carotid or vertebral arteries, not the renal arteries. Additionally, the patient's imaging findings do not support this diagnosis.

Therefore, the correct diagnosis is Takayasu arteritis, a rare inflammatory disease that affects the aorta and its branches, including the renal arteries, and can cause symptoms and imaging findings consistent with those presented by the patient.

**Answer**:B. Obtain skin biopsy with T-cell clonality studies

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with pemphigus, a group of autoimmune bullous diseases that affect the skin and mucous membranes. Pemphigus is characterized by the formation of blisters and sores on the skin and mucous membranes, which can be painful and can lead to scarring and disfigurement. The patient's history of a pruritic exanthem that began on his scalp and face and spread across most of his body over a 2-month period, along with the presence of confluent salmon-colored plaques composed of folliculocentric scaly papules across his body, waxy, exfoliative scale on the volar aspect of his hands and feet, and thickened, onycholytic nails, are all consistent with pemphigus.

The correct answer, B. Obtain skin biopsy with T-cell clonality studies, is the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation. A skin biopsy can help to confirm the diagnosis of pemphigus by identifying the characteristic histopathologic features of the disease, such as acantholysis (the loss of the adhesion between keratinocytes in the epidermis) and the presence of immune cells in the dermis. T-cell clonality studies can also be performed on the skin biopsy specimen to identify the presence of T cells that are specific to the patient's skin antigens, which can help to confirm the diagnosis of pemphigus.

The other answer choices are not the most appropriate next steps in the patient's evaluation.

A. Order a myositis-specific autoantibody panel: Myositis-specific autoantibodies are not typically associated with pemphigus, and ordering this test would not help to confirm the diagnosis.

The correct answer is C. Provide reassurance and prescribe oral care.

Let's go through each answer choice and explain why it's incorrect or correct:

A. Measure serum cortisol level:
This choice is incorrect because cortisol levels are not typically associated with tongue discoloration. While cortisol is a steroid hormone produced by the adrenal gland that plays a crucial role in the body's response to stress, it does not directly affect the tongue or cause discoloration. Therefore, measuring serum cortisol levels would not help diagnose or treat the patient's tongue discoloration.

B. Perform a tongue biopsy:
This choice is incorrect because a biopsy would not be necessary to diagnose the patient's condition. The patient's symptoms, along with the physical examination findings and laboratory results, already point to a diagnosis of subscapularis pyomyositis and tongue discoloration. A biopsy would not provide any additional information and would be an unnecessary invasive procedure.

D. Stop cefazolin:
This choice is incorrect because cefazolin is an appropriate antibiotic for the patient's infection. The patient has pyomyositis, which is an infection of the muscles, and cefazolin is effective against Staphylococcus aureus, the bacteria that caused the infection. Stopping the antibiotic would not address the underlying infection and could lead to further complications.

C. Provide reassurance and prescribe oral care:
This choice is correct because it addresses the patient's concern about the tongue discoloration and provides appropriate treatment. The patient's tongue discoloration is likely due to a reaction to the antibiotic, cefazolin. The discoloration is a known side effect of the medication and is usually temporary. Providing reassurance to the patient and prescribing oral care, such as mouthwashes and topical anesthetics, can help alleviate any discomfort and promote healing.

In summary, option C is the correct answer because it addresses the patient's concern, provides appropriate treatment, and does not involve unnecessary invas

The correct answer is C. Hairy pharyngeal polyp because it best matches the patient's symptoms and the physical examination findings described in the case.

A. Teratoma is an incorrect choice because it is a type of benign tumor that can occur in various parts of the body, including the oropharynx. However, teratomas are typically composed of a mixture of tissues from all three embryonic layers (ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm), whereas the lesion described in the case appears to have both ectodermal and mesodermal components but no endodermal component.

B. Dermoid cyst is an incorrect choice because it is a type of benign growth that originates from ectodermal tissue and typically contains skin appendages such as hair follicles, sweat glands, and sebaceous glands. While the lesion described in the case does contain pilosebaceous units, including hair follicles, arrector pili muscles, and sebaceous glands, it also contains a keratinizing squamous epithelium with Actinomyces colonization, which is not typically seen in dermoid cysts.

D. Squamous papilloma is an incorrect choice because it is a type of benign tumor that arises from squamous epithelium and typically presents as a slow-growing, painless mass in the oropharynx. While the lesion described in the case does have a squamous epithelial component, it also contains pilosebaceous units and a stalk, which are not typical features of squamous papillomas.

**Answer**:C. Obtain a sample of the hypopyon through anterior chamber paracentesis and inject intravitreal antibiotics

The correct answer is C. Obtain a sample of the hypopyon through anterior chamber paracentesis and inject intravitreal antibiotics.

The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest bilateral hypopyon, which is an inflammatory condition that can be caused by various factors, including infection, inflammatory diseases, and tumors. The patient's recent chemotherapy and history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) increase the likelihood of an infectious etiology.

Option A, observing the patient without intervention, is not appropriate because the patient's symptoms and examination findings indicate a severe inflammatory condition that requires prompt treatment. Delaying treatment may lead to further vision loss and other complications.

Option B, performing pars plana vitrectomy, is not the best choice for several reasons. First, the patient's inflammation is primarily in the anterior segment, and vitrectomy would not address the underlying cause of the hypopyon. Second, vitrectomy is a more invasive procedure that carries risks, such as retinal detachment, cataract formation, and glaucoma, which may not be justified in this case.

Option D, awaiting results from systemic laboratory tests and blood culture, is also not the best choice. While it is important to identify the underlying cause of the hypopyon, the patient's symptoms and examination findings indicate a severe inflammatory condition that requires prompt treatment. Delaying treatment until the results of laboratory tests are available may lead to further vision loss and other complications.

In contrast, option C, obtaining a sample of the hypopyon through anterior chamber paracentesis and injecting intravitreal antibiotics, is a more appropriate approach. This procedure allows for the collection of a sample for further analysis and the administration of antibiotics directly into the affected eye, which can help to reduce inflammation and prevent further vision loss. Additionally, this approach is less invasive than vitrectomy and carries fewer risks.

**Answer**:A. Review brain MRI and order electroretinogram

The correct answer is A, "Review brain MRI and order electroretinogram" because it is essential to further evaluate the patient's brain function and visual pathway to determine the underlying cause of her nystagmus. The patient's history of esophageal atresia, small bowel obstruction, mild cognitive impairment, low tone, and increased reflexes suggests that there may be a neurological component to her condition.

Choice B, "Refer for strabismus surgery," is incorrect because strabismus surgery is typically performed to align the eyes in cases of strabismus, not to address nystagmus. Nystagmus is a condition where the eyes move involuntarily, and surgery would not address the underlying cause of the abnormal eye movements.

Choice C, "Order genetic workup," may be appropriate in some cases of nystagmus, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. While genetic testing may reveal a potential cause of the nystagmus, it is unlikely to provide a clear diagnosis or guide treatment in this case, given the patient's history of multiple congenital anomalies.

Choice D, "Treat with clonazepam," is also incorrect. Clonazepam is a medication that can be used to treat certain types of nystagmus, but it is not appropriate in this case. The patient's nystagmus is not caused by a benign essential tremor, which is the typical indication for clonazepam. Moreover, the patient's age and medical history suggest that the nystagmus is likely related to a more complex underlying condition that requires further evaluation before treatment.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to review the brain MRI and order an electroretinogram (ERG) to further evaluate the patient's visual pathway and potential neurological causes of her nystagmus. The ERG test measures the electrical activity of the retina in response to light and can help identify any abnormalities in the visual pathway. The results of these tests can help guide further management and treatment.

**Answer**: B. Pyoderma gangrenosum

Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare, ulcerative skin condition that is often associated with hematological malignancies, such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), which the patient in the case has. The patient's presentation of multiple nonhealing skin ulcers on the chest and upper extremities, which developed rapidly and did not respond to treatment for shingles or antibiotics, is consistent with pyoderma gangrenosum.

The patient's history of taking lenalidomide, a medication that can cause skin lesions, and the absence of other significant adverse effects, supports the diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum. The patient's lab results, including a white blood cell count of 16.2 × 103/μL, an absolute neutrophil count of 12.7 × 103/μL, and a platelet count of 262 × 103/μL, are also consistent with pyoderma gangrenosum, as the condition is often associated with leukocytosis and thrombocytopenia.

The pathologic sampling from the skin lesions showed a dense dermal infiltrate with predominantly neutrophils, which is consistent with pyoderma gangrenosum. The immunohistochemical staining showed myeloperoxidase-positive neutrophils, which supports the diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum.

Leukemia cutis (choice A) is a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's history of MDS and the absence of circulating blasts in the blood. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis (choice C) is also a possibility, but it is less likely given the absence of histopathological evidence of vasculitis. Lymphomatoid papulosis (choice D) is unlikely given the patient's history of MDS and the absence of lymphoma.

Therefore, based on the patient's history, physical examination, laboratory results, and pathologic findings, the most likely diagnosis is pyoderma gangrenosum

A. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be useful in evaluating the patient's visual symptoms, but it is not directly related to the patient's kidney disease or family history.

C. Vasculitis serological evaluation may be appropriate if the patient had symptoms or signs suggestive of vasculitis, but there is no mention of such symptoms in the case description.

D. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a diagnostic imaging modality that is not typically used to evaluate kidney disease or genetic disorders. It may be used to evaluate certain types of cancer, but it is not relevant to the patient's current symptoms or medical history.

**Answer**: D. Malignant myopericytoma

The correct answer is D. Malignant myopericytoma because it best matches the clinical and histopathological features described in the case.

A. Symplastic glomus tumor:
A symplastic glomus tumor is a rare benign tumor that originates from the glomus cells of the skin. It typically presents as a small, painful nodule on the fingers or toes. The histopathological features of a symplastic glomus tumor include a well-circumscribed nodule composed of uniform cells with a distinctive "salt and pepper" appearance. The tumor cells are positive for vimentin and negative for cytokeratin, which helps to distinguish them from other types of skin tumors.

In contrast, the case presented describes a tender, enlarging scalp lesion with overlying vessels, which is not consistent with the typical clinical presentation of a symplastic glomus tumor. Additionally, the histopathological features described, such as proliferation of tumor cells around small vessels with scattered mitoses and necrosis, are not consistent with the features of a symplastic glomus tumor.

B. Angioleiomyoma:
Angioleiomyoma is a rare benign tumor that originates from the smooth muscle cells of blood vessels. It typically presents as a small, painless nodule on the skin, often on the trunk or extremities. The histopathological features of an angioleiomyoma include a well-circumscribed nodule composed of smooth muscle cells with prominent nucleoli. The tumor cells are positive for smooth muscle actin and negative for cytokeratin.

In contrast, the case presented describes a tender, enlarging scalp lesion with overlying vessels, which is not consistent with the typical clinical presentation of an angioleiomyoma. Additionally, the histopathological features described, such as proliferation of tumor cells around small vessels with scattered mitoses and necrosis, are not consistent with the features of an angioleiomyoma.

The correct answer is D. Microvenular hemangioma.

A. Patch-stage Kaposi sarcoma: This is an incorrect choice because while Kaposi sarcoma can present with patches or plaques, it typically has a more irregular border and is associated with HIV infection or immunosuppression. The patient in this case is otherwise healthy and has no signs of immunosuppression.

B. Interstitial granulomatous dermatitis: This is an incorrect choice because while granulomatous dermatitis can present with violaceous patches and plaques, it typically has a more inflammatory appearance and is associated with a granulomatous response to a trigger such as an insect bite or local infection. The patient in this case has no signs of inflammation or a trigger.

C. Acquired progressive lymphangioma: This is an incorrect choice because while lymphangioma can present with patches or plaques, it typically has a more nodular appearance and is associated with lymphatic malformations. The patient in this case has no signs of lymphatic malformations.

D. Microvenular hemangioma: This is the correct choice because it can present with patches or plaques that are similar in appearance to the patient's lesions. Microvenular hemangioma is a benign vascular tumor that is composed of small, thin-walled blood vessels. The patient's skin biopsy showed irregularly branched, thin-walled blood vessels with plump endothelial cells, which is consistent with microvenular hemangioma. The patient's lack of symptoms and absence of extracutaneous involvement also support this diagnosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Microvenular hemangioma.

**Answer**:B. Discontinue amiodarone and administer a corticosteroid

The patient's symptoms of persistent pulmonary edema, despite adequate diuresis, and the radiographic findings of a reticular pattern predominantly in the perihilar area with consolidation and diffuse ground-glass opacity in both lung fields, are consistent with a diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's history of recent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and the use of amiodarone suggest that the likely cause of ARDS is drug-induced lung injury.

Amiodarone is a known cause of drug-induced lung injury, and discontinuation of the drug is the appropriate step in managing this complication. Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, are commonly used to treat drug-induced lung injury, as they have anti-inflammatory properties that can help reduce inflammation in the lungs and improve lung function.

Performing a lung biopsy (choice A) may be considered in some cases of ARDS, but it is not the most appropriate step in this patient's management. The patient's clinical presentation and radiographic findings are consistent with ARDS, and the risk of complications from a lung biopsy outweighs the potential benefits.

Performing bronchoalveolar lavage (choice C) may be useful in some cases of ARDS, but it is not the most appropriate step in this patient's management. The patient's clinical presentation and radiographic findings are consistent with ARDS, and the risk of complications from bronchoalveolar lavage outweighs the potential benefits.

Checking amiodarone plasma level (choice D) may be useful in monitoring the patient's response to the drug, but it is not the most appropriate step in managing the patient's current symptoms and diagnosis of ARDS.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: Discontinue amiodarone and administer a corticosteroid.

**Answer**:A. Implant a defibrillator

The patient in the case presented with recurrent syncope and frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), which are risk factors for sudden cardiac death. The patient's history of syncope and the presence of PVCs suggest that they may be at risk for ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, which can lead to sudden cardiac death.

Option A, implanting a defibrillator, is the correct answer because it addresses the patient's risk of sudden cardiac death by providing a means to deliver an electric shock to the heart in the event of a life-threatening arrhythmia. An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is a device that is implanted in the chest and can detect and correct abnormal heart rhythms. In patients with a high risk of sudden cardiac death, such as those with a history of syncope and frequent PVCs, an ICD can provide life-saving therapy.

Option B, performing provocative drug testing with procainamide, is not the correct answer because it is not a definitive test for assessing the patient's risk of sudden cardiac death. While procainamide can be used to induce PVCs and assess the patient's response to them, it is not a reliable method for predicting the risk of sudden cardiac death.

Option C, starting nadolol, is also not the correct answer. Nadolol is a beta-blocker that can be used to treat hypertension, angina, and certain heart rhythm disorders. However, it is not typically used to treat patients with a high risk of sudden cardiac death.

Option D, ablating PVCs, is not the correct answer because it does not address the patient's underlying risk of sudden cardiac death. While ablation therapy can be effective in reducing or eliminating PVCs, it is not a reliable method for reducing the risk of sudden cardiac death. In this case, the patient's history of syncope and frequent PVCs suggest that they may be at risk for life-threatening arrhythmias, and an ICD would be a more appropriate treatment option.

**Answer**: D. Plan for surgical intervention after intravenous fluid resuscitation in the intensive care unit (ICU)

The correct answer is D. Plan for surgical intervention after intravenous fluid resuscitation in the intensive care unit (ICU) because the patient's symptoms and diagnosis suggest a high likelihood of a surgical emergency. The patient's abdominal pain, distension, and vomiting, along with the presence of gallstones and a suspected fistula tract, indicate a potential bowel obstruction or perforation, which requires prompt surgical intervention.

Administering barium through the nasogastric tube (Option A) may be useful in evaluating for bowel obstruction, but it would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, which is likely a surgical emergency.

Ordering magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (Option B) may provide additional information about the biliary tree and pancreas, but it would not be the most appropriate next step in managing the patient's acute symptoms.

Performing an emergency explorative laparotomy (Option C) may be necessary in some cases, but it is not the best initial approach in this patient's case, as it would not allow for adequate resuscitation and stabilization of the patient before surgery.

Therefore, the best course of action is to plan for surgical intervention after intravenous fluid resuscitation in the intensive care unit (ICU), which would allow for close monitoring and stabilization of the patient's vital signs, as well as adequate preparation for surgery.

**Answer**: A. Check stool for ova and parasites

The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss, along with the physical examination findings of abdominal tenderness and petechial rash, suggest a possible gastrointestinal infection. The patient's history of bullous pemphigoid and recent episode of dyspnea on exertion also suggest a possible autoimmune component to her symptoms.

Checking the stool for ova and parasites is a reasonable first step in the workup of the patient's symptoms, as it can help identify a possible parasitic or ova-related cause of her gastrointestinal symptoms. This test can also help rule out other causes of gastrointestinal symptoms, such as inflammatory bowel disease or irritable bowel syndrome.

Obtaining a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panel for gastrointestinal pathogens (choice B) may also be useful in identifying a possible cause of the patient's symptoms, but it is not as specific as checking for ova and parasites and may not provide as much information about the patient's underlying condition.

Ordering measurement of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) level (choice C) may be relevant if the patient's symptoms were thought to be related to an autoimmune disorder, but it is not directly related to the patient's gastrointestinal symptoms.

Send blood for fungal culture (choice D) may also be relevant if the patient's symptoms were thought to be related to a fungal infection, but it is not as directly related to the patient's gastrointestinal symptoms as checking for ova and parasites.

Therefore, the correct answer is A. Check stool for ova and parasites.

**Answer**:B. Multivirus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)

The patient's history of CMV viremia and resistance to foscarnet and ganciclovir suggests that their immune system is unable to effectively clear the virus, leading to the development of vision-threatening retinal lesions. Systemic immunosuppression with cidofovir and CMV immune globulin may help to control the virus, but it may not be sufficient to reverse the existing retinal damage.

Option A, observation with systemic cidofovir and CMV immune globulin, may not be sufficient to improve the patient's vision, given the severity of the retinal lesions and the patient's history of resistance to previous treatments.

Option C, continued foscarnet and ganciclovir intravitreal injections, may be effective in controlling the virus, but the patient has already refused further injections due to pain and transiently decreased vision.

Option D, leflunomide initiation, is not directly related to the patient's CMV viremia and retinal lesions, and its use in this case would not address the underlying cause of the patient's vision loss.

Option B, multivirus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), offers a potential solution to the patient's resistance to previous treatments. CTLs are a type of immune cell that can be generated in vitro and expanded in culture to target specific viruses, including CMV. By using CTLs that are specific to multiple viruses, including CMV, the patient's immune system may be able to effectively clear the virus and improve their vision. This approach has been shown to be effective in other cases of CMV viremia and retinal lesions that are resistant to conventional treatments.

The correct answer is **B**: High-grade serous carcinoma of gynecological origin.

The patient's history of a hysterectomy for abnormal uterine bleeding and 20 years of estradiol use suggests a high likelihood of a gynecological origin for the cancer. The patient's age at the time of diagnosis (76 years old) and the high-grade nature of the tumor also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the immunohistochemical staining results, which showed positivity for PAX8, p53, and WT1, are consistent with a gynecological origin.

The other answer choices are less likely for the following reasons:

* **A**: Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid is a type of thyroid cancer that is typically slow-growing and has a better prognosis than high-grade serous carcinoma. The patient's history and clinical presentation do not suggest a thyroid primary.
* **C**: High-grade carcinoma of the breast with occult primary is a possibility, but the patient's history and clinical presentation suggest a more likely gynecological origin. The absence of any breast lesions on imaging also makes a breast primary less likely.
* **D**: High-grade papillary carcinoma of unknown primary is a possibility, but the patient's history and clinical presentation suggest a more likely gynecological origin. Additionally, the immunohistochemical staining results do not support a diagnosis of papillary carcinoma.

Therefore, based on the patient's history, clinical presentation, and immunohistochemical staining results, the most likely diagnosis is high-grade serous carcinoma of gynecological origin.

**Answer**: C. Cervical chondrocutaneous branchial remnant

The correct answer is C. Cervical chondrocutaneous branchial remnant because the patient's symptoms and the results of the physical examination, ultrasonography, and MRI are consistent with this diagnosis.

A branchial cleft cyst (choice A) is a type of congenital anomaly that occurs when the branchial cleft, which is a groove in the neck that forms during embryonic development, fails to close properly. However, the patient's mass was not located in the branchial cleft, but rather on the anterior-inferior third border of the left sternocleidomastoid muscle. Additionally, the patient's mass had a hairy surface, which is not consistent with a branchial cleft cyst.

An epidermoid cyst (choice B) is a type of benign growth that originates from the epidermis and is usually located in the skin or subcutaneous tissue. However, the patient's mass was not located in the skin or subcutaneous tissue, but rather in the anteromedial fascia of the left sternocleidomastoid muscle. Additionally, the presence of cartilage in the mass is not consistent with an epidermoid cyst.

A hair follicle nevus (choice D) is a type of benign growth that originates from the hair follicle. However, the patient's mass was not located in the hair-bearing area of the neck, but rather on the anterior-inferior third border of the left sternocleidomastoid muscle. Additionally, the presence of cartilage in the mass is not consistent with a hair follicle nevus.

A cervical chondrocutaneous branchial remnant (choice C) is a rare congenital anomaly that occurs when there is a failure of regression of the branchial cartilage during embryonic development. This results in a mass of cartilage that can be located in the neck, thorax, or abdomen.

**Answer**: C. Soft tissue aneurysmal bone cyst

The correct answer is C. Soft tissue aneurysmal bone cyst because it best matches the patient's symptoms and the results of the imaging studies.

A. Soft tissue giant cell tumor is an incorrect choice because, although it can present as a mass in the soft tissues, it typically has a more aggressive clinical course and is associated with a higher risk of local recurrence and metastasis. Additionally, the histopathological features of a soft tissue giant cell tumor are not consistent with the description of the lesion in the case, which showed a well-circumscribed lesion with peripheral casing of bone, cyst-like spaces filled with serous fluid, and walls of spindle-shaped fibroblasts.

B. Ossifying fibromyxoid tumor is also an incorrect choice because, although it can present as a slow-growing mass in the soft tissues, it typically has a more characteristic histopathological appearance, with a prominent myxoid matrix and a lack of bone formation. Additionally, ossifying fibromyxoid tumors are rare in children and young adults.

D. Soft tissue osteosarcoma is an incorrect choice because, although it can present as a mass in the soft tissues, it typically has a more aggressive clinical course and is associated with a higher risk of local recurrence and metastasis.

**Answer**: A. Pilonidal sinus

The correct answer is A, Pilonidal sinus, because it matches the patient's symptoms and the findings on physical examination and ultrasonography.

A Pilonidal sinus is a chronic infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue that occurs in the natal cleft or glans penis. It is characterized by a small opening or orifice on the surface of the skin, which can be surrounded by redness, swelling, and ulceration. The patient's symptoms of dyspareunia and recurrent, purulent discharge from his penis are consistent with a Pilonidal sinus.

The physical examination findings of an erythematous, pinpoint orifice on the glans penis, with peripheral telangiectasias and a linear bluish structure on dermoscopy, are also consistent with a Pilonidal sinus. The ultrasonography findings of a hypoechoic focal zone on the right side of the glans, with multiple hyperechoic bilaminar structures, suggest the presence of an abscess or inflammatory nodule, which is consistent with a Pilonidal sinus.

The other answer choices do not match the patient's symptoms or the findings on physical examination and ultrasonography.

B, Cutaneous larva migrans, is a skin infection caused by the larvae of certain parasites, such as hookworms or Strongyloides stercoralis. It is characterized by a linear, red, raised tract on the skin, with occasional nodules or vesicles. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest a cutaneous larva migrans infection.

C, Median raphe cyst, is a type of cyst that forms in the median raphe, a vertical line that runs along the length of the penis.

**Answer**: A. Aspirate the bullae with a sterile needle and cover with a clean dressing

The correct answer is A because the patient's presentation of spontaneous blistering on the right lower extremity is consistent with diabetic dermopathy, a condition that occurs in patients with diabetes and is characterized by skin changes such as hyperpigmentation, macules, and bullae. The blisters in this case are likely to be filled with serous fluid and may be fragile, making it important to handle them gently to avoid further trauma or infection.

Aspirating the bullae with a sterile needle and covering them with a clean dressing is a reasonable first step in management. This approach allows for drainage of any fluid that may be present and helps to prevent further leakage or infection. Additionally, it may provide some symptomatic relief for the patient.

In contrast, performing a skin biopsy (choice B) may be appropriate for diagnostic purposes, but it is not the most urgent step in management. The patient's history and physical examination findings are already consistent with diabetic dermopathy, and a biopsy may not provide any new information that would change management.

Finally, starting oral prednisone (choice C) or treating with oral cephalexin for 7 days (choice D) may not be appropriate at this time. Prednisone may be considered for severe cases of diabetic dermopathy that are unresponsive to other treatments, but it is not a first-line therapy. Cephalexin is an antibiotic that may be used to treat any secondary bacterial infections, but it is not indicated for the management of diabetic dermopathy itself.

Therefore, the best answer is A, aspirating the bullae with a sterile needle and covering them with a clean dressing.

**Answer**: B. Commence high-dose corticosteroids

The patient's symptoms of sudden painless vision loss in one eye, along with ear pain, nasal congestion, and night sweats, suggest a possible diagnosis of giant cell arteritis (GCA). GCA is a vasculitis that affects the medium and large arteries, including the ophthalmic artery, which can cause vision loss. The patient's elevated C-reactive protein and leukocytosis also support this diagnosis.

Commencing high-dose corticosteroids (choice B) is the appropriate next step in managing this patient's condition. Corticosteroids are effective in reducing inflammation and preventing further vision loss in patients with GCA. The recommended dose is typically 40-60 mg of prednisone per day, given for 1-2 months, followed by a gradual taper.

Requesting a magnetic resonance image of orbits and sinuses (choice A) may be appropriate later in the patient's management, but it is not the most urgent step. While MRI can help evaluate the extent of inflammation in the orbit and sinuses, it may not be able to diagnose GCA definitively.

Commencing broad-spectrum antibiotics (choice C) is not appropriate at this time, as there is no evidence of an active infection.

Requesting an urgent stroke consult (choice D) is also not appropriate, as the patient's symptoms do not suggest a stroke.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Commence high-dose corticosteroids.

**Answer**:C. Start corticosteroids

The patient's symptoms and imaging findings are consistent with acute-onset orbital inflammation, which can be caused by various conditions, including infection, autoimmune disorders, and inflammatory diseases. The patient's history of multiple myeloma and recent initiation of daratumumab and zoledronic acid increases the likelihood of an inflammatory or autoimmune-related cause.

Option A, starting antifungal therapy, may be appropriate if the patient had evidence of invasive fungal sinusitis, but the absence of afferent pupillary defect and the lack of osseous structure destruction on CT scan suggest that this is less likely. Additionally, the patient's symptoms worsened despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage, which further supports the need for a different approach.

Option B, sinus biopsies, may be necessary to establish a definitive diagnosis, but it is not the most appropriate next step given the patient's rapidly worsening symptoms and the concern for potential complications from the procedure.

Option D, orbital biopsy, may also be necessary to establish a definitive diagnosis, but it is also not the most appropriate next step given the patient's symptoms and the concern for potential complications from the procedure.

Option C, starting corticosteroids, is the most appropriate next step. Corticosteroids can help reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms in conditions such as orbital inflammation, and they can be started while awaiting the results of further diagnostic tests. In this case, the patient's worsening symptoms despite broad-spectrum antibiotic coverage suggest that corticosteroids may be beneficial in reducing inflammation and preventing further damage. Additionally, corticosteroids may also help to reduce the risk of vision loss, which is a potential complication of orbital inflammation.

The correct answer is D. Perform hemoglobin electrophoresis.

The patient's symptoms of acute chest pain and respiratory insufficiency suggest a possible pulmonary embolism. The patient's history of recent surgery and immobility increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Additionally, the patient's low hemoglobin level and hematocrit suggest anemia, which could be a result of bleeding from a pulmonary embolism.

Performing hemoglobin electrophoresis will help to identify any abnormalities in the patient's red blood cells, such as sickle cell disease or thalassemia, which could affect the patient's response to treatment. This test can also help to diagnose other conditions that may cause anemia, such as hemolytic anemia or iron deficiency anemia.

The other options are not directly related to the patient's current symptoms and medical history.

A. Obtain blood cultures, perform vitreous tap, and inject antibiotics: While blood cultures may be necessary to rule out endocarditis or sepsis, there is no indication for a vitreous tap or injection of antibiotics at this time. The patient's symptoms do not suggest an infectious cause, and the risk of complications from a vitreous tap outweighs the potential benefits.

B. Perform laser iridotomy: This option is not relevant to the patient's current symptoms or medical history. Laser iridotomy is a procedure used to treat angle-closure glaucoma, but it is not indicated in this case.

C. Observation: While close observation is important in any patient with acute chest pain, it is not the most appropriate initial step in this case. The patient's symptoms and medical history suggest a high likelihood of pulmonary embolism, and further diagnostic testing is necessary to confirm or rule out this diagnosis.

Therefore, the best answer is D. Perform hemoglobin electrophoresis.

**Answer**: B. Inflammation of actinic keratoses

The patient's symptoms of pruritic, erythematous, scaly macules and papules on her forearms, face, chest, and upper back, with sparing of the palms and soles, are consistent with a diagnosis of actinic keratoses. Actinic keratoses are rough, scaly patches on the skin that can develop into squamous cell carcinoma, a type of skin cancer. The patient's history of substantial sun exposure increases her risk of developing actinic keratoses.

The other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms:

A. Cutaneous deposits of metastatic breast cancer: While the patient does have metastatic breast cancer, the symptoms described do not suggest cutaneous deposits of the cancer. Cutaneous deposits typically appear as firm, painless nodules or plaques on the skin, and are not typically pruritic or scaly.

C. Medication hypersensitivity reaction: The patient has recently started treatment with capecitabine, which could potentially cause a hypersensitivity reaction. However, the patient's symptoms do not suggest a typical hypersensitivity reaction, which would more likely manifest as a widespread rash, fever, and internal organ involvement.

D. Discoid lupus erythematosus: Discoid lupus erythematosus is a chronic autoimmune disease that can cause skin lesions. However, the patient's symptoms do not suggest the characteristic discoid lesions, which are typically flat, round, and scaly, and may have a follicular plug. Additionally, discoid lupus erythematosus typically affects the face, ears, and scalp, rather than the forearms, chest, and upper back.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, the most likely diagnosis is inflammation of actinic keratoses.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain why C. Schwannoma is the correct answer and why the other choices are incorrect.

**Answer**: C. Schwannoma

A. Chondroma:
Chondroma is a benign tumor that arises from cartilage cells. While it can occur in various parts of the body, it is not typically found in the trachea. The patient's symptoms of intermittent stridor and the location of the mass in the cervical trachea make it less likely that the tumor is a chondroma. Additionally, the appearance of the mass on the flexible videostroboscopy and the chest radiography does not suggest a cartilaginous tumor. Therefore, option A is incorrect.

B. Glomus tumor:
Glomus tumors are rare, benign tumors that originate from the glomus cells that line the trachea and bronchi. They are typically located in the larynx or trachea and can cause symptoms similar to those described in the patient's history, such as stridor and difficulty breathing. However, the location of the mass in the cervical trachea and its pedunculated nature do not fit the typical presentation of a glomus tumor. Moreover, the absence of a glomus tumor on the chest radiography also makes this diagnosis less likely. Therefore, option B is incorrect.

D. Granular cell tumor:
Granular cell tumors are rare, benign tumors that can occur in various parts of the body, including the trachea. They are characterized by a distinctive histopathological appearance, with a mixture of small, uniform cells and larger, granular cells. While they can cause symptoms similar to those described in the patient's history, such as stridor and difficulty breathing, the location of the mass in the cervical trachea and its pedunculated nature do not fit the typical presentation of a granular cell tumor.

**Answer**:A. Gorham-Stout disease

The correct diagnosis is A. Gorham-Stout disease, a rare condition characterized by the proliferation of lymphatic vessels in the bone, leading to bone destruction and replacement with lymphatic tissue. This diagnosis is supported by the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.

The patient's symptoms of unilateral hearing loss and middle ear effusion are consistent with Gorham-Stout disease, which can cause conductive hearing loss due to the destruction of the middle ear bones. The presence of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak, confirmed by β-2-transferrine analysis, is also consistent with Gorham-Stout disease, as it can cause communication between the cerebrospinal fluid and the middle ear.

The imaging findings also support the diagnosis of Gorham-Stout disease. The high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan showed a lytic aspect of the right temporal bone extending to the petrous apex and the petrous bone, sparing the otic capsule. This is consistent with the bone destruction and replacement with lymphatic tissue that is characteristic of Gorham-Stout disease. The soft tissue opacification of the right mastoid air cells and the hyperintense T2 signal in the petrous apex and mastoid air cells on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are also consistent with Gorham-Stout disease, as it can cause proliferation of lymphatic vessels in the bone.

The other answer choices are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.

B. Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disorder characterized by the proliferation of Langerhans cells, which are a type of immune cell. While it can cause bone destruction and hearing loss, it typically affects the temporal bone and mastoid air cells more symmetrically than what is described in this case. Additionally, the presence of a CSF leak and the imaging findings of a lytic aspect of the temporal bone are not typical of Langerhans cell histiocytosis.

**Answer**: B. Hydroxyurea-induced squamous dysplasia

The correct answer is B, Hydroxyurea-induced squamous dysplasia, because the patient's history of long-term hydroxyurea therapy and the clinical findings of numerous, primarily photodistributed, crusted, and ulcerated plaques on the trunk and extremities are consistent with this diagnosis.

Hydroxyurea is a chemotherapy drug that is commonly used to treat essential thrombocytosis, as it can reduce the production of platelets and prevent the risk of bleeding. However, long-term use of hydroxyurea can lead to skin side effects, including squamous dysplasia, which is a precancerous condition characterized by abnormal changes in the squamous cells of the skin.

Squamous dysplasia can manifest as rough, scaly, or crusted plaques on sun-exposed areas of the skin, which is consistent with the patient's clinical findings. The patient's history of nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSCa) and the presence of ulcerations also support this diagnosis, as squamous dysplasia can progress to squamous cell carcinoma, a type of skin cancer.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Hydroxyurea-induced ulcerations: While hydroxyurea can cause skin ulcerations, the patient's history of long-term use and the presence of numerous, photodistributed plaques suggest a more chronic condition, such as squamous dysplasia.

C. Hydroxyurea-induced phototoxic eruption: Phototoxic eruptions are acute reactions to sun exposure and are not typically associated with long-term use of hydroxyurea. The patient's clinical findings, including the presence of crusted and ulcerated plaques, do not support this diagnosis.

D. Iatrogenic epidermodysplasia verruciformis: This is a rare condition that is caused by chronic use of certain medications, including hydroxyurea.

**Answer**: D. Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis

The patient's history of multiple painless scalp nodules and subcutaneous masses, along with the absence of tenderness or swelling, suggests a benign tumor. The patient's age and the fact that the tumors have been present since childhood also support this diagnosis.

Infantile myofibromatosis (choice A) is a rare condition characterized by multiple benign tumors that usually appear in the first year of life. It is unlikely that the patient would have had these tumors for 40 years without any symptoms or complications.

Mafucci syndrome (choice B) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by multiple non-cancerous tumors, usually found in the skin and subcutaneous tissue. However, Mafucci syndrome typically presents with a combination of cutaneous and osseous lesions, and the patient's lack of other skin manifestations and family history makes this diagnosis less likely.

Lipoid proteinosis (choice C) is a rare condition characterized by the accumulation of lipid-rich material in the skin and subcutaneous tissue. However, the patient's history of multiple hard nodules and the absence of any skin lesions do not support this diagnosis.

Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis (choice D) is a rare benign tumor that typically presents in children and young adults. It is characterized by the accumulation of hyaline material in the skin and subcutaneous tissue, leading to the formation of multiple hard nodules. The patient's history and physical examination findings are consistent with this diagnosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis.

**Answer**: C. Start intravenous magnesium

The patient in this case has a history of recurrent torsade de pointes (TdP), a potentially life-threatening arrhythmia. The patient's current medication, metoprolol succinate, may be contributing to the TdP, as it can prolong the QT interval and increase the risk of TdP, especially in patients with a history of heart disease. Therefore, discontinuing metoprolol (Option A) may be appropriate. However, sotalol is not the best choice for this patient, as it also has a risk of QT prolongation and TdP.

Intravenous amiodarone (Option B) is a reasonable choice for the management of TdP, as it has been shown to be effective in converting TdP to a normal sinus rhythm. However, in this case, the patient's potassium level is already low (4.4 mEq/L), and amiodarone can further lower potassium levels, which may worsen the arrhythmia.

Emergent implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implant (Option D) may be considered for patients with recurrent TdP who have a high risk of sudden cardiac death. However, in this case, the patient has not had any previous episodes of cardiac arrest or syncope, and the arrhythmia has been successfully converted with medication. Therefore, an ICD implant may not be the most appropriate choice at this time.

Intravenous magnesium (Option C) is a safe and effective treatment for TdP, and it is often used as a first-line therapy. Magnesium can help to convert TdP to a normal sinus rhythm by shortening the QT interval and reducing the risk of further arrhythmia. In this case, the patient's low magnesium level (1.7 mg/dL) may be contributing to the TdP, and administering intravenous magnesium may help to resolve the arrhythmia.

Therefore, the best answer is C. Start intravenous magnesium.

**Answer**: D. 100% Oxygen, intravenous fluid, and Trendelenburg position

Explanation:

The patient's sudden onset of dyspnea and retrosternal chest pain during the balloon mitral valvotomy procedure suggests that she may be experiencing a pulmonary embolism or other cardiovascular emergency. It is important to address this emergency promptly to prevent further complications.

Option A, pericardiocentesis, is not the appropriate next step in this situation. Pericardiocentesis is a procedure that involves inserting a needle into the pericardial space to drain fluid or blood that has accumulated there. While this procedure may be necessary in some cases, it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient's current symptoms.

Option B, intravenous thrombolysis, may be considered as a potential treatment option for a pulmonary embolism, but it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient. Thrombolysis involves using medication to dissolve blood clots, and it is typically used in patients who have a confirmed diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. However, in this case, the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a typical pulmonary embolism, and there is no confirmation of the diagnosis. Additionally, thrombolysis can cause bleeding complications, which could be dangerous for the patient.

Option C, catheter-directed thromboembolectomy, is also not the most appropriate choice for this patient. This procedure involves using a catheter to remove blood clots from the lung, but it is typically used in patients who have a confirmed diagnosis of pulmonary embolism and are experiencing severe symptoms. As mentioned earlier, the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a typical pulmonary embolism, and there is no confirmation of the diagnosis.

Option D, 100% oxygen, intravenous fluid, and Trendelenburg position, is the most appropriate next step for this patient. The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and chest pain suggest that she may be experiencing a cardiovascular emergency, and it is important to provide her with oxygen ther

**Answer**:C. Obtain aqueous fluid for fungal polymerase chain reaction

The patient's symptoms and clinical findings, such as persistent low-grade anterior uveitis, hyperpigmented corneal lesions, and elevated intraocular pressure, suggest the possibility of a fungal infection. Fungal infections can cause corneal lesions and can be difficult to diagnose based solely on clinical findings. Therefore, it is appropriate to obtain aqueous fluid for fungal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to confirm the diagnosis.

Increasing the frequency of topical corticosteroids (choice A) may help to reduce inflammation, but it will not diagnose or treat a potential fungal infection.

Referring the patient to an ocular oncologist (choice B) may be appropriate if the lesions are suspected to be melanoma, but there is no indication of melanoma in the patient's history or clinical findings.

Obtaining a vitreous biopsy for bacterial culture (choice D) may be necessary if there is a suspicion of bacterial endophthalmitis, but there is no indication of bacterial infection in the patient's symptoms or clinical findings.

Therefore, the best answer is C. Obtain aqueous fluid for fungal polymerase chain reaction.

**Answer**:C. Angiosarcoma

The patient's history of radiation therapy and chronic graft vs host disease (GVHD) following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) suggests that the recurrent hemorrhagic and friable nodules on his hips and forearms are likely due to radiation-induced angiosarcoma. Angiosarcoma is a rare and aggressive type of cancer that arises from the endothelial cells lining blood vessels. Radiation therapy is a known risk factor for the development of angiosarcoma, particularly in patients who have received high doses of radiation, as in this patient's case. The patient's history of chronic GVHD, which is a known complication of HSCT, may also contribute to the development of angiosarcoma.

The patient's symptoms, including recurrent hemorrhagic and friable nodules on the bilateral hips and forearms, are consistent with angiosarcoma. The nodules are likely the result of abnormal blood vessel growth and fragility, which is a hallmark of angiosarcoma. The patient's previous treatment with debulking procedures and excision biopsies, as well as the lack of evidence of visceral or extracutaneous disease on positron emission tomography (PET) computed tomography (CT), also support the diagnosis of angiosarcoma.

In contrast, the other answer choices do not fit the patient's symptoms and medical history. Atypical infection (choice A) is unlikely given the patient's history of radiation therapy and chronic GVHD, as well as the lack of evidence of infection on PET CT. Opportunistic fungal infection (choice B) is also unlikely, as the patient's symptoms do not suggest a fungal infection, and the patient has been treated with antifungal medications without improvement. Granulation tissue (choice D) is a possible diagnosis, but it does not explain the recurrent hemorrhagic and friable nodules on the bilateral hips and forearms, and the patient's history of radiation therapy and chronic GVHD suggests a more aggressive diagnosis.

**Answer**:C. IgG4-related disease

The correct diagnosis is C. IgG4-related disease. The patient's symptoms of orbital swelling, eye pain, blurry vision, and bilateral photophobia, as well as the physical examination findings of chemosis, injected conjunctiva, and periorbital edema, are consistent with IgG4-related disease. The patient's family history, with a brother and father who both had chronic orbital swelling, also supports this diagnosis.

The patient's imaging studies, including computed tomography with contrast and magnetic resonance imaging with contrast, showed bilateral ethmoid and frontal sinus opacification and right worse than left orbital fat stranding, which is consistent with IgG4-related disease. The patient's elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, total IgG, and IgG4 levels also support this diagnosis.

The patient's orbital biopsy showed nodular lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates separated by thick collagen bundles, without evidence of fungal infection or necrosis, which is consistent with IgG4-related disease. The patient's negative tests for thyroid-stimulating hormone, angiotensin-converting enzyme, lysozyme, antinuclear antibody, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) also support this diagnosis, as IgG4-related disease is often associated with negative autoimmune serology.

The other answer choices are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and test results.

A. Graves disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes hyperthyroidism and is often associated with orbitopathy. However, the patient's negative thyroid-stimulating hormone and antithyroid antibody tests make this diagnosis less likely.

B. Invasive fungal sinusitis with orbital extension is a serious infection that can cause orbital swelling and pain. However, the patient's imaging studies did not show any evidence of fungal infection, and the patient's cultures grew methicillin

**Answer**: B. Immunotherapy-related inflammation

The patient's symptoms of redness, swelling, and discharge from the tumor site are consistent with immunotherapy-related inflammation. The patient had recently started neoadjuvant immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy, which can cause an inflammatory response in the body, leading to symptoms such as these. The fact that the patient did not have a fever and that laboratory results showed no leukocytosis (an increase in white blood cell count, which can indicate infection) suggest that the inflammation was not caused by an infection.

**A**. Infection and suppuration: While the patient did have discharge from the tumor site, the lack of fever and the absence of leukocytosis suggest that this was not caused by an infection. Additionally, the patient's symptoms began after starting immunotherapy, which is not typically associated with infection.

**C**. Tumor progression: The patient's symptoms began after starting immunotherapy, which is not typically associated with tumor progression. Additionally, the patient's tumor was resected without intraoperative or postoperative complications, suggesting that the tumor had not progressed significantly.

**D**. Allergic reaction: The patient's symptoms do not suggest an allergic reaction. There is no mention of hives, itching, or difficulty breathing, which are common symptoms of an allergic reaction. Additionally, the patient did not have a fever, which is often present in allergic reactions.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B**. Immunotherapy-related inflammation.

**Answer**:B. Hemosiderotic fibrolipomatous tumor

The correct answer is B. Hemosiderotic fibrolipomatous tumor because it is a benign soft tissue tumor that can present with a plaque-like lesion, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms and examination findings. The patient's history of a twisting injury to the affected hand two years prior suggests a possible traumatic etiology for the tumor, which is also consistent with the diagnosis of a hemosiderotic fibrolipomatous tumor.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Pigmented epithelioid melanocytoma: This is a rare type of melanocytic tumor that typically presents as a pigmented lesion on sun-exposed skin. It is unlikely to present as a plaque-like lesion on the dorsum of the hand, and the patient's history of a twisting injury would not be consistent with this diagnosis.

C. Pigmented dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (Bednar tumor): This is a rare type of sarcoma that typically presents as a rapidly growing, painless nodule on the trunk or extremities. While it can have a plaque-like appearance, the patient's history of a twisting injury and the absence of any family history of sarcoma or bleeding disorders make this diagnosis less likely.

D. Angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma: This is a rare type of soft tissue tumor that typically presents as a slowly growing, painless mass on the trunk or extremities. While it can have a plaque-like appearance, the patient's history of a twisting injury and the absence of any family history of sarcoma or bleeding disorders make this diagnosis less likely.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, examination findings, and medical history, the most likely diagnosis is B. Hemosiderotic fibrolipomatous tumor.

**Answer**: C. Eosinophilic, polymorphic, and pruritic eruption associated with radiotherapy (EPPER)

The correct answer is C, Eosinophilic, polymorphic, and pruritic eruption associated with radiotherapy (EPPER), because the patient's symptoms and clinical findings are consistent with this diagnosis.

EPPER is a rare side effect of radiotherapy that typically occurs within 2-6 weeks after the start of treatment. It is characterized by a pruritic, polymorphic eruption that can affect various parts of the body, including the skin, scalp, and mucous membranes. The eruption is often accompanied by eosinophilia, which is an increase in the number of eosinophils in the blood.

In this case, the patient developed a pruritic rash on her legs 13 days after the start of radiotherapy, which subsequently spread to other parts of her body. The rash had a polymorphic appearance, with erythematous edematous coalescing papules and plaques, as well as annular and polycyclic configurations with central hyperpigmentation. The patient also had eosinophilia, with an absolute eosinophil count of 0.80 ×103/uL.

The punch biopsy results showed a moderately dense perivascular and interstitial infiltrate of mononuclear cells with innumerable eosinophils, which is consistent with EPPER.

The other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and clinical findings.

A, Radiation-induced bullous pemphigoid, is a rare side effect of radiotherapy that occurs within 2-6 weeks after the start of treatment. It is characterized by the development of large, tense blisters on the skin, which can be painful and pruritic. However, the patient's rash did not have the characteristic blistering appearance of bullous pemphigoid.

**Answer**:B. Cardiac positron emission tomography

Explanation:
The patient presented with a wide complex tachycardia, which was resistant to amiodarone and required synchronized cardioversion. The patient had a history of nonspecific T-wave abnormalities on electrocardiogram (ECG). The patient's cardiac catheterization revealed patent coronary arteries. The patient's cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a dilated right ventricle with moderately reduced systolic function and transmural late gadolinium enhancement with akinesis and dyskinesis involving the right ventricular (RV) free wall and outflow tract extending to the left ventricular (LV) anterior, septal, and apical segments. Given the patient's history of T-wave abnormalities and the findings on cardiac MRI, it is likely that the patient has a cardiac condition that may benefit from further imaging with cardiac positron emission tomography (PET).

Cardiac PET is a non-invasive imaging modality that provides information on myocardial perfusion, metabolism, and function. It can help identify areas of myocardial ischemia, scar, and inflammation, which can aid in the diagnosis and management of various cardiac conditions, such as coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, and cardiomyopathy. In this case, cardiac PET may help identify the underlying cause of the patient's T-wave abnormalities and help guide management decisions.

Discharge home after implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) (choice A) may not be appropriate at this time, as the patient's arrhythmia was not successfully terminated with medication and required synchronized cardioversion. Additionally, the patient's history of T-wave abnormalities and the findings on cardiac MRI suggest that there may be an underlying cardiac condition that needs to be further evaluated.

Transthoracic echocardiogram (choice C) may not provide the same level of detail as cardiac PET and may not be able to assess myocardial perfusion and met

**Answer**:D. Synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis syndrome

The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis syndrome (SAPHO). SAPHO is a rare autoimmune disease that affects the skin and bones. The patient's neck pain, stiffness, and electric shock-like numbness are consistent with the musculoskeletal symptoms of SAPHO. The presence of pustules on the palms and back of both hands is also consistent with the skin manifestations of SAPHO. The patient's age and lack of history of tobacco, alcohol, or drug misuse also fit with the typical demographic of SAPHO patients.

The other choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and examination findings. Neurosyphilis (choice A) is a sexually transmitted infection that can cause a variety of neurological symptoms, but it is unlikely in this case given the patient's age and lack of risk factors. Metastatic tumor (choice B) is a possibility, but it would be unusual for a metastatic tumor to cause the specific symptoms and examination findings described in the case. Rickettsial infection (choice C) is a possibility, but it is unlikely given the patient's lack of exposure to ticks or other vectors and the negative results of workup for rheumatic and infectious disease.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis syndrome.

**Answer**: A. Obtain serologic test results for Treponema pallidum

The correct answer is A, Obtain serologic test results for Treponema pallidum, because the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a possible diagnosis of syphilis, which is caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. The irregular gray-white ulcers with a surrounding erythema on the soft palate, uvula, and tonsils, as well as the nontender bilateral submandibular lymphadenopathy, are characteristic of syphilitic ulcers. Additionally, the patient's report of sexual contact with one male partner over the past 6 months increases the likelihood of a sexually transmitted infection.

Therefore, it is important to confirm the diagnosis of syphilis by obtaining serologic test results for Treponema pallidum. This will help to guide further management and treatment of the patient's condition.

**Answer**: B. Perform a biopsy of the gray-white plaque

While a biopsy of the gray-white plaque may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of syphilis, it is not the most appropriate next step in management. Biopsy results may take several days to return, and treatment should not be delayed. Obtaining serologic test results for Treponema pallidum is a faster and more appropriate way to confirm the diagnosis.

**Answer**: C. Prescribe oral amoxicillin

Oral amoxicillin is not the most appropriate treatment for syphilis. While amoxicillin is effective against many bacterial infections, it is not effective against Treponema pallidum, the bacterium that causes syphilis. The treatment of choice for syphilis is typically penicillin G benzathine, which is administered intramuscularly.

**Answer**:C. Positron emission tomography scan

The patient's symptoms and examination findings, including intermittent dull pain, keratoconus, corneal scarring, Descemet folds, mixed cataract, amelanotic area of choroidal thickening, subretinal fluid, and hyperpigmentation, suggest a choroidal lesion. The presence of hyperautofluorescence in a leopard-spotting pattern on fundus autofluorescence and hypocyanescent lesions on indocyanine green angiography further support this diagnosis.

The next step in management would be to determine the nature of the choroidal lesion, which can be achieved with a positron emission tomography (PET) scan. A PET scan can help differentiate between a benign and malignant choroidal lesion by assessing the metabolic activity of the lesion. This information is crucial in determining the appropriate treatment and management plan for the patient.

Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (Option A) may not be the best choice at this stage, as it may not provide a definitive diagnosis and may carry a risk of bleeding, infection, and damage to the surrounding tissue.

Rituximab and radiotherapy (Option B) are treatments for malignant choroidal lesions, but they may not be appropriate at this stage, as the diagnosis has not been confirmed.

Plaque brachytherapy (Option D) is a treatment for choroidal melanoma, but it is not appropriate for a patient with a suspected amelanotic choroidal lesion.

Therefore, the best answer is C. Positron emission tomography scan.

**Answer**: D. Observe with no additional testing or intervention

Explanation:
The patient in the scenario has a history of breast and kidney carcinomas, and an asymptomatic, amelanotic choroidal mass in her left eye that is suspicious for metastatic disease. The mass is primarily located in the sclera and pushes and thins the overlying choroid, as shown by optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging.

Option A, performing fine-needle aspiration biopsy with cytology and cytogenetics, may seem like an appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis of metastatic disease. However, the patient's history of breast and kidney carcinomas increases the likelihood that the choroidal mass is a metastasis. Given the small size of the mass and its location primarily in the sclera, the risk of bleeding or other complications from a biopsy may outweigh the potential benefits of a definitive diagnosis.

Option B, performing iodine 125 plaque radiotherapy, is not appropriate at this time. While plaque radiotherapy is a common treatment for choroidal metastases, it is typically reserved for larger, symptomatic lesions that are causing vision loss or are at risk of growing and causing further damage. The patient's asymptomatic, small lesion does not meet these criteria, and radiotherapy would not be the next appropriate step.

Option C, initiating intravitreal methotrexate, is also not appropriate. Intravitreal methotrexate is a chemotherapy agent used to treat uveal melanoma and other intraocular tumors. While it has been used in some cases of choroidal metastases, it is not a standard treatment for this condition, and its use in this scenario would be off-label and potentially risky.

Therefore, the best option, D. Observe with no additional testing or intervention, is the most appropriate next step. The patient's small, asymptomatic lesion does not require immediate treatment, and close observation with regular follow-up appointments is the best course of action to monitor for any changes or potential growth of the lesion.

**Answer**: C. Inflammatory breast cancer

The correct answer is C. Inflammatory breast cancer because it best fits the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

A. Cutaneous angiosarcoma does not fit the patient's symptoms as it is a malignant tumor that arises from the skin's blood vessels and typically presents with a painless, slowly growing nodule or plaque on the skin. The patient's rash and swelling on the chest wall do not match this description.

B. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis from COVID-19 vaccine is an unlikely diagnosis as the patient's symptoms began 6 weeks after receiving the second dose of the Moderna vaccine, which is an mRNA vaccine and not a live virus vaccine. Additionally, the patient's symptoms of a rapidly progressing rash and swelling of the left side of the chest wall do not match the typical symptoms of leukocytoclastic vasculitis, which is characterized by the presence of palpable purpura, bruising, and ulcerations.

D. Primary adnexal gland carcinoma is not a likely diagnosis as it is a rare type of cancer that typically affects the apocrine glands of the axilla, and the patient's symptoms do not suggest this diagnosis. The patient's history of gynecomastia and inverted left nipple suggest a different diagnosis.

Inflammatory breast cancer, on the other hand, is a type of breast cancer that presents with symptoms similar to the patient's, such as a rapidly progressing rash, swelling, and redness of the breast. The patient's history of gynecomastia and inverted left nipple are also consistent with this diagnosis. The laboratory results, including the punch biopsy of the skin and core biopsy of the lymph node, support this diagnosis as they show a diffuse island of atypical cells in the dermis and multiple FDG-avid nodes in the axilla, left internal mammary, and left cervical chain.

**Answer**: A. Madelung disease

Madelung disease, also known as benign symmetric lipomatosis, is a rare condition characterized by the growth of multiple symmetric lipomas, which are non-cancerous fatty tumors. The condition typically affects the neck, shoulders, and upper back, and can cause symptoms such as difficulty swallowing, breathing, and speaking.

In this case, the patient presented with a large bilateral compressible neck mass that had been growing over the past two years, causing solid food dysphagia and difficulty breathing at night. The patient had a similar mass that was treated with liposuction 10 years prior, which suggests a history of Madelung disease. The patient's family history was negative for any head and neck benign or malignant disease, which makes it less likely that the patient has a familial lipomatosis. The patient's social history was also negative for tobacco or alcohol use, which reduces the likelihood of drug-induced lipomatosis.

The patient's symptoms, medical history, and imaging results, including the diffuse symmetric fatty infiltration of the pharynx, larynx, trachea, and esophagus, and the extensive areas of fat deposition within the neck, are consistent with Madelung disease. The surgical intervention and postsurgical magnetic resonance imaging scan also support this diagnosis.

In contrast, liposarcoma, which is a type of cancer that develops in fat cells, is less likely given the patient's history of a similar mass that was treated with liposuction 10 years prior, the lack of family history of lipomatosis, and the absence of any neurological deficits. Familial lipomatosis, which is a rare inherited condition characterized by multiple lipomas, is also less likely given the patient's negative family history. Drug-induced lipomatosis, which is a rare side effect of certain medications, is unlikely given the patient's social history.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, medical history, and imaging results, Madelung disease is the most likely diagnosis.

The correct answer is C, Porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus, because it best matches the clinical and histopathological features described in the case.

A. Inflammatory linear verrucous epidermal nevus is an incorrect choice because although it can present with linear arrangement of lesions, the histopathology does not match the features described in the case. Inflammatory linear verrucous epidermal nevus typically shows a dense infiltrate of lymphocytes, histiocytes, and neutrophils in the dermis, which is not seen in the skin biopsy specimen provided.

B. Trichodysplasia spinulosa is an incorrect choice because although it can present with small, filiform spicules, the distribution and arrangement of the lesions do not match the case. Trichodysplasia spinulosa typically presents with small, rough, brown or yellowish papules on the face, particularly on the cheeks, nose, and forehead, in a scattered or grouped distribution, rather than the linear arrangement described in the case.

D. Multiple minute digitate hyperkeratosis is an incorrect choice because although it can present with small, digitate projections, the histopathology does not match the features described in the case. Multiple minute digitate hyperkeratosis typically shows a compact orthokeratotic stratum corneum with small, digitate projections, whereas the skin biopsy specimen provided shows hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and parakeratotic columns overlying the dilated epidermal invaginations, which is consistent with Porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus.

**Answer**:C. Langerhans cell histiocytosis

The patient's symptoms, such as nonhealing ulcers in the groin and axillae, scalp scaling, and greasiness, polyuria, and polydipsia, are consistent with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). LCH is a rare multisystem disorder that can affect various organs, including the skin, lungs, liver, and lymph nodes. The patient's history of nonhealing ulcers and the presence of yellowish greasy scales on the scalp are both consistent with LCH. The patient's systemic symptoms, such as polyuria and polydipsia, are also consistent with LCH, as it can cause endocrinopathies.

The patient's skin lesions, described as deep ulcers resembling knife-cut ulcers, are also consistent with LCH. LCH can cause skin lesions, including papules, plaques, and ulcers, which may be painful and can have a characteristic "saw-tooth" border. The presence of yellowish pus discharge from the ulcers is also consistent with LCH, as it can cause chronic inflammation and infection.

The histopathological examination of the skin biopsy showed dense infiltration of the ulcer bed by atypical cells with characteristic grooved vesicular nuclei and moderate amphophilic cytoplasm, which is consistent with LCH. Immunohistochemistry showed diffuse positivity for CD1a in the lower epidermis and dermis, which is also consistent with LCH, as CD1a is a marker for Langerhans cells.

Behcet disease (choice A) is a systemic vasculitis that can cause skin lesions, including ulcers, but it typically affects the mouth and genitalia. Metastatic Crohn disease (choice B) can cause skin lesions, including ulcers, but it typically affects the gastrointestinal tract and lymph nodes.

The patient's symptoms of recurrent presyncope and bradycardia, along with the finding of a persistent RBBB and LPFB on ECG, suggest a condition that may benefit from pacemaker implantation. A pacemaker can help regulate the patient's heart rhythm and prevent symptomatic bradycardia.

Ambulatory ECG monitoring (choice A) may be useful in certain cases, but it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient. While it may provide additional information about the patient's heart rhythm, it is unlikely to change management in this case, as the diagnosis of RBBB and LPFB is already established, and the patient's symptoms are consistent with a pacemaker indication.

Exercise treadmill test (choice C) is not indicated in this case, as the patient's symptoms are not related to exercise, and the test would not provide additional information that would change management.

Electrophysiology study (choice D) is a more invasive test that is typically used to evaluate the electrical activity of the heart in patients with arrhythmias. While it may be considered in some cases, it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient, as the diagnosis of RBBB and LPFB is already established, and a pacemaker is likely to be beneficial.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Pacemaker implantation.

**Answer**: D. Sporadic late-onset nemaline rod myopathy

The patient's symptoms of progressive camptocormia, head drop, and dysphagia, along with the physical examination findings of significant wasting of proximal and paraspinal muscles, symmetric weakness of neck flexion, shoulder abduction, elbow flexion and extension, and hip flexion and extension bilaterally, and weakness of left shoulder elevation and winging of the left scapula, are consistent with a diagnosis of nemaline rod myopathy.

Nemaline rod myopathy is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness, wasting, and stiffness, with a characteristic "nemaline" or "rod-like" appearance of muscle fibers on biopsy. The patient's age of onset and the presence of a small IgG κ paraprotein on serum electrophoresis and immunofixation also support this diagnosis.

The other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and findings.

A. Late-onset Pompe disease (glycogen-storage disease type 2): This is a rare genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase, which leads to accumulation of glycogen in muscle and other tissues. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are not consistent with Pompe disease, which typically presents with proximal muscle weakness, respiratory problems, and cardiomyopathy.

B. Myasthenia gravis: This is an autoimmune disorder characterized by muscle weakness and fatigue, which worsens with activity and improves with rest. The patient's symptoms of progressive camptocormia and dysphagia are not typical of myasthenia gravis, which typically affects the extraocular muscles, face, and limbs.

C. Paraneoplastic myositis: This is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation of the muscles, which can be associated with cancer

**Answer**:B. Initiate continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy

The correct answer is B, Initiate continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy, for the following reasons:

A. Advise use of a wedge pillow to avoid sleeping in the supine position: While using a wedge pillow may help alleviate symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) by allowing the patient to sleep in a non-supine position, it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient has already undergone a home sleep apnea test, and the results indicate severe OSA. Given the severity of the patient's OSA and her comorbidities (hypertension and epilepsy), it is more appropriate to initiate CPAP therapy rather than recommending a wedge pillow.

C. Perform laboratory-based polysomnography: While laboratory-based polysomnography (PSG) is the gold standard for diagnosing OSA, it is not necessary in this case since the patient has already undergone a home sleep apnea test. The home sleep test results indicate severe OSA, and it is appropriate to initiate CPAP therapy without further testing.

D. Repeat the home sleep apnea test: Repeating the home sleep apnea test may be unnecessary and may not provide additional valuable information. The patient's symptoms and comorbidities, along with the severity of the OSA indicated by the home sleep test results, suggest that initiating CPAP therapy is the most appropriate next step.

Therefore, the correct answer is B, Initiate continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy.

**Answer**:B. Perform systemic workup, including chest imaging

The patient's symptoms of severe physical exhaustion, syncopal episodes, dysphagia, and sinus congestion, along with the physical examination findings of diffuse facial edema and erythema without proptosis, suggest a systemic condition that may be contributing to the elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in the left eye.

Choice A, discontinuing fluorometholone eye drops, may help to reduce the risk of further IOP elevation, but it does not address the underlying systemic condition that may be causing the elevated IOP.

Choice C, adding netarsudil eye drops every night at bedtime in the left eye, may help to reduce IOP in the short term, but it does not address the underlying systemic condition, and the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a more urgent need for systemic evaluation.

Choice D, placing a second nonvalved tube in the left eye with adjuvant micropulse laser, may be a consideration for managing the patient's glaucoma, but it is not the most appropriate next step given the patient's systemic symptoms and examination findings.

Therefore, the correct answer is B, Perform systemic workup, including chest imaging, to evaluate for potential systemic causes of the patient's symptoms and elevated IOP. This may include a chest X-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan to evaluate for pulmonary disease, as well as laboratory tests to evaluate for other systemic conditions that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms and elevated IOP.

**Answer**:D. Perform an emergency orbital exploration with lesion biopsy

**Explanation**:

The patient's symptoms of acute unilateral proptosis, binocular diplopia, and right periorbital pain and swelling, along with the MRI findings of an intraconal mass, suggest a possible orbital cellulitis or abscess. The presence of a well-circumscribed and homogenous lesion with low internal reflectivity on B-scan ultrasonography supports this diagnosis.

Option A, admitting the patient to the hospital for a course of intravenous antibiotics, may be appropriate for the treatment of orbital cellulitis, but it is not the most urgent step in management.

Option B, ordering a homovanillic acid and vanillylmandelic acid test, is not relevant to the patient's current condition and would not help in making an urgent decision.

Option C, starting high-dose steroids, may be considered in the management of orbital inflammation, but it is not the most appropriate step in this emergency situation.

Therefore, the correct answer is option D, performing an emergency orbital exploration with lesion biopsy. This is the most appropriate step in managing the patient's acute unilateral proptosis and suspected orbital cellulitis or abscess, as it allows for prompt diagnosis and treatment of the underlying condition, potentially preventing further vision loss or other complications.

Sure! Here's my explanation:

**Answer**: A. Rosai-Dorfman disease

Rosai-Dorfman disease is a rare benign condition characterized by the proliferation of histiocytes, which are a type of immune cell, in the lymph nodes and other tissues. The histiocytes in Rosai-Dorfman disease have a distinctive appearance under a microscope, with a round, eccentric nucleus and a abundant, pale-staining cytoplasm that contains phagocytosed lymphocytes, also known as emperipolesis.

The patient's symptoms of nasal obstruction, dysphonia, recurrent deep neck abscesses, and tender, bulky cervical lymphadenopathy are consistent with Rosai-Dorfman disease. The patient's age is also consistent with the typical age range for Rosai-Dorfman disease, which affects children and young adults.

The patient's workup, including a normal QuantiFERON-TB Gold test and negative serum IgG, IgM, IgA, and IgE levels, is also consistent with Rosai-Dorfman disease, as the condition is not associated with any specific infectious or autoimmune disorders.

The patient's imaging studies, including the CT and MRI scans, show enlarged cervical lymph nodes and enhancing nodules in the left laryngeal ventricle, right false vocal cord, and right tracheal wall, which are consistent with Rosai-Dorfman disease. The patient's endoscopy and operative microlaryngoscopy findings, which showed yellow submucosal masses in the left nasal cavity, left laryngeal ventricle, and right trachea, are also consistent with Rosai-Dorfman disease.

The patient's biopsy results, which showed a prominent infiltrate of benign-appearing histiocytes with numerous forms showing emperipolesis and some nuclei showing distinct central nucleoli, are diagnostic of Rosai-Dorfman disease. The positive immunohistochemical staining for S100 and negative staining

**Answer**: C. Secondary syphilis

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with secondary syphilis. The patient's painful lesions on the tongue, which are bilateral and larger on the right side, are consistent with the characteristic mouth ulcers seen in secondary syphilis. The patient's history of mild initial improvement followed by symptom progression is also consistent with the natural history of syphilis. Additionally, the patient's tender and hairy appearance of the lesions, as well as the absence of any other notable medical history, are also consistent with secondary syphilis.

The other answer choices are less likely possibilities:

A. Oral hairy leukoplakia: This is a condition characterized by the growth of hair-like projections on the tongue, which can be caused by various factors such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and viral infections. While the patient's lesions have a slightly hairy appearance, they are not typical of oral hairy leukoplakia, which tends to be more diffuse and not limited to one side of the tongue.

B. Multifocal squamous cell carcinoma in situ: This is a type of skin cancer that can occur in the mouth. While the patient's lesions are multifocal, they are not typical of squamous cell carcinoma in situ, which tends to be more ulcerative and have a more irregular border. Additionally, the patient's age is relatively young for this diagnosis.

D. Herpetic infection: Herpetic infections can cause mouth ulcers, but the patient's history of mild initial improvement followed by symptom progression is not typical of herpes simplex virus infection. Additionally, the absence of any other symptoms such as fever, fatigue, or rash suggests that the patient's condition is not likely due to a viral infection.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, as well as the absence of any other notable medical history, secondary syphilis is the most likely diagnosis.

**Answer**: C. Optical coherence tomography

The correct answer is C. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) because it is a non-invasive imaging test that can provide detailed cross-sectional images of the retina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and can help diagnose and monitor retinal diseases, including those caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.

The patient's symptoms of bilateral blurry vision, large blue paracentral scotomata, and a migraine without a scintillating scotoma, along with the physical examination findings of subtle reddish geographic irregularities at the level of the retinal pigment epithelial at a nasal juxtafoveal location in both eyes, suggest a possible retinal or RPE disorder. OCT can help to confirm the diagnosis and provide additional information about the nature and extent of the disorder.

In contrast, genetic testing (choice A) may not be necessary at this point in the patient's evaluation, as the symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a more acute process rather than a genetic disorder. Electroretinogram (choice B) is a test that measures the electrical activity of the retina and can be used to diagnose and monitor retinal diseases, but it may not provide the same level of detail as OCT. Fluorescein angiography (choice D) is an invasive test that involves injecting a dye into the bloodstream and may not be necessary at this stage of the patient's evaluation.

Therefore, C. Optical coherence tomography is the most appropriate answer.

**Answer**: D. Hypotrichosis simplex of the scalp

Hypotrichosis simplex of the scalp is a rare condition characterized by sparse, short, and soft hair on the scalp. It is often associated with a normal hair growth cycle, but there is a defect in the formation of the hair shaft, leading to weak and brittle hairs that are prone to breakage.

In this case, the patient presented with a 6-year history of progressive hair loss, with diffuse, sparse, and abnormally short hair over the entire scalp. The surface of the scalp was smooth, without inflammatory changes or focal alopecic patches. The patient denied experiencing a stressful event recently, and no habitual pulling of hair was observed by her family. These findings are consistent with hypotrichosis simplex of the scalp.

The punch biopsy showed a mild lymphocytic perifollicular infiltrate and increased telogen hair with decreased anagen-to-telogen ratio, which is also consistent with hypotrichosis simplex of the scalp. The hair pull test was positive with predominantly anagen hair extracted, further supporting the diagnosis.

Now, let's discuss why the other choices are incorrect:

A. Short anagen syndrome: This is a condition where the hair growth cycle is normal, but the anagen phase is shorter than usual, leading to short hair. In this case, the patient's hair was not only short but also sparse and brittle, which is not consistent with short anagen syndrome.

B. Loose anagen syndrome: This is a condition where the hair shaft is loose and easily removable, leading to excessive hair shedding. In this case, the patient's hair was not loose or easily removable, and there was no history of excessive hair shedding.

C. Trichodental dysplasia: This is a rare genetic disorder characterized by microdontia, hypodontia, and abnormal hair growth. In this case, there was no evidence of microdontia or hypodontia, and the patient's hair growth was not abnormal in terms of density

Answer:**C**. Eruptive pruritic papular porokeratosis (EPPP) is the correct answer.

Explanation:

A. Annular lichen planus: This is an autoimmune disease that affects the skin and mucous membranes. It is characterized by the development of distinctive lesions, including flat-topped papules, plaques, and scaly patches. While it can cause pruritus, the distribution of lesions on the extremities, the absence of mucosal involvement, and the lack of skin thickening and pigmentation do not support this diagnosis.

B. Perforating granuloma annulare: This is a rare disease characterized by the development of small, flesh-colored or slightly pigmented papules with a central crust or ulceration. It is usually found on the extremities, but the distribution of lesions in this case is not consistent with that of perforating granuloma annulare. Additionally, the absence of any notable medical or family history and the lack of skin thickening and pigmentation argue against this diagnosis.

D. Atypical pityriasis rosea: This is a rare variant of pityriasis rosea, a condition characterized by the development of large, oval or circular, scaly patches on the trunk and extremities. Atypical pityriasis rosea can present with smaller, more widespread lesions, but the distribution of lesions in this case, as well as the absence of any notable medical or family history, argues against this diagnosis.

C. Eruptive pruritic papular porokeratosis (EPPP): This is a rare condition characterized by the development of numerous small, intensely pruritic papules on the extremities. The lesions are typically distributed in a symmetrical or asymmetrical pattern and can be associated with other skin conditions, such as eczema. The patient's history of eczema and the distribution and characteristics of the lesions support this diagnosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Eruptive pruritic papular porokeratosis (EPPP).

**Answer**:C. Address all modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, initiate cascade screening, and start high-intensity statin therapy and aspirin, 81 mg, daily

The correct answer is C. Address all modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, initiate cascade screening, and start high-intensity statin therapy and aspirin, 81 mg, daily.

Let's examine each choice in detail:

A. Counsel on lifestyle modifications and initiate cascade screening to identify first-degree relatives with elevated Lp(a):
This choice is incorrect because while lifestyle modifications and cascade screening are important, they are not the most urgent steps to take in this situation. The patient's elevated Lp(a) level and coronary calcium score indicate a high risk of cardiovascular events, and immediate medical interventions are necessary.

B. Start high-intensity statin therapy and aspirin, 81 mg, daily:
This choice is incorrect because while high-intensity statin therapy and aspirin may be appropriate for this patient, they should not be started without addressing all modifiable cardiovascular risk factors and initiating cascade screening. The patient's family history and elevated Lp(a) level suggest a high risk of cardiovascular events, and a comprehensive approach is necessary to mitigate that risk.

D. Start PCSK9 inhibitor therapy such as evolocumab or alirocumab to lower Lp(a) level:
This choice is incorrect because PCSK9 inhibitors are not recommended as first-line therapy for elevated Lp(a) levels. While they may be considered for patients with familial hypercholesterolemia or severe hyperlipidemia, the patient's lipid profile does not indicate a need for such therapy at this time.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Address all modifiable cardiovascular risk factors, initiate cascade screening, and start high-intensity statin therapy and aspirin, 81 mg, daily. This approach addresses the patient's immediate risk factors

**Answer**:D. Mitochondrial ataxia

The patient's symptoms, such as progressive imbalance, fear of falling, gaze-evoked horizontal nystagmus, slow saccades, and ataxic dysarthria, are consistent with a diagnosis of cerebellar ataxia. The absence of stretch reflexes and mute plantar fascia, as well as the presence of bilateral hammertoes, suggest a sensory neuronopathy. The patient's history of hypercholesterolemia and anxiety may also be relevant to the patient's overall health and potential treatment plan, but they are not directly related to the patient's ataxia symptoms.

The brain MRI findings of diffuse cerebellar atrophy and T2 hyperintensities in the bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles, cerebellar white matter, pons, and bilateral thalamus, are consistent with a diagnosis of mitochondrial ataxia. Mitochondrial ataxia is a group of disorders that result from mutations in mitochondrial DNA, which lead to impaired mitochondrial function and energy production. This impairment can affect various systems in the body, including the nervous system, leading to symptoms such as ataxia, seizures, and cognitive decline.

Friedreich ataxia (choice A) is a rare genetic disorder that causes progressive loss of coordination and balance, as well as other symptoms such as heart disease and vision loss. It is caused by a mutation in the FXN gene, which codes for the protein frataxin. While Friedreich ataxia can also cause cerebellar atrophy and other MRI findings similar to those seen in mitochondrial ataxia, the patient's history of hypercholesterolemia and anxiety do not fit with the typical clinical presentation of Friedreich ataxia.

Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (choice B) is a genetic disorder that is associated with a mutation in the FMR1 gene, which codes for the protein fragile X mental retardation protein 1. This disorder typically presents

The correct answer is C: Inject a local anesthetic into the area of maximal tenderness.

The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, particularly in the left lower quadrant, and the physical examination findings of tenderness to palpation and hypoesthesia, suggest the possibility of a localized abdominal wall pain or inflammation. Injecting a local anesthetic into the area of maximal tenderness can help to confirm this diagnosis and provide temporary relief of pain.

Administering gabapentin (choice A) may be appropriate for managing chronic abdominal pain, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as the patient's symptoms are acute and localized.

Assessing celiac artery flow (choice B) may be relevant in cases of suspected bowel ischemia or other vascular disorders, but it is not directly related to the patient's current symptoms and physical examination findings.

Measuring urine porphobilinogen level (choice D) is used to diagnose porphyria, a group of rare genetic disorders that can cause abdominal pain, but it is not relevant to the patient's symptoms or physical examination findings.

Therefore, the best next step would be to inject a local anesthetic into the area of maximal tenderness to confirm the diagnosis of localized abdominal wall pain and provide temporary pain relief.

**Answer**:B. Obtain Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM and IgG levels

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, including fever, cough, mucositis, and vesiculobullous skin lesions, suggest a possible diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. Mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common cause of community-acquired pneumonia and can also cause mucocutaneous lesions, such as vesiculobullous lesions. The presence of bilateral lower lobe infiltrates on the chest computed tomography scan also supports this diagnosis.

Therefore, it is appropriate to obtain Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM and IgG levels to confirm the diagnosis. IgM antibodies are typically present in the early stages of infection, while IgG antibodies persist longer and can indicate past infection or immunity.

Option A, performing a pathergy test for Behçet disease, is not relevant to the patient's symptoms or possible diagnosis. Behçet disease is a rare autoimmune disorder that can cause vasculitis, and a pathergy test is used to diagnose it.

Option C, performing an echocardiogram, may be appropriate if the patient had symptoms or signs of cardiac involvement, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, or murmurs. However, there is no indication of cardiac involvement in the patient's presentation.

Option D, testing for monkeypox virus, is not relevant to the patient's symptoms or possible diagnosis. Monkeypox is a rare viral infection that can cause fever, headache, and rash, but it is not typically associated with mucositis or vesiculobullous skin lesions.

**Answer**:A. Administer empirical broad-spectrum intraperitoneal antibiotics

Explanation:
The patient presented with severe abdominal pain and cloudy PD fluid, which suggests peritonitis. The patient's history of breaking aseptic technique during PD catheter tubing connection increases the likelihood of infection. Empirical broad-spectrum intraperitoneal antibiotics should be administered promptly to treat suspected peritonitis, as they can help reduce inflammation, prevent further tissue damage, and improve patient outcomes.

Choice B (Administer empirical broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics) is incorrect because intravenous antibiotics may not penetrate the peritoneal cavity effectively, and may not reach therapeutic levels in the peritoneal fluid.

Choice C (Await peritoneal dialysis fluid culture results before starting intraperitoneal antibiotics) is incorrect because awaiting culture results may delay treatment and potentially worsen the patient's condition. In peritonitis, prompt administration of antibiotics is crucial to prevent further tissue damage and improve outcomes.

Choice D (Send blood cultures) is incorrect because blood cultures may not be helpful in diagnosing peritonitis, and may not guide antibiotic treatment. While blood cultures can help diagnose sepsis, they may not detect infections limited to the peritoneal cavity.

D. Delayed iatrogenic bilateral vocal fold paralysis (BVFP) is the correct answer.

The patient's symptoms of odynophagia, dysphagia, shortness of breath, stridor, and bilateral vocal fold paralysis, as well as the physical examination findings of a prominent posterior pharyngeal wall, subtle asymmetry of vocal fold motion, and pooling of secretions in the left pyriform, are consistent with delayed-onset bilateral vocal fold paralysis following anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgery.

The patient's history of anterior cervical spinal plate placement and posterior spinal decompression and fusion surgery suggests that the paralysis may have been caused by iatrogenic injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which is a known complication of cervical spine surgery. The delayed onset of symptoms, which occurred 5 months after surgery, is also consistent with this diagnosis.

The other answer choices do not fit the patient's symptoms and clinical findings as well as the history of cervical spine surgery.

Arnold-Chiari malformation (choice A) is a congenital condition characterized by herniation of the cerebellar tonsils through the foramen magnum. While it can cause symptoms such as dysphagia and odynophagia, it is not typically associated with bilateral vocal fold paralysis or a prominent posterior pharyngeal wall.

Spinal abscess causing laryngeal edema (choice B) is an infectious complication that can cause vocal fold paralysis, but it would not explain the delayed onset of symptoms or the absence of fever, chills, or other signs of infection.

Idiopathic bilateral vocal fold paralysis (choice C) is a rare condition of unknown cause that can present with symptoms similar to those described in the case, but it is not associated with a history of cervical spine surgery.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Delayed iatrogenic bilateral vocal fold paralysis (BVFP

**Answer**:A. Observation

Explanation:

A. Observation is the correct answer because the patient's pigmented iris lesion has been stable in size for decades, and there have been no recent changes in their health or vision. The patient's age and lack of symptoms also suggest that the lesion is likely benign. Observation is the appropriate management for a stable, asymptomatic iris lesion, as it allows for close monitoring of the lesion without exposing the patient to the risks of surgical intervention.

B. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy is not the best answer because it is not necessary to perform a biopsy on a stable, asymptomatic iris lesion. Biopsy may be considered if there is a sudden change in the size or shape of the lesion, or if there are symptoms such as pain, redness, or vision changes.

C. Plaque brachytherapy is not appropriate for this patient because it is a treatment for malignant lesions, and there is no indication that the patient's iris lesion is malignant.

D. Iridectomy for excision of the lesion is not the best answer because it is an invasive surgical procedure that carries risks such as cataract formation, glaucoma, and vision loss. As the lesion is stable and asymptomatic, it is not necessary to perform surgery at this time. Close observation is the appropriate management for this patient.

**Answer**: D. Cutaneous angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma

The correct answer is D. Cutaneous angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma, as it best matches the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

A. Cutaneous sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease that affects the skin and lungs. It is characterized by the formation of granulomas, which are clusters of immune cells that accumulate in response to an unknown trigger. While cutaneous sarcoidosis can cause skin nodules, the distribution of the nodules in this case is not typical for sarcoidosis, which usually affects the face, ears, and arms. Additionally, the patient's laboratory results do not support this diagnosis, as sarcoidosis is not associated with atypical lymphocytes in the peripheral blood or elevated CD4+/CD8+ lymphocyte ratio.

B. Lymphomatoid granulomatosis is a rare condition that is characterized by the formation of granulomas in the lungs, skin, and other organs. It can cause skin nodules, but the nodules are usually fewer in number and larger in size than those observed in this case. Moreover, lymphomatoid granulomatosis is associated with a high risk of developing lymphoma, which is not supported by the patient's laboratory results.

C. Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm is a rare hematologic malignancy that affects the bone marrow, blood, and lymph nodes. It is characterized by the presence of blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cells, which are immature cells that have a plasmacytoid morphology. While this condition can cause skin lesions, they are usually not nodular and are more often ulcerated or hemorrhagic. The patient's laboratory results do not support this diagnosis, as there is no evidence of bone marrow or lymph node involvement.

The correct answer is D. Nodular colloid degeneration.

Nodular colloid degeneration is a rare, benign condition that affects the oral mucosa, particularly the tongue. It is characterized by the formation of small, nodular masses that are composed of colloid material, which is a type of extracellular matrix rich in glycoproteins and proteoglycans. The masses are usually yellowish or white and have a cobblestone-like appearance, which is consistent with the description of the plaques in the patient's tongue.

The other answer choices are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and clinical findings:

A. Verrucous xanthoma is a type of benign growth that occurs on the skin, particularly on the palms and soles. It is characterized by a rough, scaly surface and is usually yellow or brown in color. While it can occur on the tongue, it is not typically associated with a cobblestone-like appearance.

B. Colloid milium–classic adult type is a type of benign growth that occurs on the skin, particularly on the face, neck, and arms. It is characterized by small, firm papules that are usually yellow or white in color. While it can occur on the tongue, it is not typically associated with a cobblestone-like appearance.

C. Nodular amyloidosis is a type of amyloidosis that affects the skin and subcutaneous tissue. It is characterized by the deposition of amyloid fibrils in the dermis, leading to the formation of firm, nodular masses. While it can occur on the tongue, it is not typically associated with a cobblestone-like appearance.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and clinical findings, the most likely diagnosis is nodular colloid degeneration.

**Answer**: C. Cutaneous protothecosis

Cutaneous protothecosis is a rare fungal infection caused by Prototheca wickerhamii. It typically presents as a chronic, indolent, papillomatous or nodular lesion on the skin, often with ulceration and crusting. The patient's history of a gradually increasing rash on the left forearm, with the development of plaques and ulcers, is consistent with cutaneous protothecosis. The patient's lack of systemic symptoms and concerns also supports this diagnosis, as cutaneous protothecosis is typically a localized infection.

The pathological findings, as shown in Figure B-D, also support the diagnosis of cutaneous protothecosis. The presence of hyperkeratosis, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, and a lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with neutrophils, plasma cells, and multinucleated giant cells in the dermis, are all consistent with cutaneous protothecosis. Additionally, the periodic acid-Schiff staining and transmission electron microscopy results, which showed the presence of Prototheca wickerhamii, confirm the diagnosis.

Now, let's discuss why the other answer choices are incorrect:

A. Chromoblastomycosis: Chromoblastomycosis is a fungal infection caused by Fonsecaea pedrosoi, which typically presents as a chronic, progressive, and painful verrucous lesion on the skin. While both chromoblastomycosis and cutaneous protothecosis can cause skin lesions, the patient's history and pathological findings are not consistent with chromoblastomycosis.

B. Cutaneous cryptococcosis: Cutaneous cryptococcosis is a fungal infection caused by Cryptococcus neoformans, which typically presents as a papule, nodule, or ulcer on the skin. While cutaneous cryptococcosis can cause skin lesions, the patient's lack of systemic symptoms and concerns, as well as the pathological findings, are not

**Answer**: C. Perform coronary angiography

The patient's presentation of intermittent chest pain and diaphoresis, along with a positive troponin T test result (16 ng/mL), suggests a possible acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The patient's history of smoking and hypertension also increases his risk for coronary artery disease (CAD).

Option A, discharging the patient home with outpatient cardiology follow-up, is not appropriate at this time. Although the patient's initial electrocardiogram (ECG) and laboratory results are unremarkable, the patient's symptoms and positive troponin T test result indicate a need for further testing to rule out ACS.

Option B, ordering a dobutamine stress echocardiogram, may be appropriate later in the patient's workup, but it is not the most appropriate next step. A dobutamine stress echocardiogram can help identify areas of potential ischemia, but it may not be able to definitively diagnose CAD in the presence of a normal resting echocardiogram.

Option D, reordering troponin T measurement in 3 hours, may also be appropriate later in the patient's workup, but it is not the most appropriate next step. While serial troponin measurements can help confirm or rule out ACS, a single elevated troponin T level (16 ng/mL) in the context of the patient's symptoms and risk factors is sufficient to warrant further testing.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step is option C, performing coronary angiography. Coronary angiography is a diagnostic test that can definitively diagnose or rule out CAD by visualizing the coronary arteries and identifying any blockages or stenosis. This test can help guide management and determine the appropriate course of treatment for the patient's symptoms and possible ACS.

**Answer**:C. Additional imaging, including a computed tomography and positron emission tomography scan

Explanation:

The patient presented with recurrent orbital hemorrhage, and the MRI scan showed an intraorbital lesion. The next step would be to further evaluate the lesion to determine its nature and potential treatment.

Option C, additional imaging, including a computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) scan, is the most appropriate choice. A CT scan can help to better define the size, location, and density of the lesion, while a PET scan can provide information on the metabolic activity of the lesion, which can help to differentiate between benign and malignant lesions.

Option A, clinical follow-up for idiopathic recurrent retrobulbar hemorrhage, is not appropriate at this stage, as the patient has already had two episodes of hemorrhage, and the MRI scan has revealed an intraorbital lesion. Further imaging is needed to determine the cause of the hemorrhage and to guide management.

Option B, transconjunctival orbital biopsy, may be considered, but it is not the most appropriate choice at this stage. Biopsy carries a risk of complications, such as bleeding, infection, and visual loss, and it may not provide a definitive diagnosis. Imaging studies can often provide sufficient information to guide management, and biopsy may be considered later if necessary.

Option D, arteriography to look for orbital vascular malformations, is not relevant in this case, as the patient has a history of recurrent orbital hemorrhage and an intraorbital lesion has been identified on MRI. Arteriography may be considered if the patient has a history of vascular anomalies or if there is a suspicion of a vascular malformation, but it is not the most appropriate choice in this scenario.

**Answer**: C. Consider treating the left eye with intra-arterial melphalan

The patient in this case has treatment-refractory nodular scleritis, which is a type of inflammatory eye disease that is resistant to treatment with corticosteroids. The patient has already been taking oral prednisone and topical prednisolone acetate without relief, and has a history of RDD disease.

Intra-arterial melphalan is a chemotherapy drug that is sometimes used to treat severe eye inflammation that is resistant to other treatments. It works by reducing the blood supply to the affected tissue, which can help to reduce inflammation. In this case, considering intra-arterial melphalan is a reasonable next step because the patient's inflammation is severe and has not responded to other treatments.

The other answer choices are not as appropriate for several reasons:

A. Switch oral ibuprofen to oral flurbiprofen: While flurbiprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can be used to treat inflammation, it is not likely to be effective in treating severe inflammation that is resistant to corticosteroids.

B. Initiate an alternative systemic therapy (ie, an immunomodulatory agent): While immunomodulatory agents such as methotrexate or azathioprine can be effective in treating inflammatory eye diseases, they may not be as effective as intra-arterial melphalan in treating severe, treatment-refractory inflammation.

D. Administer subtenon triamcinolone to the left eye: Triamcinolone is a corticosteroid that can be used to treat inflammation, but administering it subtenon (ie, beneath the conjunctiva) may not be as effective as intra-arterial melphalan in treating severe, treatment-refractory inflammation.

Therefore, the best answer is C. Consider treating the left eye with intra-arterial melphalan.

**Answer**:B. Neoadjuvant cemiplimab immunotherapy (anti–PD-L1 antibody), globe sparing orbitotomy, and surgical excision of the mass

The patient in this scenario has a recurrent cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with orbital extension, which is a rare and aggressive type of cancer. The patient is also homeless and has a history of being lost to follow-up, which suggests that they may have limited access to healthcare resources and may not be able to tolerate more intensive treatment options.

Option A, partial debulking of the temple mass followed by cetuximab treatment, may be a reasonable option for some patients with locally advanced SCC, but it may not be the best choice for this patient for several reasons. First, the patient has already had a recurrence of the cancer after previous treatment, suggesting that the tumor may be aggressive and less likely to respond to debulking alone. Second, cetuximab is a targeted therapy that works by blocking the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), which is often overexpressed in SCC. However, the patient's tumor may have developed resistance to EGFR inhibitors, which could limit the effectiveness of cetuximab.

Option C, palliative radiotherapy, may be appropriate for patients with advanced SCC who have symptoms related to the tumor, such as pain or bleeding. However, this option does not address the underlying cancer and is not likely to improve the patient's long-term survival.

Option D, platinum-based chemotherapy, is a common treatment approach for SCC, but it may not be the best choice for this patient for several reasons. First, the patient has a history of being lost to follow-up, which suggests that they may have limited access to healthcare resources and may not be able to tolerate more intensive treatment options. Second, platinum-based chemotherapy can have significant side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and bone marrow suppression, which may be challenging for a patient with limited access to healthcare resources.

**Answer**:C. Perform pars plana vitrectomy and excisional biopsy of the membrane

The correct answer is C, Perform pars plana vitrectomy and excisional biopsy of the membrane, because it is the most appropriate way to diagnose and manage the pigmented epiretinal membrane (ERM) in this case.

A, Recommend intravitreal anti-VEGF injections for exudative age-related macular degeneration, is not the best option because the patient's symptoms and findings do not suggest exudative age-related macular degeneration. While the patient does have a history of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and has received intravitreal anti-VEGF injections in the past, the current presentation of decreased visual acuity and metamorphopsia suggests a different underlying cause.

B, Provide reassurance and recommend close observation, is not the best option because the patient's symptoms and findings indicate a more urgent need for intervention. The presence of a pigmented ERM can cause significant visual disturbances and potentially lead to retinal detachment, so it is important to address the issue promptly.

D, Prescribe topical and systemic steroids, is not the best option because steroids are not effective in treating ERMs. While steroids can be used to treat inflammatory conditions, they will not address the underlying cause of the pigmented ERM in this case.

Therefore, the best option is C, Perform pars plana vitrectomy and excisional biopsy of the membrane, which will allow for a definitive diagnosis of the pigmented ERM and provide the opportunity for removal of the membrane to improve the patient's vision.

**Answer**:B. Immunotherapy-related gastritis

The patient's history of recently initiated nivolumab therapy for metastatic HCC, along with the absence of other symptoms and the presence of diffuse inflammation and ulcerations on EGD, suggests immunotherapy-related gastritis as the most likely diagnosis. Immunotherapy-related gastritis is a known side effect of immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as nivolumab, and can present with similar symptoms and endoscopic findings as portal hypertensive gastropathy.

Option A, portal hypertensive gastropathy, is less likely given the patient's normal liver function tests and lack of other signs of liver dysfunction. Portal hypertensive gastropathy typically occurs in patients with advanced liver disease and portal hypertension, and is characterized by dilated veins, tortuous vessels, and red blood cell extravasation on EGD.

Option C, infectious gastritis, is also less likely given the patient's history of recent immunotherapy and the absence of other signs of infection, such as fever, chills, or abdominal tenderness. Infectious gastritis is typically caused by bacterial or viral infections and can present with symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.

Option D, liver cancer progression, is unlikely given the patient's previous treatment with curative intent surgical resection and the absence of other signs of liver dysfunction. While it is possible that the patient's cancer may have progressed, the patient's symptoms and endoscopic findings are not consistent with liver cancer progression.

**Answer**: C. Tophaceous gout

Tophaceous gout is a type of gout that affects the middle ear, causing the formation of a hard, painful mass in the mesotympanum, which is the area behind the eardrum. The symptoms of tophaceous gout are similar to those of cholesteatoma, including hearing loss, ear pain, and ear discharge. However, unlike cholesteatoma, tophaceous gout is not caused by a skin cyst or a retention of keratin debris, but rather by the accumulation of uric acid crystals in the middle ear.

In this case, the patient's symptoms of left-sided hearing loss and ear pain, along with the physical examination findings of a hard, painful mass in the mesotympanum, are consistent with tophaceous gout. The patient's history of myocardial infarction, sleep apnea, and Ménière disease may also suggest a higher risk of developing gout.

The other answer choices are less likely diagnoses for this patient's symptoms. Cholesteatoma (choice A) is a skin cyst that can form in the middle ear and cause similar symptoms, but it is not associated with the accumulation of uric acid crystals. Osteoma (choice B) is a benign bone tumor that can occur in the middle ear, but it is not typically associated with hearing loss or ear pain. Tympanosclerosis (choice D) is a condition where the tympanic membrane becomes thickened and scarred, leading to hearing loss, but it is not associated with the accumulation of uric acid crystals.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is tophaceous gout.

**Answer**:B. Foregut duplication cyst

The correct answer is B. Foregut duplication cyst because it aligns with the patient's symptoms and the findings from the imaging studies.

A. Thymic cyst is an incorrect choice because, although it can cause respiratory symptoms, it is typically located in the mediastinum and does not cause displacement of the trachea or esophagus.

C. Hemangioma is an incorrect choice because it is a benign vascular tumor that can occur in various locations, but it does not typically cause respiratory symptoms or displace adjacent structures.

D. Lymphatic malformation is an incorrect choice because it is a congenital abnormality of the lymphatic system that can cause respiratory symptoms, but it typically presents with a different set of symptoms, such as recurrent respiratory infections, coughing, and difficulty swallowing, and does not cause displacement of the trachea or esophagus.

In contrast, a foregut duplication cyst is a rare congenital abnormality that can cause respiratory symptoms, including stridor and dysphagia, and can displace adjacent structures, such as the trachea and esophagus. The imaging findings of a low-density lesion abutting the trachea and hypopharynx, with rightward displacement of the trachea and larynx, are consistent with a foregut duplication cyst. Therefore, B. Foregut duplication cyst is the correct answer.

**Answer**:C. Type 1 first branchial cleft cyst

The correct answer is C, Type 1 first branchial cleft cyst, because the patient's symptoms and the results of the imaging studies are consistent with this diagnosis.

A first branchial cleft cyst is a type of congenital cyst that arises from the embryonic branchial apparatus. It is a rare type of cyst, accounting for only about 0.5% of all congenital cysts. Type 1 first branchial cleft cysts are the most common subtype, accounting for about 70% of all first branchial cleft cysts.

The patient's symptoms of a slowly growing mass in the right postauricular area, with no other cysts, sinuses, or fistulas in the neck or ear, are consistent with a Type 1 first branchial cleft cyst. The mass was located in the subcutaneous fat layer superoposterior to the right auricle, which is a common location for first branchial cleft cysts.

The imaging studies also support this diagnosis. On temporal bone computed tomography, the cystic mass was hypodense, which suggests that it was filled with fluid or soft tissue. On temporal magnetic resonance imaging, the mass had high signal intensity on both T1-weighted and T2-weighted images, which is consistent with a fluid-filled cyst. The low signal intensity on enhanced T1-weighted fat suppression and T2-weighted short T1 inversion recovery images suggests that the cyst was surrounded by fatty tissue.

The histopathologic examination of the cyst also supports this diagnosis. The cyst was lined by keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium, which is consistent with a first branchial cleft cyst. The presence of hair follicles and sebaceous glands in the cyst is also consistent with this diagnosis, as first branchial cleft cysts often contain these structures.

In contrast, the other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.

**Answer**:B. Laryngeal sarcoidosis

The patient's symptoms of odynophonia, globus sensation, and mild dysphagia to solids, along with the physical examination findings of a severely edematous epiglottis, posterior pharyngeal wall, aryepiglottic folds, and arytenoids, are consistent with laryngeal inflammation and swelling. The patient's history of chronic laryngitis and treatment with steroids and amoxicillin without improvement also support this diagnosis.

The laboratory findings of elevated antinuclear antibodies and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, as well as the normal results of a comprehensive metabolic panel, thyroid-stimulating hormone, and angiotensin-converting enzyme, are consistent with sarcoidosis. The chest radiography and computed tomography of the neck findings of edema of the supraglottis and posterior hypopharyngeal wall also support this diagnosis.

The pathology results of hyperplastic squamous mucosa with submucosal chronic inflammation and fibrosis, and scattered nonnecrotizing granulomas in the subepithelium, are diagnostic of laryngeal sarcoidosis.

Laryngopharyngeal reflux (choice A) may cause similar symptoms, but the patient's history and physical examination findings do not support this diagnosis. The patient's age and lack of shortness of breath also make this diagnosis less likely.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (choice C) is a systemic vasculitis that can affect the larynx, but the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings do not support this diagnosis. The patient's lack of respiratory symptoms and the absence of evidence of reflux esophagitis on esophagram also make this diagnosis less likely.

Laryngeal tuberculosis (choice D) is a rare condition that can present with similar symptoms, but the patient's history and laboratory findings do not support this diagnosis.

**Answer**: D. Pemphigoid nodularis

The correct answer is D. Pemphigoid nodularis, as it matches the clinical presentation and histopathological findings described in the case.

A. Prurigo nodularis is an autoimmune disorder characterized by intensely pruritic, crusted, and inflamed nodules on the skin, often associated with other conditions such as atopic dermatitis, eczema, or psoriasis. While the clinical presentation of prurigo nodularis may resemble the case described, the histopathological findings are different. In prurigo nodularis, there is typically a dense infiltrate of lymphocytes, histiocytes, and neutrophils in the dermis, with minimal fibrosis. In contrast, the biopsy specimen in the case showed marked hyperkeratosis, acanthosis with irregular elongation of the rete ridges, fibrotic dermis, and perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate, which are consistent with pemphigoid nodularis.

B. Acquired perforating dermatosis (APD) is a rare condition characterized by the development of small, grouped, or coalescing papules and nodules on the skin, often associated with diabetes mellitus, obesity, or medication use. APD has a distinctive histopathological feature of perforation of the basement membrane zone, which was not observed in the biopsy specimen of the case.

C. Epidermolysis bullosa pruriginosa (EBP) is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by painful, pruritic, and fragile skin, leading to blistering and erosions. While EBP may present with nodular lesions, the histopathological findings are distinct from those of pemphigoid nodularis. In EBP, there is typically a subepidermal blister with a "dome-shaped" or "canoe-shaped" appearance, and the basement membrane zone is typically intact. In contrast, the biopsy specimen in the case showed a flat, fibrotic dermis, and periv

The patient's history of having 39 lesions, some of which were associated with ulceration and bleeding, and the absence of any known history of environmental or occupational exposure to hazardous substances, also support this diagnosis.

The other answer choices do not match the patient's symptoms and clinical findings:

A. Multifocal infantile hemangioma is a benign vascular tumor that typically appears as a red, blue, or purple lesion, and may have a characteristic "strawberry" appearance. While it can occur in infants, it does not typically present with the number and distribution of lesions described in this case.

B. Bacillary angiomatosis is a rare condition caused by infection with Bartonella henselae, and is characterized by the development of vascular lesions, fever, and swollen lymph nodes. It is not typically associated with the congenital and familial history described in this case.

C. Multifocal lymphangioendotheliomatosis with thrombocytopenia is a rare condition characterized by the development of multiple vascular tumors, thrombocytopenia, and a risk of bleeding. While it can present with cutaneous lesions, it is not typically associated with the other symptoms and clinical findings described in this case.

Therefore, D. Congenital disseminated pyogenic granuloma is the most appropriate diagnosis for this patient.

**Answer**: D. Neurovascular conflict of the oculomotor nerve

The correct answer is D, Neurovascular conflict of the oculomotor nerve, because the patient's symptoms of left-eye ptosis, hypotropia, and impaired supraduction are consistent with a neurovascular conflict affecting the oculomotor nerve. This can occur when a blood vessel compresses or conflicts with the nerve, leading to weakness or paralysis of the muscles controlled by the nerve. The absence of other cranial nerve deficits, normal laboratory test results, and negative imaging studies support this diagnosis.

**Answer**: A. Myasthenia gravis

Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder that can cause weakness or paralysis of the muscles, including those controlled by the oculomotor nerve. However, the patient's symptoms are not consistent with myasthenia gravis, as the ptosis and hypotropia are not fatigable and there is no history of joint pain or constitutional symptoms. Additionally, the patient's laboratory test results and imaging studies do not support this diagnosis.

**Answer**: B. Holmes Adie pupil

Holmes Adie pupil is a condition characterized by a large, bilateral pupil that is not reactive to light. This can occur due to a lesion in the oculomotor nerve or the pupillary light reflex arc. However, the patient's pupillary reflexes are normal, and there is no evidence of a lesion affecting the oculomotor nerve.

**Answer**: C. Posterior communicating artery aneurysm that is not picked up on CT angiography

A posterior communicating artery aneurysm can cause compression of the oculomotor nerve, leading to symptoms similar to those described in the case.

**Answer**:A. Isolate the patient and notify public health authorities

Explanation:

A. Isolate the patient and notify public health authorities is the correct answer because the patient's symptoms, such as malaise, chills, night sweats, sore throat with difficulty swallowing, and a skin rash, suggest a possible infectious disease. The presence of a dome-shaped umbilicated nodule on the eyelid and conjunctival hyperemia also indicate an infectious process. Isolating the patient and notifying public health authorities is necessary to prevent the spread of the infection and to identify the causative agent.

B. Administer imiquimod is incorrect because imiquimod is a medication used to treat viral infections, such as herpes simplex virus and human papillomavirus. While it may be considered as a treatment option for the patient's skin rash, it is not the appropriate first step in managing the patient's symptoms.

C. Perform lesion excision by unroofing and curettage is incorrect because this procedure is typically used to remove benign skin lesions, such as keratoses or sebaceous hyperplasia. It is not appropriate for managing infectious diseases, and it may not be necessary given the patient's young age and lack of significant medical history.

D. Administer oral acyclovir is incorrect because acyclovir is an antiviral medication used to treat herpes simplex virus infections. While it may be considered as a treatment option for the patient's skin rash, it is not the appropriate first step in managing the patient's symptoms, and it may not be effective against other types of infectious agents.

Therefore, the correct answer is A. Isolate the patient and notify public health authorities.

The correct answer is C. Request genetic testing and monitor.

The patient's history of a full-term birth by cesarean delivery from an uncomplicated pregnancy and healthy, nonconsanguineous parents suggests that the likelihood of a genetic disorder is higher. The presence of a white retinal lesion with calcification in an 11-year-old boy without any other ocular symptoms or systemic findings also raises the possibility of a genetic disorder. Therefore, requesting genetic testing and monitoring the patient's condition closely is the most appropriate next step.

Option A, ordering orbital magnetic resonance imaging, may be necessary later on to further evaluate the lesion, but it is not the most appropriate next step. The patient's young age and lack of symptoms make it unlikely that the lesion is caused by a space-occupying orbital mass.

Option B, biopsying the lesion, is not the most appropriate next step because it carries a risk of complications, such as retinal detachment or bleeding, and may not provide a definitive diagnosis. Biopsy may be considered later on if the lesion shows signs of growth or change, but at this point, it is more appropriate to monitor the patient's condition and consider genetic testing.

Option D, ruling out infectious diseases, is not the most appropriate next step because there are no signs of infection, such as inflammation or vitritis, and the patient's history does not suggest exposure to any infectious agents. While it is important to consider the possibility of infection, it is not the most likely diagnosis in this case.

Therefore, the best answer is C. Request genetic testing and monitor.

**Answer**: B. Genetic testing to assess for ocular diseases

The patient's symptoms, including changes in the retinal pigment epithelium, abnormal foveal contour, and intraretinal cystoid cavities, suggest a possible genetic disorder. Genetic testing can help identify specific genetic mutations that may be causing the patient's condition. This information can be used to guide further management and treatment decisions.

**Answer**: A. Perform B-scan ultrasonography

While B-scan ultrasonography may be useful in evaluating certain eye conditions, it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a retinal disorder, and B-scan ultrasonography is not likely to provide additional information that would help diagnose or manage the patient's condition.

**Answer**: C. Observation

Observation may be appropriate for some eye conditions, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a potentially serious retinal disorder that requires further evaluation and management.

**Answer**: D. Obtain fundus autofluorescence

Fundus autofluorescence is a diagnostic test that can provide information about the retinal tissue, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. While it may be useful in evaluating certain retinal disorders, it is not likely to provide additional information that would help diagnose or manage the patient's condition given the patient's symptoms and examination findings.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Genetic testing to assess for ocular diseases.

**Answer**:C. Observation

The correct answer is C. Observation because the patient's current condition does not require any surgical or medical intervention. The patient's visual acuity has improved from light perception to 20/70, and the vitreous debris has improved with 1+ vitritis and numerous superficial, round, white lesions spread throughout the fundus in all 4 quadrants and in the macula. Optical coherence tomography verified the preretinal location of the lesions. These signs indicate that the patient is recovering well from the endophthalmitis and the treatment has been effective.

Repeating intravitreal antibiotics (A) may not be necessary at this point, as the patient's condition has improved, and there is no signs of active infection. Performing a pars plana vitrectomy with vitreous biopsy (B) may be an invasive procedure that could potentially cause more harm than benefit, especially since the patient's condition is improving. Intravitreal antifungals (D) would not be appropriate, as there is no evidence of fungal infection.

Therefore, the best course of action would be to observe the patient closely and monitor their condition to ensure that the improvement continues and there are no signs of recurrence of the infection.

**Answer**: B. Injection of subconjunctival lidocaine followed by surgical removal of the lesion

The patient presented with a painful and pruritic lower eyelid lesion with a vermiform appearance, which resolved after 1 month, but was followed by redness and swelling of the inner part of her right conjunctiva. The patient had recently immigrated from rural Moldova, where she had exposure to farm animals, including dogs and cats.

Given the patient's history and symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is a conjunctival tumor, possibly a papilloma or a squamous cell carcinoma. The patient's exposure to farm animals increases the likelihood of a zoonotic infection, such as bovine papillomavirus, which can cause conjunctival papillomas.

The correct answer, B. Injection of subconjunctival lidocaine followed by surgical removal of the lesion, is the appropriate management for a conjunctival tumor. The injection of subconjunctival lidocaine will help to anesthetize the area and reduce discomfort during the surgical procedure. Surgical removal of the lesion will allow for histopathological examination to confirm the diagnosis and ensure complete removal of the tumor.

The other answer choices are not appropriate for the management of a conjunctival tumor:

A. Cryotherapy of the conjunctival lesion and adjuvant therapy with interferon alfa-2b: Cryotherapy is a treatment option for some types of conjunctival tumors, but it is not the first line of treatment for a papilloma or squamous cell carcinoma. Adjuvant therapy with interferon alfa-2b may be considered for some types of conjunctival tumors, but it is not a standard treatment for papillomas or squamous cell carcinomas.

**Answer**: D. Solitary fibrous tumor

The diagnosis of Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) is based on the combination of clinical, radiological, and histopathological features.

Clinically, the patient presented with a slow-growing mass in the left cheek, which is consistent with the indolent growth pattern of SFTs. The absence of symptoms such as pain, numbness, or facial nerve weakness also supports the diagnosis of SFT, as these tumors are usually asymptomatic.

Radiologically, the contrast-enhanced maxillofacial computed tomography (CT) scan showed a well-circumscribed, rounded mass in the anterior aspect of the left masticator space, which is consistent with the typical location of SFTs in the head and neck region. The peripheral rim of hyperenhancing soft tissue with a central cystic/necrotic component also supports the diagnosis of SFT, as these tumors often show a "target sign" or "bull's-eye" appearance on contrast-enhanced imaging.

Histopathologically, the core biopsy demonstrated a spindle cell neoplasm of uncertain origin, which is consistent with the histological appearance of SFTs. The negative immunostaining for cytokeratin (CK8/18), S100, and SOX10, and the negative staining for myosin and smooth muscle actin (SMA) also support the diagnosis of SFT, as these tumors are negative for these markers. The diffuse positive staining for STAT6, a transcription factor that is specific to SFTs, further supports the diagnosis.

In contrast, Myopericytoma (choice A) is a rare benign tumor that arises from the pericytic cells lining blood vessels. It typically affects the soft tissues of the head and neck, but the clinical and radiological features are not specific, and the histopathological features are distinct from SFTs. Synovial sarcoma (choice B) is a malignant tumor that arises from the synovial tissue of joints, tendons, and bursae. It can occur in

**Answer**: C. Neuromuscular choristoma

The correct answer is C. Neuromuscular choristoma because it is a benign tumor that originates from the facial nerve and is characterized by a combination of neural and muscular elements. The patient's symptoms of congenital left hemifacial weakness and chronic unilateral left-sided hearing loss, as well as the physical examination findings of grade VI peripheral left facial paralysis, are consistent with a neuromuscular choristoma affecting the facial nerve.

The MRI and CT findings also support this diagnosis, as the mass is located within the internal auditory canal and is in close contact with the left middle cerebral fossa, without intraparenchymal extension. The hypointensity on T2 and isointensity on T1, along with strong enhancement after gadolinium injection, are also consistent with a neuromuscular choristoma.

In contrast, the other answer choices do not fit the patient's symptoms and imaging findings as well.

A. Facial nerve schwannoma is a benign tumor that originates from the covering of the facial nerve and is typically slow-growing. While it may cause facial weakness or paralysis, it is less likely to cause hearing loss.

B. Vestibular nerve schwannoma is a benign tumor that originates from the vestibular portion of the inner ear and is typically associated with symptoms of vertigo, nausea, and unsteadiness. It is less likely to cause facial weakness or hearing loss.

D. Hemangioma is a benign tumor that originates from blood vessels and is typically associated with a red or purple discoloration of the skin. It is not typically associated with facial weakness or hearing loss.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is C. Neuromuscular choristoma.

**Answer**:A. Pyoderma gangrenosum

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare, ulcerative, and neutrophilic dermatosis that is often associated with underlying systemic diseases, such as immunoglobulin A monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS), as in this case. The patient's history of MGUS and the rapid progression of the lesion, despite multiple courses of antibiotics, suggest an underlying immune-mediated process.

The patient's symptoms, such as the tender, draining lesion on the central face, and the negative review of systems for fevers, night sweats, weight loss, headache, vision changes, respiratory distress, or arthralgias, are consistent with PG. The violaceous plaque with focal purulent drainage on the left nasal dorsum and medial cheek, which rapidly expanded into a vegetative, freely draining plaque covering the cheeks and glabella, is also characteristic of PG.

The histopathological analysis and tissue cultures showed suppurative and granulomatous dermatitis, which is consistent with PG. The negative results for tissue culture and QuantiFERON-TB Gold test suggest that the lesion is not caused by an infectious agent, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

In contrast, Lupus vulgaris (B) is a cutaneous form of lupus erythematosus that typically presents with discoid lesions on the face, scalp, and ears. Coccidioidomycosis (C) is a fungal infection that can cause skin lesions, but it is not typically associated with a history of MGUS or rapid progression of lesions. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (D) is a systemic vasculitis that can cause skin lesions, but it typically presents with a history of respiratory symptoms, such as cough, hemoptysis, and shortness of breath, which are not present in this case.

Therefore, based on the patient's history, symptoms, and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is Pyoderma gangrenos

**Answer**:C. Start treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin and amiodarone

The correct answer is C. Start treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin and amiodarone, because the patient presents with supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) following mitral valve surgery, which is a potentially life-threatening condition that requires urgent treatment.

A. Perform urgent DC shock, is not the correct answer, as DC shock is not recommended as a first-line therapy for SVT, especially in patients with a history of cardiac surgery. DC shock carries a risk of inducing ventricular fibrillation and is generally reserved for cases where other therapies have failed.

B. Place a temporary pacemaker, is also not the correct answer, as the patient's rhythm is regular and there is no indication for a pacemaker. Additionally, placing a temporary pacemaker would not address the underlying cause of the SVT.

D. Order an urgent electrophysiologic investigation, is not the correct answer, as this would not provide immediate treatment for the patient's condition. While an electrophysiologic investigation may be useful in diagnosing the underlying cause of the SVT, it is not a priority in the emergency department setting where the patient's condition needs to be stabilized first.

Starting treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin and amiodarone, on the other hand, is a appropriate approach as it addresses the underlying cause of the SVT and can effectively convert the rhythm back to normal sinus rhythm. Low-molecular-weight heparin is a commonly used anticoagulant that can help prevent further episodes of SVT, while amiodarone is an anti-arrhythmic drug that can help convert the rhythm back to normal sinus rhythm.

**Answer**:D. Eosinophilic fasciitis

The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with eosinophilic fasciitis, a rare inflammatory condition that affects the fascia and underlying tissues. The patient's limited mobility of joints, particularly in the hands and feet, and the presence of the "prayer sign" and "groove sign" are characteristic features of this condition. The patient's elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels also support this diagnosis.

Myotonic dystrophy (Answer A) is a genetic disorder that affects muscle function and can cause muscle stiffness and limited mobility. However, it does not typically cause the type of skin changes or elevated inflammatory markers seen in this patient.

Systemic sclerosis (Answer B) is a connective tissue disorder that can cause skin thickening and limited mobility in the hands and feet. However, it typically presents with more widespread skin involvement and internal organ damage, which is not seen in this patient.

Deep morphea (morphea profunda) (Answer C) is a type of localized scleroderma that can cause skin thickening and limited mobility in the affected area. However, it typically does not cause the type of joint limited mobility seen in this patient, and the skin changes are typically more pronounced.

Eosinophilic fasciitis (Answer D) is a rare inflammatory condition that affects the fascia and underlying tissues, leading to limited mobility of joints, skin thickening, and inflammatory markers such as ESR and CRP. The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with this diagnosis.

**Answer**:C. Restart daily oral itraconazole

Explanation:
The patient has a history of recurrent skin, nail, and oral mucosal abnormalities that have previously responded to oral itraconazole. The patient's symptoms have recurred within 6 to 12 months of discontinuing itraconazole. The patient's recent presentation with white, moist, nonadherent plaques in the oral mucosa and moist red fissures at bilateral oral commissures, as well as thickened, yellowed toenails and scaly erythematous plaques on her lower legs and feet bilaterally, suggests a recurrence of the patient's previous condition.

Given the patient's history of recurrent symptoms and the recent presentation, it is likely that the patient has a fungal infection that has been successfully treated with itraconazole in the past. Therefore, the best course of action would be to restart daily oral itraconazole, which has been effective in managing the patient's symptoms in the past.

The other options are not as appropriate for several reasons:

A. Administer oral cefazolin: Cefazolin is an antibiotic that is effective against bacterial infections, but it is not effective against fungal infections. Therefore, it would not be an appropriate choice for this patient's condition.

B. Prescribe hydrocortisone cream: Hydrocortisone cream is a topical corticosteroid that is effective in reducing inflammation and itching associated with skin conditions. However, it is not effective against fungal infections and would not be appropriate for this patient's condition.

D. Treat with oral terbinafine: Terbinafine is an antifungal medication that is effective against fungal infections of the skin and nails. However, it has not been shown to be effective in managing oral mucosal abnormalities, which are a significant component of this patient's presentation. Therefore, it may not be the best choice for this patient's condition.

In summary, the best course of action would be to restart

**Answer**: D. Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbit

The correct answer is D. Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbit because it is the most appropriate diagnostic test to evaluate the patient's symptoms of right lagophthalmos and upper eyelid retraction. The patient's history of a functional pituitary adenoma and breast cancer in remission, as well as her use of tamoxifen therapy, suggest that there may be an underlying endocrine or inflammatory disorder causing the eyelid retraction. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbit can help to identify any structural abnormalities or inflammation in the orbit, including enlargement or invasion of the lacrimal gland, which could be causing the eyelid retraction.

In contrast, choice A, serum thyroid laboratory testing, may be relevant for evaluating thyroid function, but it would not provide information about the underlying cause of the eyelid retraction. Choice B, upper eyelid gold weight implantation, is a surgical procedure that may be considered for treatment of blepharoptosis or eyelid retraction, but it is not a diagnostic test and would not help to identify the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Choice C, systemic steroid and antiviral therapy, may be appropriate for treating certain inflammatory or infectious conditions affecting the eye, but it would not be the most appropriate next step in this patient's evaluation, given the absence of any evidence of infection or inflammation.

**Answer**:C. Observation with close follow-up

The patient in this case has a history of cutaneous melanoma and a pigmented corneal mass in the right eye. The patient denies any changes in vision, flashes, floaters, eye pain, or eye redness, and the visual acuity and intraocular pressure are within normal limits. The anterior segment examination shows inferior corneal endothelial pigmentation in the right eye and trace nuclear sclerotic cataracts in both eyes. Dilated ophthalmoscopy and four-mirror gonioscopy show an open angle, normally pigmented trabecular meshwork, and a well-demarcated pigmented brown lesion without extension into the angle. Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) in the right eye is unremarkable and does not show any masses.

Given the patient's history of melanoma and the presence of a pigmented corneal mass, it is important to closely monitor the lesion for any changes or signs of malignancy. Observation with close follow-up is the appropriate next step in management, as it allows for ongoing evaluation of the lesion and early detection of any potential changes or signs of malignancy.

The other options are not appropriate for several reasons:

A. Corneal biopsy: While a corneal biopsy may be considered in some cases of pigmented corneal lesions, it is not necessary in this case given the absence of any signs of malignancy or changes in the lesion. Additionally, corneal biopsy carries risks such as infection, bleeding, and corneal perforation, and may not provide a definitive diagnosis.

B. Surgical excision: Surgical excision may be considered for pigmented corneal lesions that are suspicious for melanoma or have features concerning for malignancy. However, in this case, there are no features suggestive of malignancy, and surgical excision would be premature and potentially unnecessary.

D. Prednisolone 4 times a day in the right eye: Prednisolone is a corticosteroid that may be used to treat inflammation

D. Oral sirolimus is the correct answer because it is a targeted therapy that can effectively treat infantile hemangioma, which is a type of benign vascular tumor. The patient in the case has already undergone embolization and debulking procedures, which have not resulted in complete resolution of the lesion. Oral sirolimus, a mTOR inhibitor, has been shown to be effective in treating infantile hemangioma, particularly in cases where other treatments have failed. It works by inhibiting the mTOR pathway, which is activated in hemangioma and promotes angiogenesis.

A. Repeated trial of oral prednisolone is not the best option because the patient has already tried this treatment and it was poorly tolerated. Additionally, oral prednisolone can have significant side effects, especially with long-term use.

B. Interventional radiology embolization and debulking are not the best options because the patient has already undergone these procedures and they were not effective in resolving the lesion completely.

C. Pulsed dye laser therapy is not the best option because it is primarily used for treating superficial vascular malformations, such as port-wine stains. It is not effective for treating deeper vascular lesions, such as infantile hemangioma.

Therefore, D. Oral sirolimus is the best option for treating this patient's persistent vascular lesion.

**Answer**:A. Intravascular anaplastic large cell lymphoma

The correct diagnosis is A. Intravascular anaplastic large cell lymphoma. This is based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and biopsy results.

Intravascular anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that primarily affects the elderly. It is characterized by the infiltration of malignant cells into the blood vessels, leading to the formation of irregular, pleomorphic nuclei. The tumor cells are positive for CD3 and negative for CD20, AE1/AE3, CK20, chromogranin A, and melan-A, which is consistent with the immunohistochemical stain results described in the case.

The patient's symptoms, including a 2-year history of asymptomatic erythematous-infiltrated patches and plaques on the scalp and face, are consistent with the indolent course of intravascular anaplastic large cell lymphoma. The physical examination findings, including ill-defined, indurated erythematous-violaceous patches, nodules, and plaques involving the surface of the head and face with sporadic erosion and brownish crusts, are also consistent with this diagnosis.

The biopsy results showed sheets of medium to large mononuclear cells infiltrated in the dermis, some of which filled and expanded apparent dermal blood vessels and had large, irregular, pleomorphic nuclei. This is consistent with the infiltration of malignant cells into the blood vessels, which is a hallmark of intravascular anaplastic large cell lymphoma. The Ki-67 labeling index of 70% suggests a high proliferative rate, which is also consistent with this diagnosis.

In contrast, large B-cell lymphoma (choice B) typically affects the lymph nodes and presents with symptoms such as fever, fatigue, and weight loss. Metastatic carcinoma (choice C) would not explain the patient's symptoms or physical exam

The correct answer is C. Lepromatous leprosy.

Lepromatous leprosy is a form of leprosy that is characterized by the presence of diffuse skin lesions, nodules, and plaques, as well as involvement of the mucous membranes, eyes, and peripheral nerves. The patient's symptoms of severe nasal congestion, diffuse skin plaques with erythema, and hypopigmentation are consistent with lepromatous leprosy. The presence of an inverted V deformity of the nasal septum and compromise of the keystone junction also suggest this diagnosis.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Sarcoidosis: Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous disease that can affect various organs, including the skin and lungs. However, it is not typically associated with diffuse skin lesions or hypopigmentation, and the patient's symptoms of severe nasal congestion and inverted V deformity of the nasal septum are not typical of sarcoidosis.

B. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a systemic vasculitis that can affect various organs, including the skin, lungs, and kidneys. However, it is not typically associated with diffuse skin lesions or hypopigmentation, and the patient's symptoms of severe nasal congestion and inverted V deformity of the nasal septum are not typical of granulomatosis with polyangiitis.

D. Progression of mycosis fungoides: Mycosis fungoides is a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that can progress to involve other organs, including the lungs and nervous system. However, the patient's symptoms of severe nasal congestion and inverted V deformity of the nasal septum are not typical of mycosis fungoides, and the presence of diffuse skin plaques with erythema and hypopigmentation suggests a different diagnosis.

**Answer**:B. Coccidioidomycosis

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, along with the results of the flexible transnasal videolaryngoscopy and laryngeous biopsy, are consistent with a diagnosis of Coccidioidomycosis. This fungal infection, also known as valley fever, is endemic in the southwestern United States, including California and Texas, where the patient has traveled. The patient's history of exposure to dust and soil, as well as her symptoms of persistent postnasal drip, pharyngitis, odynophagia, cervicalgia, and cervical lymphadenopathy, are all consistent with Coccidioidomycosis. The patient's elevated eosinophil count and positive Epstein-Barr immunoglobulin G also support this diagnosis.

Squamous cell carcinoma (choice A) is unlikely given the patient's age and lack of significant exposure to carcinogens. While squamous cell carcinoma can occur in the larynx, it is more common in older patients with a history of smoking or other carcinogen exposure.

Tuberculosis (choice C) is also unlikely given the patient's lack of exposure to tuberculosis and the absence of other symptoms such as cough, fever, and weight loss. While tuberculosis can affect the larynx, it is more common in the lung and typically presents with different symptoms.

Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (choice D) is a rare condition that is caused by human papillomavirus and typically affects the larynx and respiratory tract. While it can present with symptoms similar to those of the patient, such as postnasal drip and hoarseness, it is usually seen in children and young adults. The patient's history and physical examination findings do not support this diagnosis.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, laboratory results, and travel history, the most likely diagnosis is Coccidioidomycosis.

The patient's symptoms of progressive hoarseness and dyspnea, along with the physical examination findings of stridulous and hoarse voice, neck examination being unremarkable, and the CT scan of the neck showing irregularity along the free edges of the true vocal folds, are consistent with Blastomycosis. Blastomycosis is a fungal infection that can affect the larynx and cause vocal cord paralysis, which can result in hoarseness and dyspnea. The patient's history of asthma and treatment with inhaled steroids without improvement in symptoms also supports this diagnosis.

The videostroboscopy findings of severe laryngeal mucosal edema, most significant in the false vocal folds, interarytenoid, and postcricoid regions, and the absence of a mucosal wave, are also consistent with Blastomycosis. The irregularity along the free edges of the true vocal folds seen on the CT scan is also consistent with this diagnosis.

The biopsy findings of edematous, irregular, friable laryngeal mucosa with significant airway narrowing, as well as the histopathological findings shown in Figure 1B and 1C, which reveal fungal organisms and inflammation, further support the diagnosis of Blastomycosis.

Sarcoidosis (choice A) is a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Sarcoidosis can cause hoarseness and dyspnea, but it is more likely to cause a chronic cough and shortness of breath. The absence of any history of dysphagia, odynophagia, fevers, unintentional weight loss, or reflux symptoms also makes Sarcoidosis less likely.

Squamous cell cancer (choice C) is unlikely given the patient's age and the absence of any history of smoking, head and neck surgeries, or radiation exposure. Squamous cell cancer is more common in older patients with a longer history of smoking and exposure to carcinogens.

**Answer**: C. Farber disease (disseminated lipogranuloma)

Farber disease, also known as Farber lipogranulomatosis, is a rare genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid ceramidase. This enzyme is essential for the breakdown of lipids, specifically ceramides, in the lysosomes. When the enzyme is deficient, there is an accumulation of ceramides in various tissues, leading to the formation of lipogranulomas, which are characteristic of Farber disease.

The clinical presentation of Farber disease varies, but it often includes skin-colored or yellowish subcutaneous nodules, which can appear anywhere on the body, including the face, trunk, and extremities. The nodules are typically firm and painless, and they can range in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters. Other features of Farber disease can include joint contractures, limitation of joint mobility, and delayed motor development.

In the case described in the question, the patient presented with multiple skin-colored subcutaneous nodules that developed 40 days after birth. The nodules were firm and painless, and they were located on the face, trunk, and extremities, with distal interphalangeal joint deformity of both hands. The patient also had decreased oral intake, decreased activity, and delayed motor development. These findings are consistent with the clinical presentation of Farber disease.

The histopathological findings also support the diagnosis of Farber disease. The presence of a granulomatous pattern, numerous foamy cells, marked collagen degeneration, and mucin deposition (hematoxylin-eosin stain) are all consistent with the histopathological features of Farber disease. Additionally, the presence of comma-shaped curvilinear tubular structures (yellow arrowhead) in the histopathological image is a characteristic feature of Farber disease.

**Answer**: C. Keloidal scleroderma

Keloidal scleroderma is a rare variant of systemic sclerosis, a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the skin and internal organs. It is characterized by the formation of firm, red-brown plaques on the skin, without overlying scale, which is consistent with the clinical findings described in the case. The plaques are typically nodular and may be distributed on the trunk, arms, and legs.

The patient's history of systemic sclerosis and the presence of anti-RNA polymerase III antibody support the diagnosis of keloidal scleroderma. The patient's age and the presence of scleroderma kidney crisis, heart failure, interstitial lung disease, sclerodactyly, and Raynaud phenomenon also align with the disease's typical presentation.

The other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms:

A. Sarcoidosis: Sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect various organs, including the skin. However, the skin lesions in sarcoidosis are typically smaller and more numerous than those described in the case, and may have a more papular or nodular appearance. Additionally, sarcoidosis is not typically associated with systemic sclerosis or anti-RNA polymerase III antibody.

B. Lobomycosis: Lobomycosis is a rare fungal infection that can cause skin lesions. However, the lesions in lobomycosis are typically larger and more irregular in shape than those described in the case, and may have a more waxy or fungating appearance. Additionally, lobomycosis is not typically associated with systemic sclerosis or anti-RNA polymerase III antibody.

The patient's symptoms of headache, jaw pain, and difficulty chewing are also consistent with giant cell arteritis. Additionally, the patient's elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level support the diagnosis.

**Answer**:B. Anti–transfer RNA synthetase myositis is an incorrect choice because it is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the muscles and does not typically cause diplopia or ptosis. While it can cause muscle weakness and pain, it does not explain the patient's ocular symptoms.

While it can cause ocular symptoms such as orbital inflammation and proptosis, it does not typically cause diplopia or ptosis.

**Answer**:D. Myasthenia gravis is an incorrect choice because it is an autoimmune disorder that affects the neuromuscular junction, leading to muscle weakness and fatigue. While it can cause diplopia and ptosis, the patient's symptoms of headache, jaw pain, and difficulty chewing are not typical of myasthenia gravis. Additionally, the patient's normal pupillary reaction and lack of fatigue with eye movements suggest that myasthenia gravis is unlikely.

**Answer**: D. Obtain serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation test

The patient's symptoms and findings, such as persistent subretinal fluid and enlarging pigment epithelial detachments in both eyes, suggest a possible diagnosis of bilateral refractory neurosensory retinal and pigment epithelial detachments. The patient's history of presumed exudative age-related macular degeneration and central serous chorioretinopathy also supports this diagnosis.

The correct answer, D. Obtain serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation test, is the most appropriate next step in the patient's management. This test can help identify potential causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a systemic disease or a genetic disorder, that may be contributing to the development of the retinal detachments.

In contrast, the other answer choices are not as relevant to the patient's current condition and management:

A. Continue intravitreal anti-VEGF injections: While anti-VEGF injections may be effective in treating some cases of age-related macular degeneration, they are not likely to address the underlying cause of the patient's bilateral refractory neurosensory retinal and pigment epithelial detachments.

B. Start photodynamic therapy: Photodynamic therapy is typically used to treat cases of age-related macular degeneration that are caused by choroidal neovascularization. It is not likely to be effective in treating the patient's current condition.

C. Perform an electrooculogram and molecular genetic testing: An electrooculogram may be useful in diagnosing certain retinal disorders, but it is not likely to provide valuable information in this case. Molecular genetic testing may be useful in identifying genetic disorders that contribute to the development of retinal detachments, but it is not the most appropriate next step in the patient's management at this time.

**Answer**:B. Genetic testing

The patient's symptoms, including progressive vision loss, nyctalopia, and cognitive impairments, suggest a possible genetic cause. The family history of unilateral vision loss in the patient's paternal grandmother in her late 20s also supports this possibility. Genetic testing can help identify potential genetic causes of the patient's symptoms, such as retinal dystrophy or other inherited eye disorders.

Option A, electroretinogram, is not the most appropriate next step in this case. While an electroretinogram can provide valuable information about the function of the retina, it is not likely to identify a genetic cause of the patient's symptoms.

Option C, observation, is not a sufficient next step in this case. Given the patient's symptoms and family history, it is important to actively investigate the underlying cause of her vision loss. Observation alone is unlikely to provide a diagnosis or guide management.

Option D, muscle biopsy, is not relevant to this case. The patient's symptoms are primarily related to her vision, and there is no indication of a muscle disorder. A muscle biopsy would not provide useful information in this case.

**Answer**: A. Eosinophilic sialodochitis

The correct diagnosis is eosinophilic sialodochitis, which is a rare inflammatory condition affecting the salivary glands. The patient's symptoms of recurrent and recalcitrant salivary gland swelling, predominantly in the right preauricular and left submandibular regions, are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's history of pruritus and swelling, which were moderate but occasionally severe, and the absence of any environmental or dietary triggers, also support this diagnosis.

The patient's workup, including immune serology and total immunoglobulin (Ig) E measurements, were within normal limits, which rules out other possible causes of salivary gland swelling, such as Sjogren syndrome (choice B). A differential blood cell count revealed 10% eosinophils, which is abnormal, and an absolute eosinophil count of 500/µL, which is also consistent with eosinophilic sialodochitis.

Sialendoscopy of her right parotid and left submandibular glands found no obstructing stones or strictures, which suggests that the swelling is not caused by sialolithiasis (choice C). An open biopsy of the right parotid tail revealed nonspecific inflammatory changes and otherwise normal parenchyma, which is consistent with eosinophilic sialodochitis.

The patient's decision to undergo a right superficial parotidectomy and the subsequent histologic examination of the surgical specimen, which revealed substantial periductal inflammatory infiltrate with eosinophils, further supports the diagnosis of eosinophilic sialodochitis.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, workup, and surgical findings, the most likely diagnosis is eosinophilic sialodochitis, which is choice A.

It is a cystic structure that forms in the neck and thorax and contains respiratory, gastrointestinal, or thyroid tissue. The cyst is lined with respiratory epithelium and may contain hair follicles, sweat glands, and salivary glands.

The patient's symptoms and imaging results are consistent with a foregut duplication cyst. The cyst's location in the left submandibular region, its avascular nature, and the presence of internal debris and a thin septation are all consistent with a foregut duplication cyst. The fact that the cyst elevated the submandibular gland to the level of the parapharyngeal fat space and extended medially into the tongue musculature also supports this diagnosis.

The other options are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and imaging results:

B. Branchial cleft cyst: A branchial cleft cyst is a developmental anomaly that occurs when the branchial apparatus, which forms the thyroid and parathyroid glands, fails to properly close during embryonic development. It typically presents as a neck mass in children and can be unilateral or bilateral. While the location of the cyst in the left submandibular region may be consistent with a branchial cleft cyst, the absence of any skin changes or enlargement of the mass, as well as the cyst's avascular nature and internal debris, argue against this diagnosis.

C. Plunging ranula: A plunging ranula is a type of congenital cystic lesion that extends from the floor of the mouth to the neck. It is usually located in the submandibular region and contains a mixture of mucous and serous fluids. While the location of the cyst in the left submandibular region may be consistent with a plunging ranula, the absence of any skin changes or enlargement of the mass, as well

**Answer**:A. Poikilodermatous plaque–like hemangioma

The correct answer is A, Poikilodermatous plaque–like hemangioma, for the following reasons:

A. Poikilodermatous plaque–like hemangioma:
This diagnosis is correct because the clinical image (Figure, A) shows an ill-defined, erythematous-violaceous plaque with an atrophic appearance, which is consistent with the characteristic features of poikilodermatous plaque–like hemangioma. The histopathology examination (Figure, B-D) also supports this diagnosis, as it reveals band-like vascular proliferation in the upper dermis with no grenz zone, round vascular channels lined by a single layer of endothelial cells without atypia, and CD34 immunostaining that labels endothelial cells. These features are all consistent with the histopathological characteristics of poikilodermatous plaque–like hemangioma.

B. Acquired elastotic hemangioma:
This diagnosis is incorrect because acquired elastotic hemangioma typically presents as a small, solitary, firm nodule or plaque on the skin, often with a yellowish or reddish discoloration. The clinical image (Figure, A) does not show these characteristics, as the plaque is ill-defined and has an atrophic appearance. Additionally, the histopathology examination (Figure, B-D) does not support this diagnosis, as it does not show the characteristic features of acquired elastotic hemangioma, such as abundant elastic fibers and a lack of atypia.

C. Microvenular hemangioma:
This diagnosis is incorrect because microvenular hemangioma typically presents as a small, red, or purple papule or nodule with a characteristic "salt and pepper" appearance due to the presence of numerous small blood vessels. The clinical image (Figure, A) does not show these characteristics, as the plaque is ill-defined and has an atrophic appearance. Additionally, the histopathology examination (Figure, B-D

**Answer**: C. Implantable cardioverter defibrillator

The patient's symptoms of recurrent syncope and shaking, along with a family history of sudden cardiac death in a second cousin, suggest a high risk of sudden cardiac death. The patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) does not show any obvious abnormalities, but this does not rule out the possibility of a cardiac arrhythmia.

An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is a device that is implanted in the chest and can detect and correct abnormal heart rhythms. It is the most appropriate choice for this patient because it can provide immediate protection against sudden cardiac death, which is a potentially life-threatening condition.

A 30-day ambulatory event monitor (choice A) may be useful in detecting arrhythmic events, but it may not provide immediate protection against sudden cardiac death. Electrophysiology study (choice B) is an invasive procedure that is used to diagnose and treat various heart rhythm disorders, but it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient's symptoms. Ventricular ablation (choice D) is a procedure that destroys a small area of heart tissue that is causing abnormal heart rhythms, but it is not indicated in this patient's case.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

**Answer**: A. Check blood lead concentration

The patient's symptoms of chronic abdominal pain, anemia, and bluish pigmentation along the gingival margin suggest a possible diagnosis of lead toxicity. Lead can accumulate in the body over time, particularly in the bones and teeth, and can cause a range of symptoms, including abdominal pain, anemia, and neurological problems. The patient's history of cholecystectomy and appendectomy increases the likelihood that the patient has been exposed to lead, as these procedures can release lead from the body.

The patient's blood test results also support this diagnosis, as lead can cause an increase in liver enzymes, such as alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransaminase, and a decrease in hemoglobin, as seen in this patient. The patient's ferritin level is also elevated, which can be a sign of lead toxicity.

Therefore, checking the patient's blood lead concentration is the most appropriate next step in diagnosing and managing the patient's condition. This test can confirm the diagnosis of lead toxicity and guide treatment decisions.

**Answer**: B. Order anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) level

While the patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and anemia could be consistent with a diagnosis of autoimmune hemolytic anemia, the patient's history and physical examination findings do not support this diagnosis. The patient's bluish pigmentation along the gingival margin is not consistent with this diagnosis, and the patient's blood test results do not show evidence of hemolysis. Additionally, the patient's history of cholecystectomy and appendectomy suggests that the patient has been exposed to lead, which can cause similar symptoms.

Therefore, ordering an ANCA level is not the most appropriate next step in diagnosing and managing the patient's condition.

**Answer**:B. Serum vascular endothelial growth factor

The correct answer is B. Serum vascular endothelial growth factor.

The patient's symptoms of bilateral retro-orbital pain, blurred vision, wavy lines in vision, numbness, and tingling in hands and legs, and weakness of dorsiflexors at the ankles bilaterally, as well as toe extensors and everters, suggest a possible diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). IIH is a condition characterized by increased intracranial pressure without an identifiable cause. It is often associated with obesity, as in this patient's case.

Option B, serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is a relevant test to order next because IIH is known to be associated with elevated levels of VEGF. VEGF is a protein that promotes angiogenesis and increases blood vessel permeability. Elevated levels of VEGF in the blood can contribute to the development of edema in the optic disc, as seen in this patient. Measuring VEGF levels can help support the diagnosis of IIH and guide treatment decisions.

Option A, fluorescein angiography, is not the most appropriate next step in this case. While fluorescein angiography can be useful in evaluating the retinal vasculature and identifying potential retinal vascular abnormalities, it is not specific to the diagnosis of IIH.

Option C, repeated lumbar puncture, may be considered in some cases of IIH to monitor for changes in opening pressure or to perform a therapeutic lumbar puncture to reduce intracranial pressure. However, it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a more urgent need for further evaluation and management.

Option D, start acetazolamide, is a treatment option for IIH that can help reduce intracranial pressure. However, it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as the diagnosis of IIH has not been confirmed, and further evaluation is needed before initiating treatment.

**Answer**:C. Biopsy the EOMs

The correct answer is C. Biopsy the EOMs because it is the most appropriate step to establish the diagnosis of thyroid eye disease (TED) in this case. The patient's symptoms, including severe bilateral periorbital swelling, chemosis, ophthalmoplegia, and proptosis, are consistent with TED. The MRI findings of bilateral and symmetric tendon-sparing extraocular muscle enlargement with nodular heterogenous enhancement also support this diagnosis.

Biopsy of the EOMs is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of TED, as it can help to identify the presence of inflammatory cells and fibrosis in the muscles. This information can help to differentiate TED from other potential causes of extraocular muscle enlargement, such as orbital inflammation or tumors.

In contrast, starting intravenous corticosteroids (choice A) may help to reduce inflammation and manage symptoms, but it does not provide a definitive diagnosis. Obtaining positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT) imaging (choice B) may help to identify additional metastases and biopsy sites, but it is not specific to the diagnosis of TED. Coordinating with the primary team for treatment with octreotide (choice D) may also help to manage symptoms, but it is not a diagnostic test.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in this case is to perform a biopsy of the EOMs to establish a definitive diagnosis of TED.

The correct answer is C: Refer to the health department for 4-drug antituberculous treatment.

The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with uveitis, a condition characterized by inflammation in the eye. The patient's history of recent Nd:YAG capsulotomy and the presence of vitritis suggest that the uveitis is likely caused by an inflammatory response to the surgery. The patient's positive interferon-gamma release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis suggests that the uveitis may be caused by a tuberculous infection.

Referring the patient to the health department for 4-drug antituberculous treatment is the appropriate next step in management. This will allow for further evaluation and treatment of the potential tuberculous infection, which may be contributing to the patient's uveitis.

The other answer choices are not appropriate for the following reasons:

A: Reassure patient and observe this self-limited condition - This approach is not appropriate because the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a more serious underlying condition that requires further evaluation and treatment.

B: Initiate systemic steroids before starting immunosuppression - While systemic steroids may be considered as a treatment option for uveitis, they should not be initiated before a definitive diagnosis has been made. In addition, immunosuppression may not be necessary in this case if the uveitis is caused by a tuberculous infection.

D: Order magnetic resonance imaging of the brain with contrast and perform lumbar puncture - While imaging studies may be considered to evaluate the patient's symptoms, there is no indication for magnetic resonance imaging of the brain with contrast and lumbar puncture at this time. The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with uveitis, and further evaluation and treatment of the potential tuberculous infection should be pursued first.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: Refer to the health department for 4-drug antituberculous treatment.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is C: Perform YAG capsulotomy.

A: Treat with pilocarpine eye drops
Pilocarpine eye drops are used to treat glaucoma by reducing the pressure in the eye. However, in this case, the patient's symptoms of visual deterioration and elevated intraocular pressure are not consistent with primary open-angle glaucoma, which is the indication for pilocarpine eye drops. Additionally, the patient has already been using local antiglaucoma therapy with a fixed-combination prostaglandin and β-blocker, which suggests that the patient's glaucoma is already being treated. Therefore, option A is not the best choice.

B: Schedule for glaucoma surgery
Glaucoma surgery may be necessary in cases where medical therapy is not effective in controlling intraocular pressure. However, in this case, the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest that the issue is not related to glaucoma. The patient's visual deterioration and elevated intraocular pressure are more consistent with a posterior capsular opacification, which can occur after cataract surgery. Therefore, option B is not the best choice.

D: Perform pars plana vitrectomy with removal of intraocular lens and capsular bag plus intravitreal antibiotics
Pars plana vitrectomy is a surgical procedure that involves removing the vitreous gel and any associated opacities. While this procedure may be necessary in some cases, it is not the best choice in this scenario. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest that the issue is related to a posterior capsular opacification, which can be treated with a less invasive procedure such as YAG capsulotomy. Additionally, removing the intraocular lens and capsular bag may not be necessary in this case, as the patient's cataract surgery was uneventful and the lens is in place. Therefore, option D is not the best choice.

**Answer**:B. Obtain information about the immunotherapy protocol initiated for her sarcoma

The correct answer is B. Obtain information about the immunotherapy protocol initiated for her sarcoma. The patient's sudden-onset monocular blurry vision in her right eye, along with the findings of segmental areas of venous sheathing, hyperreflective changes in the outer plexiform and outer nuclear layers, small intraretinal cysts, and disruption of the ellipsoid and interdigitation zone on optical coherence tomography (OCT), are consistent with a diagnosis of immune-related adverse event (irAE) associated with her immunotherapy for sarcoma.

Option A, Recommend cessation of intravenous corticosteroids, is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and OCT findings are not consistent with a diagnosis of corticosteroid-related adverse event.

Option C, Obtain information on prior radiation therapy, is incorrect because the patient's history of radiation therapy for her left orbit clear cell sarcoma is not directly related to her current symptoms and OCT findings.

Option D, Close observation, is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and OCT findings require a more active management approach, such as obtaining information about the immunotherapy protocol and considering possible immune-related adverse events.

Therefore, the best answer is B, Obtain information about the immunotherapy protocol initiated for her sarcoma, as it is the most appropriate step in managing the patient's symptoms and finding the underlying cause of her sudden-onset monocular blurry vision.

**Answer**:B. Multicentric Castleman disease

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results, as well as the imaging findings, are consistent with a diagnosis of multicentric Castleman disease. The patient's history of cervical lymphadenopathy on magnetic resonance imaging, as well as the presence of bilateral cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymphadenopathy, are consistent with the multicentric nature of the disease. The laboratory results show elevated levels of interleukin (IL) 10, IL-6, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which are consistent with the inflammatory nature of the disease. The imaging findings, including the extensive cervical, supraclavicular, retroperitoneal, pelvic, and inguinal lymphadenopathy, with extensive inflammation and fat stranding adjacent to these enlarged nodes, are also consistent with multicentric Castleman disease.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Extrapulmonary tuberculosis: While tuberculosis can cause lymphadenopathy, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not suggest a diagnosis of tuberculosis. The patient does not have a history of travel to an area where tuberculosis is endemic, and there is no evidence of pulmonary involvement. Additionally, the imaging findings do not suggest a diagnosis of tuberculosis.

C. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma: While Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can cause lymphadenopathy, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not suggest a diagnosis of lymphoma. The patient does not have a history of weight loss, fever, or night sweats, which are common symptoms of lymphoma. Additionally, the imaging findings do not suggest a diagnosis of lymphoma.

D. Sarcoidosis: While sarcoidosis can cause lymphadenopathy, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not suggest a diagnosis of sarcoidosis. The patient does

The correct answer is D. Primary cutaneous embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma, because it matches the given case's symptoms and laboratory results.

A. Superficial lymphatic malformation does not match the given case's symptoms and laboratory results. Although it can present with skin lesions, it typically involves the lymphatic system and is not associated with the characteristic histopathological features of rhabdomyosarcoma.

B. Primary superficial Ewing sarcoma is a rare variant of Ewing sarcoma that arises in the soft tissue of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. However, it typically presents with a painless, slowly growing mass, and the histopathological features are different from those of rhabdomyosarcoma.

C. Lymphoblastic lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the immune system and can present with skin lesions. However, it typically involves the lymph nodes and other lymphoid tissues, and the histopathological features are different from those of rhabdomyosarcoma.

D. Primary cutaneous embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma is a rare type of cancer that originates in the skin and has a characteristic histopathological appearance, as seen in the given case. It typically presents with a slowly growing, painless mass, and can have a verrucous surface, as seen in the given case. The histopathological features, such as papillomatous epidermal hyperplasia, edema of dermal papillae, and neoplastic infiltration consisting of small round blue cells with alternating areas of dense and loose cellularity, are consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the tumor cells are positive for MyoD1, which is a marker of rhabdomyosarcoma. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.

**Answer**:B. Epstein-Barr virus–positive mucocutaneous ulcers

The patient's symptoms, including pancytopenia, septic shock, and oral and perianal ulcers, suggest a diagnosis of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)–positive mucocutaneous ulcers. EBV is a common cause of infectious mononucleosis, which can lead to mucocutaneous ulcers. The patient's history of poorly controlled HIV and recent treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics and fluconazole suggest that the ulcers are not caused by herpes simplex virus (choice A) or fungal infection (choice D). The patient's age and history of poorly controlled HIV also make Crohn disease (choice C) less likely. The patient's history of recurrent oral and perianal ulcers, along with the biopsy results showing a mixed infiltrate of histiocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and eosinophils, with prominent admixed large and atypical cells, support the diagnosis of EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcers. The positive EBV-encoded RNA staining result further supports this diagnosis. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Epstein-Barr virus–positive mucocutaneous ulcers.

**Answer**: C. Pituitary apoplexy

Pituitary apoplexy is a medical emergency that occurs when there is sudden swelling or hemorrhage in the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland is located in the sella turcica, a bony cavity at the base of the skull, and plays a critical role in regulating various bodily functions, including vision, hormone production, and blood pressure.

In this case, the patient presented with sudden onset of bilateral complete ophthalmoplegia, which is a hallmark symptom of pituitary apoplexy. The patient also experienced headache, facial numbness, and inability to move both eyes in any direction, which are all consistent with pituitary apoplexy.

The MRI scan showed a large sellar/parasellar mass with homogenous enhancement before symptom onset, which suggests a pituitary adenoma. The mass caused superior displacement of the optic chiasm and had extension into the cavernous sinus bilaterally, which is consistent with pituitary apoplexy. The loss of enhancement on the MRI scan after symptom onset further supports the diagnosis of pituitary apoplexy.

The other answer choices are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and MRI findings. Orbital compartment syndrome (choice A) is a condition where the pressure within the orbit increases, leading to damage to the optic nerve and ophthalmoplegia. However, this condition typically presents with unilateral symptoms, and the patient's bilateral ophthalmoplegia and MRI findings do not support this diagnosis.

Ocular motor apraxia (choice B) is a condition where there is a loss of voluntary eye movements. However, the patient's inability to move both eyes in any direction is not consistent with ocular motor apraxia, as this condition typically presents with a lack of initiative to move the eyes, rather than a complete inability to move them.

Cavernous sinus thrombosis (choice D) is a condition where a blood clot forms in

**Answer**: D. Order testing for hepatitis delta virus (HDV) IgM and IgG antibodies and, if positive, test for HDV RNA

The correct answer is D because the patient's history of intravenous heroin use and chronic inactive hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection with a low serum HBV DNA value, normal liver enzyme values, and no evidence of cirrhosis suggests a high likelihood of exposure to hepatitis delta virus (HDV). HDV is a defective virus that requires the presence of HBV to replicate and is known to cause acute and chronic liver disease in individuals with HBV infection. The patient's symptoms of painless jaundice and malaise, as well as the absence of other causes of liver disease, support the diagnosis of HDV infection.

Testing for HDV IgM and IgG antibodies can help confirm the diagnosis, and if positive, testing for HDV RNA can help determine the severity of the infection. It is important to note that HDV infection can have a fulminant course and may require prompt treatment.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Check plasma HIV-1 RNA level: While HIV co-infection with HBV is not uncommon, the patient's history of intravenous heroin use and the absence of any evidence of HIV infection suggest that HIV is unlikely to be the cause of her symptoms.

B. Order testing for hepatitis E virus IgM antibody: Hepatitis E virus (HEV) is a waterborne virus that is not associated with intravenous drug use. The patient's symptoms and history do not suggest HEV infection.

C. Order testing for anti–smooth muscle antibody: Anti-smooth muscle antibodies (ASMA) are commonly used to diagnose autoimmune hepatitis, which is not suggested by the patient's history or symptoms.

Therefore, the best answer is D. Order testing for hepatitis delta virus (HDV) IgM and IgG antibodies and, if positive, test for HD

The correct answer is C. Prescribe prednisone, 0.25 to 1 mg/kg orally daily, as it is the most appropriate treatment option for the patient's symptoms.

A. Perform chest radiography and pulmonary function testing (PFT) may be necessary to rule out other respiratory conditions, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, given the patient's history of recurrent eye and ear pain.

B. Perform a biopsy of the left ear may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as the patient's symptoms are suggestive of a systemic condition, rather than a localized ear infection.

D. Prescribe ibuprofen, 800 mg 3 times daily may help alleviate the patient's pain and inflammation, but it is not the most appropriate treatment option for the patient's underlying condition.

The patient's symptoms, including recurrent eye and ear pain, cough, weight loss, and elevated ESR and CRP, suggest a systemic inflammatory condition, such as sarcoidosis or vasculitis. Prednisone, a corticosteroid, is a common treatment for these conditions, as it can help reduce inflammation and prevent further organ damage. The dosage of 0.25 to 1 mg/kg orally daily is a typical starting dose for prednisone, and it may be adjusted based on the patient's response to treatment.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in this case is to prescribe prednisone, 0.25 to 1 mg/kg orally daily, and closely monitor the patient's response to treatment.

Explanation:

The patient's symptoms of sudden-onset headache, nausea, and binocular vertical diplopia, along with the physical examination findings of minimal limitation in infraduction in the left eye with corresponding left hypertropia, suggest a possible diagnosis of a cranial nerve disorder. The presence of hyperprolactinemia and galactorrhea suggests a possible pituitary tumor, which could be causing the cranial nerve symptoms.

Option C, ordering an urgent computed tomography (CT) scan and CT angiography of the brain, is the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation. This imaging study can help to identify any abnormalities in the pituitary gland or surrounding structures that may be causing the patient's symptoms. The CT angiography can specifically help to evaluate the blood vessels and identify any potential vascular abnormalities that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms.

Option A, checking thyrotropin and thyroid receptor autoantibody levels and ordering orbital imaging, may also be relevant in the patient's evaluation, but it is not the most urgent or appropriate next step. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest a thyroid-related disorder, and orbital imaging may not provide the necessary information to diagnose the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

Option B, ordering acetylcholine receptor antibody level titers, is not relevant to the patient's symptoms or possible diagnosis and would not provide useful information for the patient's care.

Option D, performing an urgent lumbar puncture, may be considered in some cases of sudden-onset headache and diplopia, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's evaluation, given the presence of hyperprolactinemia and the possibility of a pituitary tumor. A lumbar puncture may be considered later in the patient's evaluation, but it should be done after the patient has received appropriate imaging studies.

**Answer**:B. Order ultrasound biomicroscopy

The patient's symptoms and clinical findings suggest a possible diagnosis of unilateral intraocular lens implant subluxation in an adult, which is a rare complication of posterior chamber intraocular lens (PCIOL) placement. The patient's history of remote bilateral juvenile cataracts and the absence of recent ocular trauma or intraocular surgery make it unlikely that the subluxation is caused by trauma or surgical complications. The superonasal area of pigmentation with elevation of the conjunctiva and the inferotemporally subluxed PCIOL in the right eye, along with the patient's complaints of progressive vision loss, are consistent with unilateral intraocular lens implant subluxation.

The correct answer is B. Order ultrasound biomicroscopy. Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) is a non-invasive imaging technique that uses high-frequency sound waves to produce detailed images of the anterior segment of the eye. UBM can help to evaluate the extent of the subluxation and identify any associated complications, such as vitreous prolapse or iris damage. UBM can also help to differentiate between a subluxated PCIOL and other causes of vision loss, such as cataract recurrence or glaucoma.

Option A, Perform intraocular lens suture fixation or exchange, is not the correct answer at this stage of the patient's evaluation. While suture fixation or exchange may ultimately be necessary to treat the subluxation, it is premature to perform this procedure without first obtaining additional diagnostic information.

Option C, Order anterior segment optical coherence tomography, may also be useful in evaluating the patient's condition, but it is not the most appropriate next step. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) can provide high-resolution images of the anterior segment, including the PCIOL and surrounding tissues. However, AS-OCT may not provide the same level of detail as UBM in evaluating the extent of the subluxation and associated complications

**Answer**:B. Check serum vitamin A levels

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of bilateral corneal ulcers, dry and leathery conjunctiva, and eyelash hypertrichosis suggest a possible deficiency in vitamin A. Vitamin A is essential for the health of the cornea and conjunctiva, and deficiency can lead to impaired epithelial function and increased susceptibility to infection. The patient's diet, which consists mainly of cookies, apples, potato chips, and Gatorade, is deficient in vitamin A. Therefore, it is appropriate to check the patient's serum vitamin A levels to confirm the diagnosis of vitamin A deficiency and guide further management.

A. Perform allergy testing and initiate topical steroids:
Allergy testing may be necessary if the patient's symptoms are caused by an allergic reaction, but it is not the most appropriate step in this case, given the patient's history of vitamin A deficiency. Topical steroids may be useful in reducing inflammation, but they will not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

C. Obtain corneal herpes simplex viral cultures:
While herpes simplex virus (HSV) keratitis can cause corneal ulcers, there is no indication of HSV infection in this patient's history or physical examination. The patient's symptoms are more consistent with vitamin A deficiency, and therefore, obtaining corneal HSV cultures is not the most appropriate step.

D. Perform therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty of the right eye:
Penetrating keratoplasty is a surgical procedure that may be necessary in advanced cases of corneal ulceration, but it is not the most appropriate step in this case. The patient's symptoms can be managed medically with vitamin A supplementation, and surgical intervention is not necessary at this time.

**Answer**: B. Pneumolabyrinth

The patient's symptoms of sudden onset and unremitting vertigo, along with aural fullness and subjective hearing loss, are consistent with pneumolabyrinth. Pneumolabyrinth is a condition where air enters the inner ear and causes a pressure change, leading to vertigo and hearing loss. The patient's positive Dix-Hallpike test and rotary nystagmus also support this diagnosis.

The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and test results as well:

A. Superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome: This condition is characterized by a lack of bone covering the superior semicircular canal, leading to vertigo and hearing loss. However, the patient's symptoms of sudden onset and unremitting vertigo, along with aural fullness, do not match the typical presentation of superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome.

C. Labyrinthitis: Labyrinthitis is an inner ear infection that can cause vertigo, hearing loss, and tinnitus. However, the patient's symptoms of sudden onset and unremitting vertigo, along with aural fullness, do not fit the typical presentation of labyrinthitis. Additionally, the patient's negative otoscopic examination and lack of evidence of infection on CT scan make labyrinthitis less likely.

D. Meniere disease: Meniere disease is a disorder of the inner ear that can cause vertigo, hearing loss, tinnitus, and a feeling of fullness in the affected ear. However, the patient's symptoms of sudden onset and unremitting vertigo, along with aural fullness and subjective hearing loss, do not fit the typical presentation of Meniere disease. Additionally, the patient's negative otoscopic examination and lack of evidence of Meniere disease on CT scan make it less likely.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and test results, the most likely diagnosis is pneumolabyrinth.

**Answer**: B. Parathyroid cyst

The patient's symptoms, test results, and surgical findings all point to a parathyroid cyst as the correct diagnosis.

A. Benign thyroid nodule:
A benign thyroid nodule would not explain the patient's symptoms of a slowly progressive painless lateral neck mass on the right side. Additionally, the patient's normal thyroid stimulating hormone and calcium levels, as well as the absence of any solid nodularity or septation on neck ultrasonography, make it unlikely that this is a benign thyroid nodule.

C. Reactive viral lymphadenopathy:
Reactive viral lymphadenopathy would not explain the patient's symptoms of a slowly progressive painless lateral neck mass on the right side. Additionally, the patient's normal thyroid stimulating hormone and calcium levels, as well as the absence of any solid nodularity or septation on neck ultrasonography, make it unlikely that this is a reactive viral lymphadenopathy.

D. Thyroglossal duct cyst:
A thyroglossal duct cyst would not explain the patient's symptoms of a slowly progressive painless lateral neck mass on the right side. Additionally, the patient's normal thyroid stimulating hormone and calcium levels, as well as the absence of any solid nodularity or septation on neck ultrasonography, make it unlikely that this is a thyroglossal duct cyst.

B. Parathyroid cyst:
A parathyroid cyst would explain the patient's symptoms of a slowly progressive painless lateral neck mass on the right side, as well as the patient's normal thyroid stimulating hormone and calcium levels. The presence of a homogenously dim lesion on near-infrared autofluorescence camera and the positive staining for PTH inside the lesion support the diagnosis of a parathyroid cyst. The patient's age and lack of significant medical or family history of thyroid disease also make it more likely that this is a parathyroid cyst.

**Answer**: C. Parotid gland hemorrhage

The correct answer is C. Parotid gland hemorrhage because the patient's symptoms and imaging results are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient presented with sudden-onset right preauricular and upper neck swelling, which suggests a bleeding episode in the parotid gland. The physical examination did not reveal any signs of facial weakness or paralysis, which supports the diagnosis of a hemorrhage rather than a tumor. The patient's history of coronary artery disease and prior myocardial infarction also increases the likelihood of a bleeding disorder.

The contrast-enhanced CT scan showed an ill-defined infiltrative mass centered in the deep lobe of the right parotid gland, which is consistent with a hemorrhage. The follow-up CT scan performed 6 weeks later showed resolution of the hemorrhage, which further supports the diagnosis.

The other answer choices are less likely because:

A. Primary parotid gland cancer: The patient's symptoms and imaging results do not suggest a malignancy. The patient did not have any signs of facial weakness or paralysis, which are common symptoms of parotid gland cancer.

B. Parotid gland lymphoma: Lymphoma is a rare condition that affects the parotid gland, and the patient's symptoms and imaging results do not suggest this diagnosis. The patient did not have any signs of lymphadenopathy or other systemic symptoms that are commonly seen in lymphoma.

D. Benign parotid gland tumor: The patient's symptoms and imaging results do not suggest a benign tumor. The patient had sudden-onset swelling, which is more consistent with a bleeding episode than a slow-growing tumor. Additionally, the patient's history of coronary artery disease and prior myocardial infarction increases the likelihood of a bleeding disorder.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and imaging results, the most likely diagnosis is C. Parotid gland

**Answer**: C. Lipodystrophia centrifugalis abdominalis infantilis

The correct answer is C. Lipodystrophia centrifugalis abdominalis infantilis because it matches the given case's symptoms. Lipodystrophia centrifugalis abdominalis infantilis is a rare condition characterized by the loss of subcutaneous fat tissue in the neck, nape, and submandibular regions. It typically presents in infants and young children, and the exact cause is unknown.

The patient's symptoms, such as progressive skin depressions in the neck, nape, and submandibular regions, with atrophy in the center of the lesion surrounded by an erythematous border and underlying blood vessels, are consistent with this condition. Additionally, the biopsy results showing normal epidermis and dermis, no inflammatory cell infiltration within the dermis, and somewhat diminished subcutaneous fatty tissue support this diagnosis.

Now, let's discuss why the other choices are incorrect:

A. Morphea: Morphea is a localized form of scleroderma characterized by thickening and hardening of the skin. It doesn't match the patient's symptoms, as it doesn't cause atrophy or depression of the skin.

B. Lupus panniculitis: Lupus panniculitis is a rare condition that occurs in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. It is characterized by inflammation of the subcutaneous fat, leading to painful nodules or plaques on the skin. The patient didn't have any signs of systemic lupus erythematosus, and the biopsy results didn't show any inflammatory cell infiltration within the dermis.

D. Subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn: This is a rare condition that occurs in newborns and is caused by trauma during delivery. It presents with firm, yellowish-white nodules or plaques on the skin. The patient's age and medical history don't support this diagnosis, as it typically occurs in newborns.

The correct answer is C. Metastatic carcinoma.

**A. Interstitial granulomatous dermatitis**
Interstitial granulomatous dermatitis is a rare condition characterized by the formation of granulomas in the skin, often in response to a trigger such as an infection or medication. However, the clinical presentation and histopathological findings in this case do not support this diagnosis. The patient's symptoms of abdominal discomfort, weight loss, and vaginal bleeding, as well as the rapid increase in size of a previously palpable mass, suggest a more systemic process. Additionally, the histopathological findings of large atypical cells with clear or eosinophilic cytoplasm forming papillary and glandular architectures are not consistent with interstitial granulomatous dermatitis.

**B. Wolf isotopic response**
Wolf isotopic response is a rare condition characterized by the development of erythematous plaques on the skin in response to isotopic stimulation. However, this diagnosis is unlikely in this case because the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest isotopic stimulation, and the histopathological findings do not support this diagnosis.

**D. Cutaneous endometriosis**
Cutaneous endometriosis is a rare condition in which endometrial tissue implants in the skin, often resulting in the formation of nodules or plaques. However, this diagnosis is unlikely in this case because the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest endometrial involvement, and the histopathological findings do not support this diagnosis.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is C. Metastatic carcinoma. The patient's symptoms of abdominal discomfort, weight loss, and vaginal bleeding, as well as the rapid increase in size of a previously palpable mass, suggest a more systemic process.

**Answer**:C. Autosomal recessive parkinsonism

The patient's symptoms, such as progressive parkinsonism, poor response to levodopa, and the presence of cognitive decline, are consistent with autosomal recessive parkinsonism. Additionally, the patient's family history is negative for movement or developmental disorders, which supports the diagnosis of an autosomal recessive condition.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Progressive supranuclear palsy: This is a rare brain disorder that affects movement, balance, and eye movements. While it can present with parkinsonism, it typically has a slower progression and does not have the same cognitive decline as seen in autosomal recessive parkinsonism.

B. Mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes: This is a rare genetic disorder that affects the brain and nervous system. While it can present with cognitive decline and parkinsonism, it typically has a more rapid progression and additional symptoms such as seizures, stroke-like episodes, and muscle weakness, which are not seen in this patient.

D. Paraneoplastic syndrome: This is a rare condition where the immune system attacks the brain and nervous system in association with a cancer. While it can present with parkinsonism and cognitive decline, it typically has a more rapid progression and additional symptoms such as seizures, vision loss, and cerebellar ataxia, which are not seen in this patient.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and family history, the most likely diagnosis is autosomal recessive parkinsonism.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is B: Perform a bone marrow biopsy with flow cytometry and cytogenetics.

A: Obtain blood cultures and start intravenous vancomycin.

This choice is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not suggest a bacterial infection. The patient's history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, along with the physical examination findings of tender, nonfluctuant plaques on the scalp and hands, suggest a different diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's blood work does not show any signs of bacterial infection, such as an elevated white blood cell count or C-reactive protein level.

C: Perform incision and drainage of the skin lesions.

This choice is incorrect because the skin lesions are not likely to be caused by an abscess or other bacterial infection that would require incision and drainage. The patient's history and physical examination suggest a different diagnosis, and the skin lesions are more likely to be a manifestation of that underlying condition.

D: Prescribe oral dapsone.

This choice is incorrect because dapsone is not typically used to treat the patient's suspected underlying condition. Dapsone is an antibiotic that is used to treat conditions such as leprosy, dermatitis herpetiformis, and some types of skin infections. While it may be considered in the differential diagnosis for certain skin conditions, it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

In contrast, a bone marrow biopsy with flow cytometry and cytogenetics would be a more appropriate diagnostic test for this patient. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, night sweats, and weight loss, along with the physical examination findings of tender, nonfluctuant plaques on the scalp and hands, suggest a possible diagnosis of a hematologic malignancy, such as cutaneous lymphoma. A bone marrow biopsy would allow for the evaluation of the bone marrow tissue and would be able to detect any abnormal cells that may be present. Flow cytometry

**Answer**: C. Prescribe a nonsedating antihistamine at a standard dose and increase to high-dose antihistamine if symptoms persist.

The correct answer is C because the patient's symptoms of urticaria and angioedema are consistent with an allergic reaction to the COVID-19 mRNA booster vaccine. A nonsedating antihistamine is a reasonable first-line treatment for mild to moderate allergic reactions, and increasing the dose if symptoms persist is a appropriate step to take.

Now, let's discuss why the other choices are incorrect:

A. Advise the patient against future COVID-19 mRNA vaccination because of allergy: While it's possible that the patient may have an allergy to the vaccine, it's not appropriate to advise against future vaccination without further testing and evaluation. The patient may be able to receive future vaccinations with proper precautions and monitoring.

B. Prescribe a preloaded epinephrine autoinjector and refer for allergy testing: While a preloaded epinephrine autoinjector may be appropriate for patients with severe allergic reactions, it's not the first-line treatment for mild to moderate allergic reactions like the patient's. Additionally, referring for allergy testing without first attempting to treat the patient's symptoms is not the most appropriate course of action.

D. Prescribe oral prednisone (60 mg per day for 5 days): Oral prednisone may be used to treat severe allergic reactions, but it's not a first-line treatment for mild to moderate reactions like the patient's. Additionally, a 5-day course of prednisone may not be sufficient to treat the patient's symptoms, and it may be associated with side effects.

In summary, choice C is the most appropriate answer because it provides a reasonable and safe first-line treatment for the patient's symptoms, while allowing for dose adjustment if necessary.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain why B. Greater auricular nerve neuroma is the correct answer and why the other choices are incorrect.

**Answer**: B. Greater auricular nerve neuroma

The patient's symptoms of intermittent pain in the operative site, associated with a small lump over the left neck, and the pain being worse on touch and head turning, are consistent with a neuroma. A neuroma is a benign growth of nerve tissue that can occur after surgery or trauma to a nerve. The greater auricular nerve is a sensory nerve that supplies the skin over the parotid gland and the neck. It is possible that during the previous parotidectomy, the nerve was injured or compressed, leading to the development of a neuroma.

The patient's history of a previous left superficial parotidectomy 10 years ago, and the presence of a focus of nodular oncocytic hyperplasia in the adjacent parenchyma and reactive intraparotid lymph nodes, suggest that the patient has a history of benign tumors in the parotid gland. This increases the likelihood that the current symptoms are related to a neuroma, rather than a recurrent parotid tumor.

The patient's normal facial nerve function and intact sensation in the ear lobe also support the diagnosis of a neuroma, as a recurrent parotid tumor would be more likely to cause facial weakness or numbness.

The MRI scan showing no focal lesion in either parotid glands or at the area of interest over the left sternocleidomastoid muscle, also supports the diagnosis of a neuroma, as it suggests that there is no recurrent tumor in the parotid gland.

The intraoperative photograph of the neck and the excised specimen, which shows a well-circumscribed, nodular lesion in the left lateral neck, is consistent with a neuroma.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, history, physical examination, and imaging studies, the most likely diagnosis is a greater auricular nerve neuroma.

**Answer**: D. Transscleral cyclophotocoagulation and removal of the mass and Ahmed valve

The correct answer is D, Transscleral cyclophotocoagulation and removal of the mass and Ahmed valve, for the following reasons:

A. Bleb revision with excision of the mass (choice A) may be necessary in some cases, but it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient. The patient has a history of multiple previous ocular surgeries, including a scleral buckle and Ahmed valve implantation, and has intractable glaucoma. In this scenario, it is important to address the underlying cause of the mass, which is likely related to the patient's glaucoma and previous surgical interventions. Bleb revision may not address the root cause of the problem and may not be sufficient to improve the patient's vision.

B. Fine-needle aspiration of the mass (choice B) is not recommended as the first line of treatment for several reasons. First, fine-needle aspiration may not be able to remove the entire mass, which is large and firm. Second, the patient has a history of multiple previous ocular surgeries, which may have introduced bacteria into the eye, increasing the risk of infection with fine-needle aspiration. Third, fine-needle aspiration may not provide a definitive diagnosis of the mass, which is important for guiding further management.

C. Silicone oil removal from the vitreous cavity (choice C) may be necessary in some cases, but it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient. The patient's vision loss and subconjunctival mass are likely related to the patient's glaucoma and previous surgical interventions, rather than the silicone oil. Removing the silicone oil without addressing the underlying cause of the mass and vision loss may not improve the patient's outcome.

D. Transscleral cyclophotocoagulation and removal of the mass and Ahmed valve (choice D) is the most appropriate choice for this patient. This approach addresses the underlying cause of the mass and vision loss, which is likely related to the patient's glaucoma and previous

**Answer**:C. Perform bone marrow biopsy

The correct answer is C. Perform bone marrow biopsy, as it is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's condition.

The patient's symptoms of headache, malaise, recent cough, and fever, along with the laboratory findings of anemia, leukopenia, and elevated inflammatory markers, suggest a systemic inflammatory condition. The presence of bilateral disc edema and peripapillary hemorrhage on ophthalmic examination suggests papilledema, which is a sign of increased intracranial pressure. The normal results of the MRI of the brain and orbits, as well as the negative CSF viral serology test results, suggest that the cause of the papilledema is unlikely to be a central nervous system infection or inflammation.

Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms and signs is idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), also known as pseudotumor cerebri. IIH is a condition of unknown cause that is characterized by increased intracranial pressure, papilledema, and often vision loss. The patient's age and lack of other medical conditions make IIH a more likely diagnosis than other potential causes of papilledema, such as a brain tumor or stroke.

Performing a bone marrow biopsy would not be an appropriate next step in the management of this patient's condition, as it would not provide any information relevant to the patient's symptoms or signs. Bone marrow biopsy is typically performed to diagnose and monitor hematological disorders, such as leukemia or lymphoma, but it would not be helpful in diagnosing or managing IIH.

Repeating serial ophthalmic examinations, as choice A suggests, may be useful in monitoring the progression of the patient's papilledema and assessing the response to treatment, but it would not provide a definitive diagnosis or guide management.

Diagnosing and treating idiopathic intracranial hypertension, as choice B suggests, may be appropriate if the patient's symptoms and signs

**Answer**: B. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbit

The patient's symptoms of new-onset fluctuating diplopia and worsening right upper eyelid ptosis, along with the physical examination findings of a small exotropia in primary gaze with a -2 supraduction deficit, suggest a possible diagnosis of a cranial nerve disorder, specifically a fourth nerve palsy. The patient's history of hypertension increases the likelihood of this diagnosis, as hypertension is a common cause of cranial nerve palsies.

Option B, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbit, is the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation. MRI can help to confirm the diagnosis of a fourth nerve palsy by identifying any structural abnormalities in the brain or orbit that may be causing the symptoms. MRI can also help to rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a stroke or a tumor.

Option A, serum testing for autoantibodies, may be appropriate in some cases of cranial nerve palsies, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's evaluation. While autoantibodies have been associated with some cases of cranial nerve palsies, they are not commonly tested for in the initial evaluation of a patient with a fourth nerve palsy.

Option C, revision ptosis repair, is not the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation. While the patient did have a previous ptosis repair, the current symptoms of fluctuating diplopia and worsening ptosis suggest a new or worsening cranial nerve disorder, rather than a problem with the previous repair. Revision ptosis repair may be considered after the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms has been identified and treated.

Option D, beginning symptomatic management with a cholinesterase inhibitor, may be appropriate in some cases of cranial nerve palsies, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's evaluation. While cholinesterase inhibitors can help to improve symptoms of diplop

**Answer**: D. Rule out an occult systemic neoplasm

The correct answer is D. Rule out an occult systemic neoplasm because the patient's symptoms and findings suggest a possible choroidal melanoma, which is a type of eye cancer that can metastasize to other parts of the body. Before proceeding with any treatment for the eye, it is important to rule out the possibility of a systemic neoplasm, or cancer, that may have spread to the eye.

A. Investigate liver dysfunction and biliary tract obstruction is not relevant to the patient's symptoms or findings, and there is no indication of liver or biliary tract disease in the case description.

B. Drain the hemorrhage with scleral windows may be necessary at some point in the patient's treatment, but it is not the next step in managing the patient's care. The patient's symptoms and findings suggest a possible choroidal melanoma, which must be ruled out before proceeding with any surgical intervention.

C. Treat with plaque brachytherapy is not appropriate at this time, as the patient has not been diagnosed with a malignancy, and there is no indication for radiation therapy. Plaque brachytherapy is a treatment for eye cancer, specifically choroidal melanoma, and would not be used to treat a patient without a confirmed diagnosis of cancer.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Rule out an occult systemic neoplasm.

**Answer**:B. Radiation recall myelopathy

The patient's symptoms of progressive bilateral lower extremity numbness, pain, weakness, and imbalance, as well as the MRI findings of extensive spinal cord edema extending from T2 to the conus and a posterior ring-enhancing intramedullary lesion at T9 to T10 without any mass effect, are consistent with radiation recall myelopathy. This is a known complication of radiation therapy, which can occur weeks to months after treatment. The fact that the patient had recently received stereotactic body radiation therapy to T2 to T3 and palliative radiation therapy to T9 to T12, and that the intramedullary lesion appeared atypical for malignant disease given the lack of mass effect, supports this diagnosis.

Option A, metastatic progression, is unlikely given the patient's recent treatment with radiation therapy and the lack of any new metastatic lesions on the PET/CT scan. Proceeding with irradiation would not be appropriate for this patient.

Option C, radiation necrosis, is also a possible complication of radiation therapy, but it typically presents with a different set of symptoms, such as sudden severe back pain, fever, and neurological deficits. Additionally, the MRI findings of extensive spinal cord edema and a posterior ring-enhancing intramedullary lesion are not typical of radiation necrosis. Adding bevacizumab to the patient's treatment plan would not be appropriate for this patient.

Option D, spinal cord infarct, is a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's history of radiation therapy and the lack of any other vascular risk factors. The patient's symptoms and MRI findings are also not typical of a spinal cord infarct. Underlying cause workup and supportive care would be appropriate for this patient, but it would not address the underlying radiation recall myelopathy.

Therefore, the correct answer is B, radiation recall myelopathy, and the patient should continue steroids and discontinue doxorubicin.

**Answer**:A. Encephalocele

The patient's symptoms of headache, jaw pain, paresthesia, and trismus, along with the physical examination findings of bilateral tenderness of the temporomandibular joints and paresthesia of the right trigeminal nerve in the V2 and V3 distribution, suggest a neurological disorder involving the trigeminal nerve. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealing a cystic mass in the right side of infratemporal fossa (ITF) that was nonenhancing on T1 sequencing with contrast and hyperintense on T2, supports the diagnosis of an encephalocele.

Encephalocele is a rare congenital neural tube defect in which the brain or meninges protrude through a defect in the skull. It can occur in various locations, including the infratemporal fossa. The symptoms of encephalocele can vary depending on the location and size of the defect, but often include headache, facial pain or paresthesia, and difficulty swallowing or speaking.

The other choices are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and MRI findings:

B. Deep lobe parotid tumor: A parotid tumor would not explain the patient's symptoms of headache, jaw pain, and paresthesia, nor would it be visible on MRI as a cystic mass in the infratemporal fossa.

C. Trigeminal schwannoma: A trigeminal schwannoma is a benign tumor that arises from the Schwann cells of the trigeminal nerve. While it may cause facial pain or paresthesia, it would not explain the patient's symptoms of headache, jaw pain, or trismus. Additionally, the MRI findings of a cystic mass in the infratemporal fossa would not be consistent with a trigeminal schwannoma.

**Answer**: B. Aquagenic syringeal acrokeratoderma

The correct answer is B. Aquagenic syringeal acrokeratoderma, as it matches the symptoms described in the case. Aquagenic syringeal acrokeratoderma is a rare condition characterized by the development of white or yellowish papules, plaques, or nodules on the palms and soles after exposure to water. The condition is caused by the dilatation of eccrine sweat ducts, leading to the formation of keratinous plugs that obstruct the ducts.

The patient's symptoms of thickening and swelling of hands after immersion in water, accompanied by burning pruritus, and the appearance of symmetrical white and transparent papules, white keratosis, and excessive wrinkling on the dorsum of hands after water immersion, are all consistent with aquagenic syringeal acrokeratoderma. The fact that the lesions worsened in summer and remitted in winter also supports this diagnosis, as water exposure is more common in warmer months.

The histopathological features shown in the figure, such as hyperkeratosis, dilated eccrine ducts in the epidermis and dermis, and hyperplasia of the eccrine sweat gland, are also consistent with aquagenic syringeal acrokeratoderma.

The other answer choices do not match the patient's symptoms or the histopathological features of the condition:

A. Eczema: Eczema is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by dry, itchy, and scaly skin. While eczema can cause skin thickening and wrinkling, it does not typically cause the formation of white or yellowish papules, plaques, or nodules on the palms and soles after exposure to water.

**Answer**: A. Pressure necrosis

The correct answer is A. Pressure necrosis because it is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and medical history. The patient developed erythema and edematous necrotic plaques on their bilateral ears, which is consistent with pressure necrosis. The fact that the necrosis progressed during the following days, primarily involving the earlobe of the right ear and a large portion of the helix of the left ear, further supports this diagnosis.

Pressure necrosis, also known as pressure ulcer or bed sore, is a type of injury that occurs when there is prolonged pressure on the skin, leading to the death of skin cells and underlying tissue. This can happen when a patient is bedridden or immobile for an extended period, as in the case of this patient who was intubated and in the prone position.

The other answer choices are less likely diagnoses for the patient's symptoms.

B. Levamisole-induced vasculitis is a rare side effect of levamisole, a medication used to treat certain parasitic infections. While it can cause skin lesions, it is not typically associated with necrotic plaques on the ears.

C. COVID-19-associated acroischemia (thrombotic vasculopathy) is a rare complication of COVID-19 that affects the small blood vessels in the skin, leading to ischemia and necrosis. However, this condition typically affects the distal extremities, such as the fingers and toes, and is less likely to cause necrotic plaques on the ears.

D. Nonpseudomonal ecthyma gangrenosum is a rare condition that is characterized by the development of necrotic lesions on the skin, typically in association with a bacterial infection. However, the patient's medical history and laboratory results do not suggest the presence of a bacterial infection, making this diagnosis less likely.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, the most likely diagnosis is pressure necrosis.

**Answer**:A. Obtain a chest CT scan and myositis-specific autoantibody panel

The patient's symptoms of digital ulcers, livedo racemosa, and dyspnea on exertion suggest a possible diagnosis of systemic sclerosis (SSc), a connective tissue disease that can affect the skin and internal organs. The presence of crackles on lung auscultation also supports this diagnosis, as SSc can cause interstitial lung disease.

A chest CT scan is necessary to evaluate the extent of lung involvement and to rule out other potential causes of dyspnea, such as lung cancer or pulmonary embolism. A myositis-specific autoantibody panel can help support the diagnosis of SSc, as certain autoantibodies are commonly found in patients with this condition.

Option B, ordering testing for anti–double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody, is not relevant to the patient's symptoms or potential diagnosis. While anti-dsDNA antibodies can be present in SSc, they are not specific to this condition and can be found in other autoimmune disorders.

Option C, ordering testing for anti-scl-70 and anticentromere antibodies, may be appropriate for patients with suspected SSc, but it is not as specific as a myositis-specific autoantibody panel. Anti-scl-70 and anticentromere antibodies are commonly found in patients with SSc, but they can also be present in other conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus.

Option D, performing a muscle biopsy, may be necessary in some cases of suspected SSc to confirm the diagnosis and assess muscle damage, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's evaluation. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a more urgent need for imaging and laboratory testing to evaluate the extent of lung and skin involvement.

**Answer**: D. Start intravenous glucocorticoids

The correct answer is D. Start intravenous glucocorticoids, as the patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis, a severe bacterial infection that can lead to skin and soft tissue necrosis. The patient's fever, hypotension, and worsening necrotic wound are consistent with this diagnosis.

Option A, adding intravenous amphotericin B, is not appropriate as there is no evidence of fungal infection. While amphotericin B is effective against fungal infections, it is not effective against bacterial infections.

Option B, further surgical debridement, may be necessary, but it is not the most appropriate next step. Surgical debridement is a surgical procedure that removes dead tissue, and it may be necessary to remove the necrotic tissue to prevent further spread of the infection. However, the patient's current condition is severe, and surgery may not be feasible at this time.

Option C, starting hyperbaric oxygen therapy, may be beneficial in treating necrotizing fasciitis, but it is not the most appropriate next step. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy increases the amount of oxygen in the blood, which can help to reduce the size of the infected area and promote healing. However, it is not a substitute for antibiotic therapy, and it may not be effective in the absence of appropriate antibiotic treatment.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to start intravenous glucocorticoids, which can help to reduce inflammation and prevent further tissue damage. Glucocorticoids are effective in treating necrotizing fasciitis and can help to improve the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

**Answer**:A. Check antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) titers

The patient's symptoms of joint pain, particularly in the hands and feet, and the presence of a nasal deformity, suggest a possible diagnosis of polyarticular gout. Gout is a type of inflammatory arthritis caused by the deposition of uric acid crystals in the joints. The patient's history of obstructive sleep apnea and use of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) may also be relevant to the patient's overall health and potential treatment plan, but they are not directly related to the likely diagnosis of gout.

The correct answer, A. Check antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) titers, is a relevant diagnostic test for gout. ANCA is a type of autoantibody that is commonly elevated in patients with gout. The presence of ANCA in the blood can help support the diagnosis of gout, although it is not specific to this condition and may also be elevated in other autoimmune disorders.

The other answer choices are not directly related to the likely diagnosis of gout:

B. Check antinuclear antibody (ANA) and complement levels: ANA is an autoantibody that is commonly elevated in patients with autoimmune disorders, but it is not specific to gout. Complement levels may be relevant in some autoimmune disorders, but they are not typically checked in the initial evaluation of gout.

C. Obtain conventional angiography of the aorta and renal arteries: This imaging study is not typically used in the evaluation of gout, as it is a condition that affects the joints rather than the blood vessels.

D. Order rapid plasma reagin (RPR) and fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test: These tests are used to diagnose syphilis, which is a sexually transmitted infection that can cause joint pain. However, the patient's symptoms and history do not suggest a likely diagnosis of syphilis.

**Answer**:B. Change therapies for Crohn disease

The correct answer is B. Change therapies for Crohn disease, as the patient's symptoms are suggestive of an inflammatory process related to the Crohn disease, and changing therapies may help to control the inflammation and prevent further complications.

A. Prescribe long-term prednisone therapy may be considered as a temporary solution to control the inflammation, but it may not address the underlying cause of the problem, which is the Crohn disease. Moreover, long-term use of prednisone can have significant side effects.

C. Perform further imaging to exclude a solid-organ primary malignancy may be necessary in some cases, but it is not the most appropriate step in this scenario, as the patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest an inflammatory process related to Crohn disease rather than a malignancy.

D. Perform further thyroid function tests and thyroid imaging may be necessary if the patient had symptoms or signs suggestive of thyroid dysfunction, but there is no indication of thyroid involvement in this case.

Therefore, the best answer is B. Change therapies for Crohn disease.

**Answer**: C. Genetic testing

The patient's presentation of multifocal macular lesions and mildly decreased visual acuity, along with the absence of any significant medical history or family history of retinal diseases, raises the possibility of a genetic disorder. The patient's age and bilateral involvement also suggest a higher likelihood of a genetic etiology.

Option A, computed tomographic scan of chest, abdomen, and pelvis, is not directly related to the patient's ocular symptoms and is unlikely to provide useful information for the patient's diagnosis or treatment. While it is possible that a systemic disease may be contributing to the patient's retinal findings, a CT scan is not the appropriate imaging modality to evaluate the retina.

Option B, repeat anti-VEGF treatment, may be considered as a treatment option for the patient's current symptoms, but it is not a diagnostic test. The patient has already received anti-VEGF treatment without resolution of the lesions, and it is unclear whether further treatment would be effective.

Option D, antiretinal antibody testing, may be considered in the evaluation of certain retinal diseases, but it is not typically used in the diagnosis of AEPVM. The patient's history and examination findings do not suggest a typical autoimmune retinopathy, and antiretinal antibody testing is unlikely to provide useful information in this case.

Therefore, option C, genetic testing, is the most appropriate choice for this patient. Genetic testing may help identify a potential genetic cause for the patient's multifocal macular lesions and guide further management and counseling.

The correct answer is C. Sclerectomy in the left eye.

A. Repeat LPI in the left eye: This choice is incorrect because the patient has already undergone LPI in the left eye, and it has not resolved the issue. Repeating the procedure may not be effective in this case, and it may even make the situation worse.

B. Perform an LPI in the right eye: This choice is incorrect because the patient's symptoms are occurring in the left eye, and performing LPI in the right eye would not address the underlying issue.

D. Perform a clear lens exchange in the left eye: This choice is incorrect because the patient's symptoms are not caused by a cataract or lens issue. A clear lens exchange would not address the underlying cause of the subretinal fluid and choroidal effusions.

C. Sclerectomy in the left eye: This choice is correct because it addresses the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, which is the shallow anterior chamber and open angle in the left eye. Sclerectomy is a surgical procedure that involves removing a portion of the sclera to deepen the anterior chamber and allow for better drainage of aqueous humor. This can help to resolve the subretinal fluid and choroidal effusions.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Sclerectomy in the left eye.

**Answer**:C. Perform ciliary body–choroidal biopsy in the right eye

Explanation:

A. Perform a diagnostic vitrectomy in the right eye: A diagnostic vitrectomy may be considered to obtain a tissue sample for further evaluation, but it is not the most appropriate choice in this case. The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome, a lymphoproliferative disorder that can cause inflammation in various parts of the eye. A diagnostic vitrectomy may not provide sufficient tissue to establish a definitive diagnosis, and it may not be necessary given the patient's symptoms and examination findings.

B. Inject intravitreal antibiotics for endophthalmitis in both eyes: Endophthalmitis is an infection within the eye, typically caused by bacteria or fungi. While the patient's symptoms of rapid, painless vision loss and multilobulated, serous retinal detachment may be consistent with endophthalmitis, the absence of any signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, or discharge, makes it less likely. Additionally, the patient's history of autoimmune pancreatitis and the imaging findings of diffuse choroidal and ciliary body thickening, multifocal pockets of subretinal fluid, and speckled hyperautofluorescence and hypoautofluorescence suggest a more chronic inflammatory condition. Injecting intravitreal antibiotics may not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

D. Treat the patient with systemic steroids for presumed VKH syndrome: While systemic steroids may be a treatment option for VKH syndrome, they should be used with caution in this case. The patient's history of autoimmune pancreatitis and the imaging findings of diffuse choroidal and ciliary body thickening, multifocal pockets of subretinal fluid, and speckled hyperautofluorescence and hypoautofluorescence suggest a more complex underlying condition that may not respond well

D: Crohn disease

The patient's symptoms, including bilateral linear oral ulcerations, facial swelling, and a history of depression, alcohol use disorder, and daily electronic cigarette use, are consistent with Crohn disease. The presence of noncaseating granulomatous inflammation on the biopsy specimen also supports this diagnosis.

A: Mumps (epidemic parotitis) is an infectious disease that can cause swelling of the salivary glands, but it typically does not cause oral ulcerations or granulomatous inflammation.

B: Alcoholic sialosis is a condition that can cause bilateral swelling of the salivary glands, but it is not typically associated with oral ulcerations or granulomatous inflammation.

C: Sjogren disease is an autoimmune disorder that can cause dry mouth and oral ulcerations, but it typically does not cause facial swelling or granulomatous inflammation.

Therefore, D: Crohn disease is the most likely diagnosis for this patient's symptoms.

The correct answer is **B**: Metastatic colon cancer.

The patient's symptoms of hoarseness and intermittent dry cough, along with the physical examination findings of left vocal cord palsy in the paramedian position, suggest a problem with the recurrent laryngeal nerve. The CT scan shows an ill-defined soft tissue mass in the left supraclavicular region, which is likely nodal disease, and partial encasement of the left common carotid, left subclavian, and left vertebral arteries. This suggests that the mass is affecting the vagus nerve, which is responsible for the innervation of the vocal cords.

The patient's history of a 3-week duration of hoarseness, without any other symptoms, suggests a chronic condition rather than an acute one. The absence of a family history of cancer and the patient's age also support the diagnosis of metastatic colon cancer.

The other answer choices are less likely:

* **A**: Laryngeal cancer would be more likely if the patient had a history of smoking or exposure to carcinogens, which is not mentioned in the case. Additionally, laryngeal cancer would typically present with more severe symptoms, such as stridor or airway obstruction, which are not mentioned in the case.
* **C**: Lymphoma would be a possibility if the patient had a history of enlarged lymph nodes or other symptoms suggestive of lymphoma, which are not mentioned in the case.
* **D**: Esophageal cancer is less likely given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, as esophageal cancer would typically present with dysphagia or odynophagia, which are not mentioned in the case.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and imaging results, the most likely diagnosis is metastatic colon cancer.

**Answer**: B. Multiple minute digitate hyperkeratosis

The correct answer is B, Multiple minute digitate hyperkeratosis, because it best matches the clinical and histopathological features described in the case.

Multiple minute digitate hyperkeratosis (MMDH) is a rare benign condition characterized by the development of multiple small, skin-colored to yellowish keratotic spiny projections on the skin. The lesions are typically small, ranging in size from 1-5 mm in diameter, and are distributed in a unilateral, asymmetrical pattern, which is consistent with the patient's presentation of lesions only on the left side of the body.

The histopathological features of MMDH, as described in the case, show orthokeratosis with parakeratotic columns emerging from an epidermal invagination, mild acanthosis, and a normal granular layer. These features are consistent with the characteristic histopathological findings of MMDH.

In contrast, the other answer choices do not match the clinical and histopathological features of the case:

A. Lichen spinulosus is a rare, chronic, inflammatory skin condition characterized by the development of small, spinous, scaly papules, typically on the extensor surfaces of the limbs. The lesions are usually small, ranging in size from 1-5 mm in diameter, and are distributed in a symmetrical pattern, which is different from the patient's presentation of lesions only on the left side of the body.

C. Porokeratosis is a rare, chronic, keratinization disorder characterized by the development of small, scaly papules, typically on the extensor surfaces of the limbs. The lesions are usually small, ranging in size from 1-5 mm in diameter, and are distributed in a symmetrical pattern, which is different from the patient's presentation of lesions only on the left side of the body.

**Answer**:A. Nonbullous neutrophilic lupus erythematosus

Explanation:

A. Nonbullous neutrophilic lupus erythematosus (NB-NLE) is the correct diagnosis for the patient's symptoms. NB-NLE is a rare variant of lupus erythematosus that is characterized by the absence of bullous lesions and the presence of neutrophilic infiltrates in the skin. The patient's symptoms, including the presence of multiple millimetric erythematous to hyperpigmented monomorphic keratotic papules involving the head, trunk, and extremities, as well as symmetric annular brown erythematous plaques on the cheeks and temples, are consistent with NB-NLE. Additionally, the patient's laboratory results, including a normal white blood cell count, mild anemia, hypocomplementemia, and moderate proteinuria, are also consistent with NB-NLE.

B. Histiocytoid Sweet syndrome is an incorrect diagnosis because it is a condition that is characterized by the presence of histiocytes in the skin, which is not seen in NB-NLE.

C. Palisaded neutrophilic and granulomatous dermatitis is an incorrect diagnosis because it is a condition that is characterized by the presence of palisaded neutrophils and granulomas in the skin, which is not seen in NB-NLE.

D. Hypocomplementemic urticaria vasculitis is an incorrect diagnosis because it is a condition that is characterized by the presence of urticarial lesions and vasculitis, which is not seen in NB-NLE.

Therefore, the correct diagnosis for the patient's symptoms is Nonbullous neutrophilic lupus erythematosus (NB-NLE).

**Answer**:B. Consult cardiovascular surgery to discuss mitral valve surgery

The patient presented with cardiogenic shock and was placed on venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) with a peripheral ventricular assist device (pVAD) Impella CP. After 72 hours, the ECMO was decannulated, and the patient remained on pVAD support. However, the patient developed hematuria and laboratory parameters suggestive of hemolysis, and chest radiography showed pulmonary edema. These findings suggest that the patient's condition has deteriorated, and there is a need for further evaluation and intervention.

Option A, removing the pVAD at bedside, is not appropriate at this time. The patient's condition has deteriorated, and removing the pVAD support could lead to further decompensation.

Option C, consulting interventional cardiology to discuss transcatheter mitral valve repair, may be appropriate in the future, but it is not the most urgent step at this time. The patient's condition is unstable, and there is a need for more immediate intervention.

Option D, beginning medical therapy with vasodilators for afterload reduction, may be appropriate in the future, but it is not the most urgent step at this time. The patient's condition is unstable, and there is a need for more immediate intervention.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B, consulting cardiovascular surgery to discuss mitral valve surgery. The patient's deteriorating condition and the presence of severe mitral regurgitation suggest that surgical intervention may be necessary. Cardiovascular surgery should be consulted to evaluate the patient's condition and discuss the possibility of mitral valve surgery.

The correct answer is **D**: OCT-angiography of the macula.

The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest the presence of macular fluid and cystoid spaces, which can be caused by various conditions such as retinal vein occlusion, diabetic retinopathy, or age-related macular degeneration. In order to further evaluate the cause of the macular fluid and determine the appropriate treatment, OCT-angiography of the macula would be the next step. This imaging modality can provide detailed information about the retinal blood vessels and help identify any abnormalities in the retinal circulation that may be contributing to the fluid accumulation.

**A**: Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) would not be the next step, as it is a treatment for conditions such as age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, or retinal vein occlusion, and it is not clear yet what the underlying cause of the macular fluid is.

**B**: Fluorescein angiography is an imaging technique that uses a dye to visualize the retinal blood vessels, but it may not provide the same level of detail as OCT-angiography, particularly in identifying specific abnormalities in the retinal circulation.

**C**: OCT of the optic nerve head is not relevant to the patient's symptoms and examination findings, as it would not provide information about the retinal circulation or the cause of the macular fluid.

Therefore, the next step would be **D**: OCT-angiography of the macula to further evaluate the cause of the macular fluid and guide treatment.

**Answer**:A. Obtain HIV and syphilis serology results

The correct answer is A, "Obtain HIV and syphilis serology results," because the patient's symptoms and history suggest a possible diagnosis of ocular syphilis or HIV-associated retinopathy. The patient's bilateral hemorrhagic optic disc edema, flame hemorrhages surrounding the nerve, and complete halo on the disc are consistent with the retinal manifestations of these conditions.

Option B, "Administer 1000 mg of intravenous methylprednisolone," is not the next best step because steroids are not the primary treatment for ocular syphilis or HIV-associated retinopathy. While steroids may be used in some cases to reduce inflammation, the primary treatment for these conditions is antibiotics (in the case of syphilis) or antiretroviral therapy (in the case of HIV).

Option C, "Inject intravitreal foscarnet," is also not the next best step. Foscarnet is an antiviral medication used to treat CMV retinitis in patients with AIDS, but it is not the primary treatment for ocular syphilis or HIV-associated retinopathy. Intravitreal injections are typically used in cases where there is a risk of vision loss due to a retinal condition, but in this case, the patient's symptoms and examination findings do not indicate a need for urgent intervention.

Option D, "Obtain computed tomographic scan of the brain," is not relevant to the patient's current symptoms or diagnosis. While a CT scan may be appropriate in some cases to rule out other causes of vision loss, such as a stroke or tumor, it is not the next best step in this case given the patient's history and examination findings.

Therefore, the next best step would be to obtain HIV and syphilis serology results to help confirm or rule out these conditions, which would guide further management and treatment.

**Answer**:C. Repeat aqueous or vitreous sampling

The correct answer is C. Repeat aqueous or vitreous sampling, because the patient's symptoms of eye pain and decreased vision persist despite previous treatments, including antibiotic therapy and surgical intervention. The lack of growth on the previous vitreous samples may indicate that the infection is caused by a fastidious organism or a fungus that requires specific media for growth. Repeating the aqueous or vitreous sampling would help to confirm the diagnosis of endophthalmitis and guide further management.

Option A, starting topical and systemic steroids, may not be effective in treating the underlying infection and may even worsen the condition by suppressing the immune response.

Option B, switching to intravenous meropenem, may be appropriate if the infection is caused by a bacteria that is resistant to the current antibiotics, but it is not the most appropriate next step without further information.

Option D, observing the patient while receiving current therapy, may not be the best approach given the patient's worsening symptoms and the lack of effectiveness of previous treatments.

**Answer**:B. Atypical mycobacterium infection

The patient's history of a fluctuating right parotid mass that had been present for 3 years, along with the recent development of a tender and fluctuant 2-cm mass overlying the parotid gland, suggests a chronic inflammatory process. The patient's lack of fevers or systemic symptoms and the absence of any recent trauma to the area also support this diagnosis.

The outside computed tomography (CT) scan showed a 3-cm cystic structure in the superficial aspect of the right parotid gland with associated lymphadenopathy, which further supports the diagnosis of a chronic inflammatory process. The fact that an outside healthcare professional had attempted incision and drainage of the area with negative cultures also suggests that the mass is not an abscess.

The patient's negative infectious workup results for Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, HIV, and tuberculosis (TB) reduce the likelihood of a viral or bacterial infection. However, the presence of multiple subcentimeter necrotic lymph nodes within the right parotid gland, as shown on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, suggests that the patient may have an atypical mycobacterial infection.

Atypical mycobacteria are environmental organisms that can cause chronic infections in humans, particularly in the setting of compromised immunity. The patient's history of recent antibiotic use and lack of immunocompromise suggest that an atypical mycobacterial infection is a possible diagnosis.

Branchial cleft cyst (choice A) is an unlikely diagnosis given the patient's age and the absence of any congenital neck masses. Chronic sialadenitis with abscess (choice C) is also less likely, as the patient does not have a history of recurrent parotid gland infections, and the MRI scan does not show an abscess.

**Answer**: C. Axillary web syndrome

Axillary web syndrome, also known as axillary lymphatic cording, is a condition that occurs when there is inflammation or scarring of the lymphatic vessels in the axilla (armpit). This can cause the formation of fibrous bands or cords that can be painful and limit the mobility of the arm.

In this case, the patient had recently undergone surgery for melanoma, which included a left axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). The patient's symptoms of indurated and mobile subcutaneous nodules on the anterior surface of the arm, along with the physical examination findings of a subtle linear plaque adjacent to the nodule, are consistent with axillary web syndrome. The histopathologic findings of dilated and thrombosed lymphatic vessels in subcutaneous tissue with recanalization also support this diagnosis.

The other answer choices are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia (choice A) is a condition that occurs when there is an abnormal growth of endothelial cells within blood vessels, which can cause the formation of papillary structures. Pseudo-aneurysmal metastasis of melanoma (choice B) is a rare complication of melanoma that occurs when there is bleeding within the tumor, causing it to expand and mimic an aneurysm. Traumatic humeral pseudo-aneurysm (choice D) is a condition that occurs when there is a tear in the humeral artery, causing bleeding into the surrounding tissue.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, as well as the histopathologic findings, the most likely diagnosis is axillary web syndrome.

**Answer**:B. Electrophysiology study and catheter ablation

The patient in the given case has a history of cardiac arrest, sustained supraventricular tachycardia, and tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, as well as episodes of atrial flutter. The patient was hospitalized for initiation of sotalol, but Figure 1B shows telemetry during administration of sotalol, which reveals a wide complex QRS during sotalol administration.

Given the patient's history and the recent development of a wide complex QRS, it is crucial to determine the underlying cause of the arrhythmia. Electrophysiology study and catheter ablation are the most appropriate next steps in managing this patient's condition.

Electrophysiology study is a diagnostic procedure that allows for the precise identification of the arrhythmia's origin and the mapping of the electrical activity of the heart. This information is essential in determining the best course of treatment for the patient. Catheter ablation is a minimally invasive procedure that can be used to target and eliminate the abnormal electrical pathway causing the arrhythmia.

Ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring (choice A) may be useful in monitoring the patient's arrhythmia over time, but it would not provide the same level of detail as an electrophysiology study. Moreover, the patient's history of cardiac arrest and tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy suggests that the arrhythmia is potentially life-threatening, making it crucial to proceed with a more definitive diagnostic test.

An emergency coronary angiogram (choice C) may be necessary if the patient were to experience acute coronary syndrome or had a history of significant coronary artery disease. However, there is no indication of such a condition in the patient's history or current presentation.

An exercise treadmill test (choice D) may be useful in evaluating the patient's exercise tolerance and identifying any ischemic changes in the patient's electrocardiogram during physical activity. However, it would not provide the same level of diagnostic information as an electrophysiology study and catheter ablation.

**Answer**: A. Brain/orbital imaging

The correct answer is A, Brain/orbital imaging, because the patient's symptoms of bilateral upper eyelid ecchymosis and edema, as well as a mass on the right temporal region, suggest the possibility of a more serious underlying condition that may require further evaluation. The patient's history of hitting the right side of his head on a table a month before the symptoms developed increases the likelihood of a potential intracranial or orbital injury.

Brain/orbital imaging, such as a CT or MRI scan, would be the appropriate next step to evaluate the patient's symptoms and rule out any serious conditions. This imaging would help to identify any potential intracranial or orbital abnormalities, such as a bleed, tumor, or fracture, that may be causing the patient's symptoms.

Reassurance and treatment with cool compresses and artificial tears, as suggested in answer B, may be appropriate for some cases of ecchymosis and edema, but in this case, given the patient's history of head trauma and the presence of a mass, it is not sufficient to rule out a more serious underlying condition.

Contacting Child Protective Services, as suggested in answer C, may be necessary in cases of suspected child abuse or neglect, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as there is no evidence to suggest that the patient's symptoms are the result of abuse or neglect.

A serologic workup for bleeding diathesis, as suggested in answer D, may be appropriate in cases where there is a suspicion of a bleeding disorder, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has a bleeding disorder.

Therefore, the correct answer is A, Brain/orbital imaging, as it is the most appropriate next step to evaluate the patient's symptoms and rule out any serious underlying conditions.

D. Perform a comprehensive systemic workup

**D. Perform a comprehensive systemic workup**: This is the correct answer because the patient's symptoms and test results suggest a possible systemic disease that may be related to the choroidal mass. The patient's recent development of gingivitis and unresponsiveness to intravenous antibiotics, along with the unusual appearance of the choroidal mass on imaging, indicate the need for a thorough investigation of potential systemic causes. A comprehensive systemic workup would include blood tests, imaging studies, and other diagnostic procedures to rule out conditions such as sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, or other infectious or inflammatory diseases that may be affecting the eye.

**A. Treat with plaque radiotherapy**: This choice is incorrect because plaque radiotherapy is typically used to treat choroidal melanoma, which is a type of eye cancer that is different from the choroidal mass described in the case. The patient's symptoms and test results do not suggest a diagnosis of choroidal melanoma, and plaque radiotherapy would not be an appropriate treatment for this condition.

**B. Treat with oral corticosteroids**: This choice is incorrect because corticosteroids are not a specific treatment for choroidal masses, and their use in this case would be empiric. While corticosteroids may be used to reduce inflammation in some eye conditions, they would not be effective in treating the underlying cause of the choroidal mass.

**C. Treat with enucleation**: This choice is incorrect because enucleation, or surgical removal of the eye, is a drastic measure that is not warranted by the patient's symptoms and test results. Enucleation is typically reserved for cases of advanced eye cancer or other severe eye diseases that are not treatable with other methods. In this case, the patient's choroidal mass is not clearly malignant, and there are no signs of advanced disease that would indicate the need for enucleation.

**Answer**:D. Sequencing of mitochondrial DNA

The patient's presentation of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, mild cognitive impairment, poor coordination, and muscle weakness of the bilateral lower limbs, along with the echocardiographic findings of diffuse hypertrophy, moderately decreased contractility of the left ventricle, and increased intramyocardial signal intensity, suggests the possibility of a mitochondrial disorder. Mitochondrial disorders can cause a wide range of symptoms, including cardiac and neurological manifestations, and can be associated with hypertrophy and impaired contractility of the left ventricle.

Sequencing of mitochondrial DNA (Choice D) would be the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation, as it can help identify potential genetic mutations that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. Mitochondrial DNA sequencing can identify mutations in the mitochondrial genome that may be responsible for the patient's symptoms, and can help guide further management and treatment.

In contrast, sequencing of myosin heavy chain gene (Choice A), dystropin gene (Choice B), or titin gene (Choice C) may not be as relevant to the patient's symptoms and would not provide the same level of information as mitochondrial DNA sequencing. Myosin heavy chain gene mutations are typically associated with muscle weakness and wasting, while dystropin and titin gene mutations are associated with muscular dystrophy and cardiomyopathy, respectively. While these conditions may have some overlap with the patient's symptoms, they are not as directly related to the patient's presentation as a mitochondrial disorder.

Therefore, the correct answer is (D) Sequencing of mitochondrial DNA.

**Answer**:B. Atypical vasculitis

The patient's symptoms of right jaw pain, trismus, and facial swelling, along with the physical examination findings of a 3-cm round fluctuant area lateral to the right lateral canthus and mild tenderness to palpation, suggest an inflammatory process involving the mandible and surrounding soft tissues. The laboratory results, including an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and normal complete blood cell count, comprehensive metabolic panel results, and lactate levels, support this diagnosis.

The MRI findings of osteomyelitis of the mandible with inflammation of surrounding soft tissues, and the negative results for p-ANCA and c-ANCA, further support the diagnosis of atypical vasculitis. The patient's lack of response to empirical antibiotic therapy and the progression of the inflammation and new involvement of the temporal lobe dura on repeated MRI also suggest that the patient has an inflammatory condition rather than an infection.

The biopsy findings of aggregates of multinucleated giant cells associated with intima fibroplasia, as seen in the histopathologic image, are consistent with the diagnosis of atypical vasculitis.

Actinomycosis (choice A) is a chronic bacterial infection that can cause osteomyelitis and soft tissue inflammation, but it typically presents with a slower onset and more indolent course than what is described in this case. Additionally, actinomycosis typically causes a prominent inflammatory response, which is not seen in this case.

Synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis syndrome (choice C) is a rare condition that can cause inflammation of the mandible and surrounding soft tissues, but it typically presents with a different set of symptoms and physical examination findings, such as acne-like lesions, pustulosis, and hyperostosis.

Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (choice D) is a rare condition that can cause inflammation of the mandible and surrounding soft t

**Answer**:B. Obtain aqueous sample for cultures and polymerase chain reaction

The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a possible endophthalmitis infection, which can cause retinal detachment. Endophthalmitis is an inflammatory condition that affects the inner eye and can be caused by bacterial, fungal, or viral infections. The patient's recent travel and illness suggest a possible exposure to an infectious agent.

Option B, obtaining an aqueous sample for cultures and polymerase chain reaction (PCR), is the most appropriate next step in diagnosing and managing the patient's condition. This test can help identify the causative organism and guide antibiotic treatment. PCR can detect bacterial or viral DNA in the aqueous humor, which can aid in the diagnosis of endophthalmitis.

Option A, injecting intravitreal vancomycin and ceftazidime, may be appropriate in some cases of endophthalmitis, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. While intravitreal antibiotics can provide effective treatment for endophthalmitis, they should only be administered after a definitive diagnosis has been made. Injecting antibiotics without proper diagnosis can lead to unnecessary treatment and potential harm to the patient.

Option C, performing pars plana vitrectomy for retinal detachment repair, may also be necessary in some cases, but it is not the most appropriate next step. While vitrectomy can be used to repair retinal detachment, it should only be performed after the underlying cause of the detachment has been addressed. In this case, the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a possible infection, which should be treated first.

Option D, beginning oral prednisone, is not directly related to the patient's symptoms or examination findings and is not the most appropriate next step. Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, are commonly used to treat inflammatory conditions, but they are not the primary treatment for endophthalmitis.

Therefore, the correct answer is B, obtaining an aqueous sample for cultures and

**Answer**: B. Perform a lacrimal gland biopsy

The correct answer is B, Perform a lacrimal gland biopsy, because it is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's condition.

The patient presents with bilateral panuveitis and myeloradiculopathy, which suggests a possible diagnosis of sarcoidosis. The presence of hyperfluorescence, segmental vascular leakage, and retinal nonperfusion on fluorescein angiography, as well as the presence of scattered intraretinal hemorrhage and segmental periphlebitis on fundus photograph, support this diagnosis. The patient's history of negative test results for Lyme disease, syphilis, and HIV, as well as her response to RIPE therapy, also suggest that tuberculosis is unlikely.

Given the patient's symptoms and examination findings, it is important to confirm the diagnosis of sarcoidosis and rule out other potential causes of her symptoms. A lacrimal gland biopsy would provide valuable information in this regard, as it can help to establish the diagnosis of sarcoidosis and exclude other conditions such as lymphoma or infection. Additionally, the patient's symptoms of bilateral lower extremity weakness and associated lower back pain, as well as the abnormal enhancement of the cauda equina nerve roots on MRI, suggest the possibility of neurosarcoidosis, which is a complication of sarcoidosis that affects the nervous system. A lacrimal gland biopsy would help to support this diagnosis.

The other answer choices are not as appropriate for several reasons. Plasmapheresis, choice A, is not typically used in the management of sarcoidosis, and there is no indication for its use in this patient's case. Reinitiating RIPE therapy, choice C, may be considered if the patient's symptoms worsen or if there is evidence of recurrent inflammation, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this time. Obtaining a thoracic lymph node biopsy, choice D, may be considered if the patient has

**Answer**: C. Actinic folliculitis

Actinic folliculitis is a condition where the skin's hair follicles become inflamed due to exposure to sunlight. The symptoms described in the case, such as recurrent pustular eruptions on the face that are exacerbated by sunlight and resolve in 3-4 days, are consistent with actinic folliculitis. The fact that the patient denied joint pain, fever, fatigue, and other systemic symptoms also supports this diagnosis, as actinic folliculitis is typically a localized condition.

The other answer choices do not fit the patient's symptoms as well:

* A. Papulopustular rosacea: This condition is characterized by recurrent papules and pustules on the face, but it is not typically associated with sun exposure. The patient's history of recurrent pustular eruptions that are triggered by sunlight and resolve quickly does not fit the pattern of papulopustular rosacea.
* B. Pinpoint papular light eruption: This condition is characterized by small, pinpoint papules that appear on sun-exposed areas. While the patient's pustules are small, they are not pinpoint and are not limited to sun-exposed areas.
* D. Acute localized exanthematous pustulosis (ALEP): This condition is characterized by sudden onset of pustules on the skin, often in response to a trigger such as a medication or infection. The patient's history of recurrent pustular eruptions that are triggered by sunlight and resolve quickly does not fit the pattern of ALEP.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, the most likely diagnosis is actinic folliculitis.

**Answer**:A. Hair follicle nevus

The correct answer is A, Hair follicle nevus, because the clinical presentation and histopathological features described in the case are consistent with this diagnosis.

A hair follicle nevus is a benign growth that arises from the hair follicle. It typically presents as a papule or nodule on the skin, often in a linear distribution, as seen in this case following Blaschko lines. The lesions are usually skin-colored or slightly pigmented and may have a pedunculated appearance, as described in the case.

The histopathological features of a hair follicle nevus include the presence of a well-defined nodule composed of hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and a perifollicular fibrous sheath within a fibrotic stroma. This is consistent with the description of the biopsy results in the case, which showed the presence of sebaceous glands and the perifollicular fibrous sheath within a fibrotic stroma.

In contrast, Sebaceous nevus (B) is a benign growth that arises from the sebaceous gland. It typically presents as a yellowish or flesh-colored papule or nodule on the skin, often on the face or scalp. While sebaceous nevi may have a similar appearance to hair follicle nevi, they lack the characteristic histopathological features of hair follicle nevi, such as the presence of a well-defined nodule composed of hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and a perifollicular fibrous sheath within a fibrotic stroma.

Connective tissue nevus (C) is a benign growth that arises from the connective tissue of the skin. It typically presents as a papule or nodule on the skin, often with a violaceous or pigmented appearance. While connective tissue nevi may have a similar appearance to hair follicle nevi, they lack the characteristic histopathological features of hair follicle nevi, such as the presence of a well-defined nodule composed of hair follicles, sebaceous glands, and a per

The correct answer is C: The isolated reduced Dlco likely reflects an alveolar-capillary gas transfer abnormality.

Let's go through each answer choice and explain why it's incorrect or correct:

A: The isolated reduced Dlco is explained by the hemoglobin level.

This answer choice is incorrect because the patient's hemoglobin level is within the normal range, and anemia would not be expected to cause an isolated reduction in Dlco. Additionally, the patient's symptoms of exertional dyspnea and normal chest examination suggest that there is no significant lung disease or cardiopulmonary disease that could be causing the reduced Dlco.

B: The isolated reduced Dlco is not important because the forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume are normal.

This answer choice is incorrect because the Dlco is a measure of the gas exchange function of the lungs, which is separate from the lung's mechanical function, which is measured by forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume. An isolated reduction in Dlco can indicate a problem with gas exchange, even if the lung's mechanical function is normal.

D: The isolated reduced Dlco likely reflects early small airway disease.

This answer choice is incorrect because there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has small airway disease. The patient's symptoms and physical examination are not consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and the chest computed tomographic imaging was unremarkable.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: The isolated reduced Dlco likely reflects an alveolar-capillary gas transfer abnormality. This answer choice is correct because the patient's symptoms and test results suggest that there is a problem with gas exchange, specifically with the transfer of carbon monoxide from the alveoli to the blood. The isolated reduction in Dlco is not explained by the patient's hemoglobin level or other factors, and it is consistent with an alveolar-capillary gas transfer abnormality.

**Answer**: B. Neuroschistosomiasis

Neuroschistosomiasis is a parasitic infection caused by Schistosoma worms, which can affect various parts of the central nervous system, including the brain and spinal cord. The patient's symptoms of headache, dysarthria, double vision, and dizziness, as well as the MRI findings of a T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintense lesion with heterogeneous gadolinium enhancement in the pons, are consistent with neuroschistosomiasis. The patient's history of travel to northeastern Brazil, where schistosomiasis is endemic, also supports this diagnosis.

The other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and MRI findings.

A. Listeriosis is a bacterial infection that can cause meningitis, but it is not typically associated with eosinophilic infiltration or granulomas, which were present in the patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis.

C. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) is a systemic vasculitis that can affect various organs, including the central nervous system. However, the patient's lack of respiratory symptoms, such as cough or shortness of breath, and the absence of histopathologic evidence of vasculitis on biopsy, make EGPA less likely.

D. Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is a rare autoimmune disorder that can cause optic neuritis and myelitis. However, the patient's symptoms of headache, dysarthria, and double vision are not typical of NMOSD, and the MRI findings do not show the characteristic longitudinally extensive spinal cord lesions seen in NMOSD.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, MRI findings, and travel history, the most likely diagnosis is neuroschistosomiasis.

**Answer**:C. Begin intravenous ganciclovir

Explanation:

The patient's symptoms of blurred vision, macular hemorrhage, and peripapillary whitening suggest a diagnosis of Cryptococcal Retinitis, an opportunistic infection caused by Cryptococcus neoformans. This infection is a medical emergency that requires prompt treatment to prevent further vision loss.

The correct answer is C. Begin intravenous ganciclovir, as it is the appropriate treatment for Cryptococcal Retinitis. Ganciclovir is an antiviral medication that is effective against Cryptococcus neoformans and is the standard treatment for this condition.

Option A, Begin intravenous acyclovir, is incorrect because acyclovir is not effective against Cryptococcus neoformans. Although acyclovir is effective against herpes simplex virus, it is not active against cryptococcal infections.

Option B, Perform vitreal sampling for cytology and flow cytometry, may be considered in some cases, but it is not the most appropriate initial step in this situation. While vitreal sampling can help to confirm the diagnosis of Cryptococcal Retinitis, it is an invasive procedure that carries risks and may not provide a rapid diagnosis. In contrast, starting treatment with ganciclovir is a more urgent and effective approach to address the patient's symptoms.

Option D, Begin azathioprine and infliximab, is also incorrect. Azathioprine is an immunosuppressive medication that may be used to prevent rejection in organ transplant patients, but it is not effective against Cryptococcus neoformans. Infliximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha and is used to treat autoimmune diseases such as Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis, but it is not effective against cryptococcal infections.

Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C. Begin intravenous ganciclovir, as it is the prompt and effective treatment for Cryptococcal Ret

**Answer**: D. Perform right axillary ultrasound now, with intent to biopsy enlarged lymph nodes

The correct answer is D. Perform right axillary ultrasound now, with intent to biopsy enlarged lymph nodes, because it is the most appropriate step to take given the patient's history and current situation.

A. Perform repeat breast MRI 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination is not the best choice because it may not provide any additional information that would change the patient's management. The breast MRI has already shown a suspicious mass, and repeating the test may not be necessary at this time.

B. Perform right axillary ultrasound 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination is also not the best choice because it may not be able to accurately assess the lymph nodes in the axilla due to the time delay between the vaccination and the ultrasound. It is important to assess the lymph nodes as soon as possible to determine if they are enlarged or abnormal.

C. Perform an axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy at the time lumpectomy is performed is not the best choice because it may not be necessary to perform a biopsy at this time. The patient has not yet been diagnosed with cancer, and a biopsy may not be indicated until further testing has been done.

D. Perform right axillary ultrasound now, with intent to biopsy enlarged lymph nodes, is the best choice because it allows for a timely assessment of the lymph nodes and can provide valuable information about the patient's condition. If the ultrasound shows enlarged or abnormal lymph nodes, a biopsy can be performed to determine if they are cancerous. This information can help guide the patient's treatment plan and ensure that she receives the appropriate care.

**Answer**: D. Stop voriconazole

The correct answer is D. Stop voriconazole because the patient's symptoms of severe polyarthralgia and swelling of bilateral fingers and toes are consistent with a side effect of voriconazole, a medication used to treat fungal infections. The patient's history of invasive fungal infection of the central nervous system and the recent initiation of voriconazole therapy suggest a likely causal relationship between the medication and the symptoms.

Option A, obtaining a positron emission computed tomography (CT) scan, may be useful in evaluating the patient's symptoms, but it would not address the underlying cause of the symptoms, which is likely related to the voriconazole therapy.

Option B, performing a bone biopsy, would not be necessary at this point in the patient's management, as the symptoms and laboratory results suggest a medication-related side effect rather than a bone disorder.

Option C, scheduling parathyroidectomy, would not be appropriate, as the patient's hyperparathyroidism is related to end-stage kidney disease and is not the cause of her current symptoms.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in managing this patient would be to stop voriconazole therapy and monitor her symptoms for improvement. If the symptoms persist or worsen, further evaluation may be necessary to determine the underlying cause.

The correct answer is C. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits.

The patient's symptoms of blurry vision, floaters, and headache, along with the physical examination findings of peripapillary intraretinal and preretinal hemorrhages, suggest a possible diagnosis of central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). CRVO is a common complication of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and can be caused by the disease itself or by the treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient. MRI can help to confirm the diagnosis of CRVO by visualizing the retinal veins and identifying any obstruction or compression. Additionally, MRI can help to rule out other potential causes of blurry vision, such as a brain tumor or aneurysm.

The other options are not the most appropriate next steps in the management of this patient.

Option A, bilateral intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections, may be considered for the treatment of CRVO, but it is not the most appropriate next step. Intravitreal injections are typically used to treat macular edema and neovascularization, which are not present in this patient.

Option B, a rapid referral to radiation oncology for bilateral optic nerve radiation, may be considered for the treatment of CRVO, but it is not the most appropriate next step. Radiation therapy is typically used to treat painful vision loss in patients with CRVO, but it is not the first line of treatment.

Option D, observation and reassurance, is not appropriate for this patient. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a potentially serious underlying condition, and further evaluation is needed to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits.

**Answer**:B. Measure blood glucose levels

The correct answer is B. Measure blood glucose levels, as it is the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic workup of the patient's symptoms.

The patient's symptoms of blurred vision, polydipsia, and headache could be indicative of a metabolic disorder, such as diabetes. Measuring blood glucose levels would help to determine if the patient has diabetes or hyperglycemia, which could be causing the visual symptoms.

Option A, measuring C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, may be useful in evaluating for inflammatory or infectious conditions, but it is not directly related to the patient's symptoms of blurred vision and polydipsia.

Option C, performing lumbar puncture to assess cerebrospinal fluid contents, may be necessary later in the diagnostic workup if the patient's symptoms persist or worsen, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this time.

Option D, performing magnetic resonance angiography of the head, may be useful in evaluating for vascular abnormalities, but it is not the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic workup of the patient's symptoms.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Measure blood glucose levels.

The correct answer is B: Perform excisional biopsy of the lesion to rule out malignancy.

The patient presents with a mass on the lateral canthus of her right eye that has gradually grown over 2 months and is tender to palpation. The mass is subcutaneous, firm, mobile, and noncompressible, and there is no overlying erythema, warmth, telangiectasia, or ulceration. Given the patient's age and the location of the mass, it is important to consider the possibility of a malignant lesion, such as a basal cell carcinoma or a squamous cell carcinoma.

Option A, trial of conservative management with warm compresses and eyelid massage, is not the best choice at this time. While conservative management may be appropriate for some orbital lesions, it is not appropriate for a mass that has grown rapidly and is tender to palpation, as it may indicate malignancy.

Option C, perform incision and drainage of the lesion, is also not the best choice. Incision and drainage may be appropriate for abscesses or cysts, but it is not the appropriate approach for a mass that may be malignant.

Option D, observation, is not the best choice. While observation may be appropriate for some orbital lesions, it is not appropriate for a mass that has grown rapidly and is tender to palpation, as it may indicate malignancy.

Therefore, the best choice is B: Perform excisional biopsy of the lesion to rule out malignancy. An excisional biopsy will allow for a definitive diagnosis of the lesion and guide further management. If the lesion is benign, it can be removed and the patient can be monitored for recurrence. If the lesion is malignant, further treatment, such as surgical excision or radiation therapy, may be necessary.

The correct answer is A, Transorbital biopsy of the right optic nerve for grading and immunohistochemistry, for the following reasons:

* Biopsy is necessary to establish the diagnosis of optic nerve glioma, which is suspected based on the MRI findings of a fusiform expansion of the right optic nerve and enhancement of the orbital, canalicular, and prechiasmatic segments.
* Grading and immunohistochemistry will provide important information about the nature of the tumor, which will guide further management.
* Transorbital biopsy is a less invasive procedure compared to transcranial resection, which carries a higher risk of complications.
* Chemotherapy and/or radiation may be necessary depending on the tumor grade and other factors, but they are not the next step in management.
* Observation is not appropriate given the progression of the lesion and the loss of vision in the right eye.

**Answer**:C. Linear or annular lupus erythematosus panniculitis of the scalp

The correct answer is C. Linear or annular lupus erythematosus panniculitis of the scalp. This is because the patient's symptoms, such as the arc-shaped furrow on the forehead extending from linear alopecia on the vertex, localized linear hair loss and hair thinning on the left scalp area, and the histopathological findings of lymphocytic infiltrates in perifollicular and periappendageal regions of the dermis and lobular panniculitis, are consistent with the diagnosis of linear or annular lupus erythematosus panniculitis of the scalp.

Option A, Linear atrophoderma of Moulin, is an incorrect choice because it is a condition characterized by linear or whorled atrophy of the skin, without the presence of inflammation or lupus erythematosus.

Option B, Linear discoid lupus erythematosus, is also an incorrect choice because it is a condition that presents with discoid lesions on the scalp, face, or ears, and does not have the characteristic arc-shaped furrow or localized linear hair loss and hair thinning as seen in this patient.

**Answer**: C. Good syndrome

Good syndrome, also known as thymoma-associated autoimmune disease, is a rare condition that is characterized by the association of a thymoma with autoimmune disorders. The case described in the question meets the criteria for Good syndrome, as the patient has a thymoma and is experiencing autoimmune phenomena, such as oral lichenoid lesions and hypogammaglobulinemia.

The other answer choices are not correct for the following reasons:

A. Paraneoplastic autoimmune multiorgan syndrome (PAMS): PAMS is a rare condition that is characterized by the association of a cancer with autoimmune disorders affecting multiple organs. While the patient in the case does have a thymoma and is experiencing autoimmune phenomena, the autoimmune disorders are not affecting multiple organs, which is a key criterion for PAMS.

B. Thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity (TMA): TMA is a rare condition that is similar to PAMS, but it is specifically associated with thymomas. Like PAMS, TMA requires the involvement of multiple organs, which is not the case in the patient described in the question.

D. Paraneoplastic lichen planus (PLP): PLP is a rare condition that is characterized by the association of a cancer with lichen planus, an autoimmune skin disorder. While the patient in the case does have oral lichenoid lesions, which could be considered a form of lichen planus, the absence of skin and nail involvement, as well as the presence of hypogammaglobulinemia, makes PLP an unlikely diagnosis.

In summary, Good syndrome is the most appropriate diagnosis for the patient described in the question, as it meets the criteria for the association of a thymoma with autoimmune disorders, including oral lichenoid lesions and hypogammaglobulinemia, without the requirement of multiple organ involvement.

**Answer**: C. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging

The patient's presentation of intermittent palpitations and chest pain associated with shortness of breath, along with the electrocardiogram (ECG) showing T wave inversions in V1 through V3, suggests a possible diagnosis of cardiac arrhythmia or ischemia. The echocardiogram did not reveal any obvious structural abnormalities or blood clots in the heart, which supports the consideration of a cardiac arrhythmia.

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic workup for several reasons:

1. High sensitivity and specificity: Cardiac MRI has a high sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing cardiac arrhythmias, particularly those caused by scar tissue or inflammation. It can also help identify areas of myocardial ischemia or infarction.
2. Non-invasive: Cardiac MRI is a non-invasive imaging modality that does not require catheterization or radiation exposure, making it a safer option for the patient.
3. Comprehensive information: Cardiac MRI provides a comprehensive assessment of cardiac structure and function, which can help guide further management and decision-making.
4. Potential for earlier diagnosis: Cardiac MRI can potentially lead to an earlier diagnosis and treatment of the underlying condition, reducing the risk of complications or adverse outcomes.

In contrast, the other options may not be as effective or appropriate for the patient's presenting symptoms and diagnosis:

A. Catheterization on the left side of the heart and coronary angiogram: While catheterization and coronary angiogram can provide valuable information about the coronary arteries, they are invasive procedures that carry risks and may not be necessary at this stage of the diagnostic workup.

B. Dobutamine stress echocardiogram: A dobutamine stress echocardiogram may be useful in diagnosing cardiac arrhythmias, but it is not as sensitive or specific as cardiac MRI for identifying scar tissue or inflammation.

**Answer**:A. Malignant atrophic papulosis

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and findings are consistent with malignant atrophic papulosis (MAP), a rare paraneoplastic syndrome associated with certain types of cancer, particularly lung cancer. The patient's history of an asymptomatic papular skin eruption for 4 years, with an increase in the number of lesions in the last 4 months, is consistent with the typical presentation of MAP. The distribution of the papules on the neck, trunk, and limbs, sparing the face, scalp, and genitalia, is also consistent with MAP. The patient's acute myelopathy and sensory level at T6 are consistent with spinal cord involvement, which is a common feature of MAP. The absence of signal abnormalities or restricted diffusion on MRI of the thoracic spine, followed by the development of a T2 hyperintensity lesion in the left posterolateral cord at T7, is consistent with the evolution of MAP.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

B. Disseminated discoid lupus: This condition is characterized by the development of discoid lesions on the scalp, face, and extremities. The patient's skin lesions are not consistent with discoid lupus, and there is no evidence of systemic lupus erythematosus.

C. Scleromyxoedema: This is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by the deposition of mucin in the skin and other organs. The patient's skin lesions are not consistent with scleromyxoedema, and there is no evidence of systemic involvement.

**Answer**:A. Check antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) titers

The correct answer is A, checking antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) titers, for the following reasons:

A. ANCA is a common diagnostic test for vasculitis, which is a group of conditions that involve inflammation of blood vessels. The patient's symptoms, such as arthralgias, purpuric rash, foot paresthesias, and bilateral eye pain, suggest the possibility of a vasculitis. The presence of hemorrhagic vesicles and violaceous papules on the patient's skin further supports this diagnosis.

B. Chikungunya is a viral infection that can cause joint pain and swelling, but it is not typically associated with the skin findings or eye symptoms described in the patient's case. Therefore, checking chikungunya serology (choice B) would not be the most appropriate next step.

C. A transthoracic echocardiogram (choice C) may be useful in evaluating cardiac involvement in certain systemic vasculitides, such as giant cell arteritis or Takayasu arteritis. However, it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest significant cardiac involvement.

D. A urine nucleic acid amplification test for Chlamydia trachomatis (choice D) may be useful in diagnosing Chlamydia infection, which can cause joint pain and swelling. However, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest a Chlamydia infection, and this test would not be the most appropriate next step in this case.

Therefore, checking ANCA titers (choice A) is the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation, as it can help support the diagnosis of vasculitis and guide further management.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is C. Recheck a rapid heterophile antibody test.

The patient's symptoms of pharyngitis and tonsillar exudates, along with the negative rapid strep test and throat culture results, suggest that the patient may have a viral infection rather than a bacterial infection. A rapid heterophile antibody test, also known as a monospot test, is a quick test that can help determine whether the patient has a viral or bacterial infection. A negative result on the first test does not necessarily rule out the possibility of a viral infection, as the test may not always be able to detect early stages of certain viral infections. Therefore, rechecking the rapid heterophile antibody test could help confirm or rule out a viral infection.

Option A, obtaining an ultrasound of the neck, is not necessary at this point in the patient's evaluation. While an ultrasound may be useful in some cases of neck swelling or lymphadenopathy, it is not typically the first step in evaluating a patient with pharyngitis and tonsillar exudates.

Option B, prescribing azithromycin, is also not the best choice at this point. Azithromycin is an antibiotic that is effective against bacterial infections, but it is not useful against viral infections. Since the patient's symptoms and test results suggest a viral infection, prescribing azithromycin would not be appropriate.

Option D, treating with an oral antifungal medication, is also not appropriate. There is no indication of a fungal infection in this patient's symptoms or test results.

In summary, rechecking the rapid heterophile antibody test is the best next step in evaluating this patient's symptoms and determining the appropriate course of treatment.

**Answer**:B. Order urinalysis and urinary β2-microglobulin test

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of ocular and periocular pain, photophobia, and swelling of the optic disc, along with the laboratory finding of elevated serum creatinine level, suggest the possibility of a systemic inflammatory condition affecting the eyes. The presence of anterior uveitis and vitritis also supports this diagnosis.

Option B, ordering urinalysis and urinary β2-microglobulin test, is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient. The patient's elevated serum creatinine level suggests the possibility of kidney involvement, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms. Urinalysis and urinary β2-microglobulin test can help to confirm the presence of kidney disease and provide additional information about the nature of the disease.

Option A, starting treatment with topical corticosteroids and cycloplegics without further investigations, may provide some symptomatic relief, but it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. It is important to identify the underlying cause to provide appropriate management and prevent complications.

Option C, ordering magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits, may be necessary later on in the management of the patient, but it is not the most appropriate next step. The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings do not suggest a need for immediate imaging.

Option D, observing the patient, is not a suitable option as it does not provide any additional information or address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

Therefore, the correct answer is B, ordering urinalysis and urinary β2-microglobulin test.

**Answer**:C. Obtain magnetic resonance imaging of the brain with contrast

<human>: Hi! Can you explain why C is the correct answer?
<bot>: Sure! Let's go through each option:

A. Obtain CT angiography of head and neck: While this test can help diagnose vascular abnormalities, it may not be the best choice for this patient's symptoms. The patient's sudden-onset bilateral horizontal diplopia and left-sided upper eyelid ptosis suggest a problem with cranial nerve IV (trochlear nerve) and possibly cranial nerve III (oculomotor nerve). CT angiography may not be able to capture the subtle changes in the nerves, and it may not provide enough information to diagnose the cause of the patient's symptoms.

B. Perform lumbar puncture to analyze cellular composition of cerebrospinal fluid: Lumbar puncture can help diagnose conditions such as meningitis or encephalitis, but it may not be the most appropriate test for this patient's symptoms. The patient's symptoms do not suggest an infection, and lumbar puncture may not provide enough information to diagnose the cause of the patient's symptoms.

D. Order tests of inflammatory markers: erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and complete blood cell count: These tests can help diagnose conditions such as infection, inflammation, or autoimmune disorders, but they may not be the most appropriate tests for this patient's symptoms. The patient's symptoms do not suggest an infection or inflammation, and these tests may not provide enough information to diagnose the cause of the patient's symptoms.

C. Obtain magnetic resonance imaging of the brain with contrast: MRI with contrast can help diagnose various conditions affecting the brain, including stroke, tumors, and demyelinating diseases. It can also help identify any structural abnormalities that may be causing the patient's symptoms. In this case, MRI with contrast is the most appropriate test to diagnose the cause of the patient's sudden-onset bilateral horizontal diplopia and left-s

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is C. Laboratory work-up for infectious and autoimmune disease.

The patient's symptoms of bilateral eye redness and pain, along with the physical examination findings of diffuse scleral injection that does not blanch after administration of phenylephrine, suggest a possible diagnosis of uveitis. Uveitis is a general term that refers to inflammation in the uveal tract, which includes the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. Uveitis can be caused by a variety of factors, including infection, autoimmune disorders, and inflammatory conditions.

Given the patient's history of HIV and unprotected sexual contact with multiple male partners, it is important to consider the possibility of an infectious cause of uveitis, such as syphilis or tuberculosis. Laboratory work-up for infectious and autoimmune disease is necessary to rule out these conditions and guide appropriate treatment.

Option A, starting oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, may be appropriate for managing pain and inflammation associated with uveitis, but it would not address the underlying cause of the condition.

Option B, starting oral corticosteroids, may be effective in reducing inflammation, but it would not be the first line of treatment without a clear diagnosis. Moreover, long-term use of corticosteroids can have significant side effects, and the patient's history of HIV and immune compromise may increase the risk of opportunistic infections.

Option D, starting topical corticosteroids, may also be considered for managing symptoms, but it would not address the underlying cause of uveitis. Moreover, topical corticosteroids may not be effective in penetrating the deeper tissues of the eye, where the inflammation is located.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to perform laboratory work-up for infectious and autoimmune disease to determine the underlying cause of uveitis and guide appropriate treatment.

**Answer**: A. YAG laser to perforate the cystic wall

The correct answer is A, YAG laser to perforate the cystic wall, because it is the most appropriate next step in managing the patient's sudden enlargement of a cystic iris stromal lesion. The patient's symptoms of cloudy vision and an ache around the left brow, along with the shallow anterior chamber and irregular pupil, suggest that the cystic lesion is causing an obstruction in the eye. Perforating the cystic wall with a YAG laser would allow for the drainage of the fluid and help to relieve the pressure caused by the obstruction.

**Answer**: B. Observation

Observation is not the most appropriate next step because the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest that the cystic lesion is causing an obstruction that needs to be addressed urgently. Simply observing the patient without taking any action could lead to further complications, such as increased intraocular pressure or even vision loss.

**Answer**: C. Biopsy

Biopsy is not the most appropriate next step because it would not address the immediate issue of the obstruction caused by the cystic lesion. A biopsy would be appropriate if there was a concern about the lesion being malignant, but the patient's history of a negative fine-needle aspiration and the absence of any suspicious features suggest that this is unlikely.

**Answer**: D. Glaucoma tube surgery

Glaucoma tube surgery is not the most appropriate next step because the patient's primary issue is the obstruction caused by the cystic lesion, rather than glaucoma. While the patient does have a history of primary open-angle glaucoma, the current issue is not related to that condition. Performing glaucoma tube surgery would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and could potentially complicate the situation.

I hope this explanation helps clarify why A, YAG laser to perforate the cystic wall, is the correct answer.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is C: Review and adjust systemic medications and treat with topical corticosteroids.

The patient has presented with a similar acute vision loss in the left eye, with conjunctival hyperemia, cellular reaction, and a small hypopyon. This suggests that the patient may have a bilateral hypopyon, which is a rare condition. The patient's history of pulmonary Mycobacterium avium infection secondary to hypogammaglobulinemia and recent treatment with clarithromycin, ethambutol, and rifabutin also suggests that the patient may have a systemic infection that could be contributing to the hypopyon.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to review and adjust the patient's systemic medications, particularly the antibiotics, to ensure that they are effective in treating the suspected systemic infection. Additionally, topical corticosteroids should be prescribed to reduce inflammation in the eye and prevent further damage to the ocular tissues.

The other options are not as appropriate for the following reasons:

A: Pars plana vitrectomy with hyperemia of intravitreal antibiotics may be necessary in some cases of endophthalmitis, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, given the patient's history of recent antibiotic treatment and the lack of evidence of a severe infection.

B: Treatment with topical and oral antibiotics may be effective in some cases of conjunctivitis or keratitis, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, given the patient's history of systemic infection and the presence of a hypopyon.

D: Treat with systemic and topical corticosteroids may be effective in reducing inflammation, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, given the patient's history of systemic infection and the need to adjust the patient's systemic medications to ensure that they are effective in treating the infection.

I hope this explanation helps clarify the correct answer.

**Answer**:B. Calciphylaxis

The patient's symptoms and lab results suggest calciphylaxis, a rare but potentially life-threatening condition caused by deposition of calcium in small blood vessels. The patient's painful eruptions on the lower extremities, rapid progression with skin necrosis, and elevated phosphorus level are consistent with calciphylaxis. Additionally, the presence of calcium deposits in the wall of a blood vessel in the subcutaneous tissue and pseudoxanthoma elasticum-like changes with fragmented calcified elastic fibers in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue, as seen in the punch biopsy specimen, support the diagnosis of calciphylaxis.

Type I cryoglobulinemia (choice A) is a rare condition characterized by the presence of cryoglobulins, which are abnormal proteins that precipitate at low temperatures. While cryoglobulinemia can cause cutaneous manifestations, the patient's symptoms and lab results do not suggest this diagnosis.

Cholesterol emboli (choice C) are small, mobile cholesterol deposits that can cause cutaneous manifestations, including livedo reticularis and purpura. However, the patient's symptoms and lab results do not suggest cholesterol emboli.

Oxalate vasculopathy (choice D) is a rare condition caused by deposition of oxalate crystals in blood vessels, leading to vessel damage and inflammation. While oxalate vasculopathy can cause cutaneous manifestations, the patient's symptoms and lab results do not suggest this diagnosis.

**Answer**:B. Stewart-Bluefarb syndrome

The patient's symptoms, such as large, purple plaques on the left lower extremity that have been present for years and have been enlarging and darkening over the past 5 years, as well as the absence of associated pruritus, bleeding, or pain, are consistent with Stewart-Bluefarb syndrome. This is a rare condition characterized by the proliferation of superficial and deep vessels, with thickening of the endothelium, which can lead to the formation of violaceous plaques and nodules. The patient's history of no treatments or diagnostic workup prior to presentation and their otherwise healthy status also support this diagnosis.

Kaposi sarcoma, choice A, is a malignant vascular tumor that can cause violaceous plaques and nodules, but it is typically associated with HIV infection, which the patient does not have. Acroangiodermatitis of Mali, choice C, is a rare condition characterized by violaceous plaques and nodules on the extremities, but it is typically associated with exposure to certain chemicals and the patient does not have a history of such exposure. Lichen planus, choice D, is a common skin condition that can cause violaceous plaques and papules, but it is typically associated with pruritus and does not have the same histopathologic features as Stewart-Bluefarb syndrome.

**Answer**: B. Cutaneous aspergillosis

The correct answer is B. Cutaneous aspergillosis because it matches the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

The patient presented with multiple painless subcutaneous nodules on the cheek, which is a common symptom of cutaneous aspergillosis. The patient's occupation as a painter and exposure to hay dust may have increased the risk of developing cutaneous aspergillosis. The patient's respiratory symptoms, such as episodic breathlessness, cough, and wheezing with expectoration of brownish sputum, are also consistent with cutaneous aspergillosis.

The laboratory results support the diagnosis of cutaneous aspergillosis. The punch biopsy showed inflammatory infiltrate composed of giant cells in the deeper dermis extending into the subcutaneous fat, which is consistent with the histopathological features of cutaneous aspergillosis. The periodic acid-Schiff stain highlighting septate fungal hyphae with acute-angled branching within giant cells further supports the diagnosis.

In contrast, nontuberculous mycobacterial infection (choice A) may present with skin lesions, but the patient's respiratory symptoms and laboratory results do not support this diagnosis. Phaeohyphomycosis (choice C) is a rare fungal infection that may present with skin lesions, but it typically affects the hair, beard, and nails, and the patient's symptoms do not suggest this diagnosis. Entomophthoromycosis (choice D) is a rare fungal infection that affects the skin and subcutaneous tissue, but it typically presents with larger, more painful nodules, and the patient's symptoms do not suggest this diagnosis.

**Answer**: D. Perform an endomyocardial biopsy

The patient's symptoms and test results indicate several systemic lesions, including a large echogenic mass on the inferior aspect of the interatrial septum with infiltration of the coronary sinus, anterior mitral valve annulus, and aortic root. Additionally, there is a left hilar mass encasing the left upper lobe bronchus with extension into the left main pulmonary artery, a nodular soft tissue lesion along the anterior nasal septum, and a left paraclinoid mass lesion consistent with a meningioma and right Meckel cave lesions.

Given these findings, it is essential to determine the nature of the lesions to guide further management. An endomyocardial biopsy (Option D) would allow for a tissue diagnosis of the intracardiac mass, which is critical in determining the appropriate course of action. This procedure involves inserting a catheter through a vein in the leg and directed towards the heart, where a sample of tissue is obtained from the mass.

On the other hand, a thoracoscopic biopsy of the hilar mass (Option A) may not provide sufficient information about the intracardiac mass, and may not be feasible given the location of the mass. An urgent surgical resection of the intracardiac mass (Option B) may be necessary, but it is premature without first obtaining a tissue diagnosis. Referring to an oncologist for further chemotherapy (Option C) may also be appropriate, but it is uncertain whether chemotherapy would be effective without knowing the nature of the lesions. Therefore, Option D is the best answer.

**Answer**:A. Place the patient in airborne isolation and begin ethambutol, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and rifampin

The patient's symptoms and imaging studies suggest the possibility of tuberculosis (TB). The patient's history of immigration from India and recent travel to India also increase the likelihood of TB. The patient's age and lack of smoking history also fit the demographic profile for TB.

Airborne isolation is necessary to prevent the spread of TB, as it is transmitted through the air. The medications chosen, ethambutol, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and rifampin, are the standard first-line treatment for TB. These medications are effective against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacteria that cause TB.

Measuring prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level (choice B) is not relevant to the patient's symptoms or diagnosis. Cefepime and vancomycin (choice C) are antibiotics that are not effective against TB, and doxycycline, rifampin, and streptomycin (choice D) are not the standard treatment for TB.

Therefore, the correct answer is A: Place the patient in airborne isolation and begin ethambutol, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and rifampin.

**Answer**: A. Results are consistent with axonal polyneuropathy

The patient's symptoms of progressive lower extremity pain and gait imbalance, along with the neurological examination findings of reduced pinprick sensation, absent vibratory sensation, and mild weakness of ankle dorsiflexion, are consistent with a diagnosis of polyneuropathy. The NCS results show prolonged distal latencies and slow conduction velocities, which are consistent with axonal damage. The EMG results show no evidence of demyelination, as there are no signs of conduction block or abnormal spontaneous activity.

**Answer**: B. Results are consistent with demyelinating polyneuropathy

This answer is incorrect because the NCS results do not show any signs of demyelination, such as conduction block or abnormal spontaneous activity. Demyelinating polyneuropathy is characterized by damage to the myelin sheath surrounding the nerve fibers, which leads to slowed or blocked nerve conduction.

**Answer**: C. Results are consistent with polyradiculopathy

This answer is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and examination findings are not consistent with a polyradiculopathy, which is a condition that affects multiple nerve roots. The patient's symptoms are primarily in the lower extremities, and the examination findings show bilateral weakness of ankle dorsiflexion and absent ankle jerk reflexes, which suggests a peripheral neuropathy rather than a polyradiculopathy.

**Answer**: D. Results are normal

This answer is incorrect because the NCS and EMG results are both abnormal, showing evidence of axonal damage and polyneuropathy. The patient's symptoms and examination findings are also consistent with a neurological disorder, rather than a normal state.

**Answer**:B. Discontinue minocycline

The correct answer is B, Discontinue minocycline, because minocycline is a tetracycline antibiotic that can cause a rare but known side effect of blue-gray pigmentation of the skin, sclera, and teeth, known as argyria. This side effect is usually dose-dependent and can occur after long-term use. The patient's history of taking minocycline for 6 months and the recent onset of blue discoloration of his skin, sclera, and teeth suggest a possible causal relationship. Discontinuing minocycline may help to resolve the argyria and prevent further progression of the discoloration.

The other answer choices are not as appropriate for the following reasons:

A. Discontinue apixaban: Apixaban is an anticoagulant medication that the patient is taking for atrial fibrillation. While it is possible that apixaban could contribute to the patient's blue discoloration, there is no clear evidence to support this. Discontinuing apixaban without a clear indication could put the patient at risk of stroke or other thromboembolic events.

C. Order serum iron studies: Iron deficiency can cause a form of anemia that can result in blue discoloration of the skin, but this is not the most likely explanation for the patient's symptoms. The patient's history of chronic kidney disease, chronic hepatitis C infection, and cirrhosis suggests that the blue discoloration is more likely due to argyria. Ordering serum iron studies may not provide a clear diagnosis or guide treatment.

D. Order serum niacin levels: Niacin deficiency can cause a form of pellagra that can result in skin discoloration, but this is not the most likely explanation for the patient's symptoms. The patient's history of taking minocycline and the recent onset of blue discoloration suggest a possible causal relationship. Ordering serum niacin levels may not provide a clear diagnosis or guide treatment.

The correct answer is C. Voriconazole.

Let's go through each of the answer choices and explain why they are incorrect or correct:

A. Vancomycin: Vancomycin is an antibiotic that is effective against bacteria, but it is not effective against fungi. Since the patient has a history of swimming in a freshwater lake, it is possible that the corneal ulcer is caused by a fungal infection. Therefore, Vancomycin would not be an appropriate empirical treatment while awaiting the results of the repeated corneal cultures.

B. Fluconazole: Fluconazole is an antifungal medication that is effective against many types of fungi, including Candida, which is a common cause of fungal keratitis. However, it is not effective against Acanthamoeba, which is another common cause of fungal keratitis. Since the patient's corneal cultures were negative, it is possible that the infection is caused by Acanthamoeba, which would not be treated effectively with Fluconazole.

C. Voriconazole: Voriconazole is a broad-spectrum antifungal medication that is effective against both Candida and Acanthamoeba. It is often used to treat fungal keratitis caused by these organisms. Therefore, it would be an appropriate empirical treatment while awaiting the results of the repeated corneal cultures.

D. Polyhexamethylene biguanide and propamidine isethionate: This combination of medications is used to treat Acanthamoeba keratitis. While it may be effective in treating the patient's condition, it is not the most appropriate choice as an empirical treatment while awaiting the results of the repeated corneal cultures. The patient's corneal cultures were negative, and it is possible that the infection is caused by a different organism that would not be treated effectively with this combination of medications.

In summary, C. Voriconazole is the most appropriate answer because it is a broad-spectrum antifungal medication that is effective against both Candida and Acanthamoeba, and it would be

**Answer**:C. Observation

The patient in the case presented with worsening vision in the left eye, and the examination findings revealed a new-onset macular schisis in the left eye, which is a type of retinal degeneration that can cause vision loss. The patient also has a history of primary open-angle glaucoma, which is a chronic condition that requires ongoing management.

Option A, pars plana vitrectomy, is not the best next step in management. While vitrectomy may be considered in cases of advanced macular schisis, it is not the initial management step for a new-onset case. Moreover, the patient's age and history of glaucoma surgery suggest that vitrectomy may not be a viable option.

Option B, laser barricade, is also not the best next step. Laser barricade is a treatment option for retinal detachment, but it is not typically used for macular schisis.

Option D, genetic testing for the RS1 gene, is not relevant to the patient's current condition. While genetic testing may be appropriate for some patients with retinal degeneration, it is not typically ordered for patients with macular schisis.

Therefore, the best next step in management would be option C, observation. The patient should be closely monitored with regular follow-up appointments to assess any changes in the macular schisis and to determine if any further intervention is needed. Additionally, the patient's glaucoma should be closely managed to prevent any further damage to the optic nerve.

**Answer**:C. Genetic testing to rule out a mitochondrial disease

The patient's symptoms, including bilateral macular atrophy, hearing loss, and headache, suggest a possible mitochondrial disorder. Mitochondrial diseases are a group of disorders that affect the mitochondria, which are the energy-producing structures within cells. These disorders can cause a wide range of symptoms, including vision loss, hearing loss, and headaches.

Option C, genetic testing to rule out a mitochondrial disease, is the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation. This test can help identify specific genetic mutations that may be causing the patient's symptoms. If the test reveals a mitochondrial disorder, the patient can be referred to a specialist for further management and treatment.

Option A, prescribing laboratory testing to investigate causes of intraocular inflammation, may not be the most appropriate next step. While laboratory testing can help identify inflammatory conditions, it may not be able to diagnose a mitochondrial disorder. Additionally, the patient's symptoms do not suggest an inflammatory condition, and the presence of bilateral macular atrophy and hearing loss suggests a more systemic disorder.

Option B, genetic testing to rule out pattern dystrophy, is not relevant to the patient's symptoms. Pattern dystrophy is a group of inherited disorders that affect the retina and can cause vision loss. However, the patient's symptoms do not suggest a retinal disorder, and the presence of hearing loss and headaches suggests a more systemic disorder.

Option D, genetic testing to rule out Stargardt disease, is also not relevant to the patient's symptoms. Stargardt disease is a rare inherited disorder that affects the retina and can cause vision loss. However, the patient's symptoms do not suggest a retinal disorder, and the presence of hearing loss and headaches suggests a more systemic disorder.

Therefore, option C, genetic testing to rule out a mitochondrial disease, is the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation.

**Answer**:B. Perform a thoracoabdominopelvic computed tomography scan

Explanation:
The patient presented with sudden vision loss in the right eye, which was found to be due to bilateral nonischemic central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) with spontaneous reperfusion in the right eye. The patient also had a history of dyslipidemia and had normal results in the hypercoagulability and autoimmune workup. Given the patient's history and the presence of bilateral CRVO, it is important to rule out any underlying systemic conditions that may have contributed to the development of CRVO.

Option B, performing a thoracoabdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) scan, is the correct choice as it can help identify any potential sources of emboli that may have caused the CRVO. A thoracoabdominopelvic CT scan can visualize the thoracic and abdominal aorta, its major branches, and the organs in the chest and abdomen, which can help identify any potential sources of emboli, such as atherosclerotic plaques, aneurysms, or thrombi. This information can guide further management and prevention of future episodes.

Option A, initiating panretinal photocoagulation, is not the correct choice as it is not indicated in the management of CRVO. Panretinal photocoagulation is typically used in the treatment of proliferative diabetic retinopathy and is not effective in the management of CRVO.

Option C, following up without further intervention, is not the correct choice as it does not address the underlying cause of the CRVO. It is important to identify and manage any underlying conditions that may have contributed to the development of CRVO to prevent future episodes.

Option D, initiating acetylsalicylic acid and no further intervention, is not the correct choice as it does not address the underlying cause of the CRVO. While acetylsalicylic acid may be used in the prevention of cardiovascular events, it is not effective in the management of CRVO.

Therefore, the correct answer is B, performing a thoracoabdominopelvic CT scan, to identify any potential sources of emboli that may have

**Answer**:A. Leiomyosarcoma

The patient's history of hereditary bilateral retinoblastoma and previous radiation therapy increases the likelihood of a soft tissue sarcoma. Leiomyosarcoma is a type of soft tissue sarcoma that arises from the smooth muscle cells in blood vessel walls. The patient's symptoms of unilateral leg swelling and the mass extending into the right common iliac vein, as shown in the computed tomography venogram, are consistent with leiomyosarcoma.

B. Liposarcoma is a type of soft tissue sarcoma that arises from fat cells. While it is possible for liposarcoma to occur in the retroperitoneum, it is less likely given the patient's history of radiation therapy and the absence of fatty infiltration in the Doppler ultrasonography.

C. Angiosarcoma is a type of soft tissue sarcoma that arises from the blood vessels. While it is possible for angiosarcoma to occur in the right common iliac vein, the patient's history of hereditary bilateral retinoblastoma and previous radiation therapy makes leiomyosarcoma a more likely diagnosis.

D. Hemangioendothelioma is a rare type of vascular tumor that can occur in the soft tissues. However, it is unlikely given the patient's history and the absence of any other symptoms or signs suggestive of a vascular tumor.

Therefore, the correct answer is A. Leiomyosarcoma.

**Answer**: C. Parathyroid cyst

The correct answer is C. Parathyroid cyst because it matches the patient's symptoms and test results, which indicate a parathyroid-related lesion.

A. Branchial cleft cyst is an incorrect choice because it is a congenital anomaly that typically presents in childhood, and the patient's age and symptoms do not suggest this diagnosis.

B. Thyroglossal duct cyst is an incorrect choice because it is a type of cyst that forms in the thyroglossal duct during embryonic development, and the patient's symptoms and test results do not support this diagnosis.

D. Cystic thyroid nodule is an incorrect choice because it is a type of thyroid nodule that is usually benign, and the patient's symptoms and test results suggest a parathyroid-related lesion rather than a thyroid nodule.

The patient's symptoms of a right neck mass with compressive symptoms, fatigue, and a normal complete blood cell count, thyroid stimulating hormone test, triiodothyronine and levorotatory thyroxine testing, and complete metabolic panel suggest a parathyroid-related lesion. The ultrasonography and contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan results, which show a large, nonenhancing cystic-appearing lesion abutting the lateral and posterior margins of the right thyroid lobe, also support this diagnosis. The fact that the fine-needle aspiration revealed clear fluid with a parathyroid hormone level of 67 pg/mL (reference range, <100 pg/mL) further supports the diagnosis of a parathyroid cyst.

Therefore, option C, Parathyroid cyst, is the correct answer.

**Answer**:C. Growing teratoma syndrome

The patient's history of recently treated mixed nonseminomatous germ cell tumor (NSGCT) of the right testicle with metastasis to the retroperitoneal and mediastinal lymph nodes, followed by a reduction in metastatic tumor burden and normalization of α-fetoprotein and β-human chorionic gonadotropin after undergoing chemotherapy, suggests that the patient had a malignancy that can produce teratomas. The patient's neck swelling, which initially decreased in size while undergoing chemotherapy, progressively enlarged shortly after concluding treatment, which is consistent with growing teratoma syndrome. Growing teratoma syndrome is a rare complication of germ cell tumors that are treated with chemotherapy. It is characterized by the rapid growth of a teratoma, which is a benign tumor that can arise from the remnants of the primitive germ cells that have not yet differentiated into a specific tissue type. The teratoma can grow rapidly and cause symptoms due to its size and location.

The patient's neck mass, which was demonstrated to be a bulky, cystic left neck mass at levels 3, 4, and 5 on postcontrast coronal MRI and had extensive septations and modularity within the mass on axial CT scan with contrast, is consistent with a teratoma. The patient's history and imaging findings support the diagnosis of growing teratoma syndrome.

A. Latent metastasis from the NSGCT is an incorrect choice because the patient had a reduction in metastatic tumor burden and normalization of α-fetoprotein and β-human chorionic gonadotropin after undergoing chemotherapy, which suggests that the cancer had responded to treatment. The rapid growth of the teratoma after treatment suggests that it is not a metastasis.

B. Supraclavicular lymphocele is an incorrect choice because a lymphocele is a fluid-filled cavity that can develop in the neck after surgery or radiation therapy. The patient did not have a history of surgery or radiation therapy to the neck, and the imag

**Answer**: C. Extramedullary myeloid sarcoma of the larynx

The patient's symptoms of progressive hoarseness and dyspnea, along with the physical examination findings of a severely dysphonic and stridulous voice, and the presence of a right vocal fold neoplasm crossing the posterior commissure, are consistent with a diagnosis of laryngeal cancer. The patient's history of allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) with a matched related donor for treatment of FLT3 internal tandem duplication–mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML) increases the likelihood of a rare complication such as extramedullary myeloid sarcoma (EMS) of the larynx.

EMS is a rare complication that can occur after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), with an incidence of approximately 1% to 2%. It is characterized by the extramedullary proliferation of myeloid cells, which can occur in various tissues, including the larynx. EMS of the larynx is extremely rare, with only a few cases reported in the literature.

The histopathological findings of a diffuse infiltrate of large cells with irregular nuclear contours, vesicular chromatin, and prominent nucleoli, along with the immunohistochemical stains showing CD33, CD43, and CD117 positivity, are consistent with the diagnosis of EMS. The positivity for CD7 and myeloperoxidase and negativity for CD3, CD20, and cytokeratin expression further support this diagnosis.

Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the larynx (choice A) is a common type of laryngeal cancer, but it typically presents with a different clinical picture, with patients often having a long history of smoking and symptoms such as persistent cough, odynophagia, and weight loss. The histopathological findings of SCC are characterized by the presence of keratinizing squamous cells, which are not seen in EMS.

**Answer**:B. Intravascular involvement by NK/T-cell lymphoma

The patient's history of nasal-type natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma, which was diagnosed 2 years prior and treated with pembrolizumab and other chemotherapeutic agents, suggests that the widespread erythematous patches and thin plaques with prominent telangiectases are likely related to the lymphoma. The patient's recent discontinuation of pembrolizumab therapy due to a morbilliform reaction, which had resolved completely 6 to 8 weeks before admission, supports this diagnosis. The absence of other signs of infection or inflammation, such as fever, hypotension, and respiratory symptoms, also suggests that the skin eruption is not likely caused by an opportunistic infection or a side effect of fluconazole treatment for chronic pulmonary coccidiomycosis.

The negative results of blood cultures, β-D-glucan, galactomannan, Coccidioides antibody by complement fixation, and immunodiffusion tests further support the diagnosis of intravascular involvement by NK/T-cell lymphoma, as these tests are typically used to diagnose and monitor infections such as coccidiomycosis. The presence of chronic thrombocytopenia and normocytic anemia also suggests a hematological malignancy such as NK/T-cell lymphoma.

The punch biopsy findings, which showed intravascular atypical cells positive for CD56, are consistent with the diagnosis of intravascular involvement by NK/T-cell lymphoma. The presence of telangiectases and hyperpigmentation in the skin lesions also supports this diagnosis, as these are common findings in cutaneous involvement by NK/T-cell lymphoma.

Therefore, based on the patient's history, clinical presentation, laboratory results, and histopathological findings, the most likely diagnosis is intravascular involvement by NK/T-cell lymphoma.

**Answer**:C. Change the LV pacing configuration

The patient's presentation of worsening cardiomyopathy despite biventricular pacing suggests that the current pacing configuration may not be optimal for the patient's condition. The patient's history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, which led to single-lung transplant, suggests that the patient has a complex cardiac condition that may require tailored management.

Option A, suppressing premature ventricular contractions, may not address the underlying issue of the patient's depressed ejection fraction and may not improve the patient's symptoms.

Option B, increasing the basal pacing rate, may not be appropriate given the patient's depressed ejection fraction and may lead to increased pacing demands and potentially worsen the patient's condition.

Option D, referring for LV lead repositioning, may be necessary if the patient's LV lead is not properly positioned, but it is not the most appropriate next step in the patient's management.

Option C, changing the LV pacing configuration, allows for the optimization of pacing therapy tailored to the patient's specific cardiac condition. This may include adjusting the pacing vector, altering the timing of the pacing stimulus, or implementing a different pacing strategy such as cardiac resynchronization therapy. Changing the LV pacing configuration may help improve the patient's symptoms, increase the patient's exercise tolerance, and potentially improve the patient's ejection fraction.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C, changing the LV pacing configuration.

**Answer**:C. Trigeminal trophic syndrome

The patient's symptoms of multiple progressive ulcers on the right side of his face, burning sensation, and hypoesthesia of the right side of the face, along with the radiological findings of an extensive ischemic posterior circulation stroke involving the right occipital lobe, lower cerebellar peduncle, and pontomedullary boundary, are consistent with Trigeminal trophic syndrome. This syndrome is a rare complication of a stroke that affects the trigeminal nerve and leads to skin ulceration and sensory loss in the distribution of the nerve. The patient's history of unstable angina and recent coronary angiography suggest that the stroke was likely caused by an embolic event.

Giant cell arteritis (choice A) is an inflammatory condition that affects the medium and large arteries, primarily the temporal arteries. It can cause headaches, scalp tenderness, and visual disturbances, but it does not explain the patient's facial ulcers or sensory loss.

Trigeminal herpes zoster (choice B) is a viral infection that affects the trigeminal nerve and causes pain, vesicles, and scarring in the distribution of the nerve. However, the patient's symptoms of facial ulcers and sensory loss are not typical of trigeminal herpes zoster, which usually presents with pain and vesicles on the face.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (choice D) is a rare skin condition characterized by ulcers with a purple-red border and a necrotic base. It is often associated with hematological malignancies or autoimmune disorders. While the patient's facial ulcers share some similarities with pyoderma gangrenosum, the absence of other systemic symptoms and the presence of a stroke suggest that the patient's condition is more likely related to the trigeminal nerve damage caused by the stroke.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Trigeminal trophic syndrome.

**Answer**: D. Check antiphospholipid antibody levels

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a possible diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome, an autoimmune disorder that can cause venous thrombosis and pregnancy complications. The presence of a cotton-wool spot and intraretinal hemorrhage on the right fundus, as well as the peripheral arterial occlusion, are consistent with retinal artery thrombosis. The patient's history of migraine headaches and hypertension also support this diagnosis.

The patient's positive anti-dsDNA and low-titer ANA suggest the possibility of an autoimmune disorder. Antiphospholipid syndrome is known to cause retinal artery thrombosis and aortic valve vegetations, as seen in this patient.

Therefore, checking antiphospholipid antibody levels is the most appropriate next step in the patient's management. If the patient tests positive for antiphospholipid antibodies, it would support the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome and guide further management.

Regarding the other choices:

A. Administer intravenous antibiotics: This choice is not appropriate as there is no evidence of a bacterial infection. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a thrombotic event, which is not typically treated with antibiotics.

B. Administer systemic corticosteroids: Corticosteroids may be considered in the management of antiphospholipid syndrome, but they are not the most appropriate next step. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a thrombotic event, which may not respond to corticosteroids alone.

C. Administer anticoagulant therapy: Anticoagulant therapy may be considered in the management of antiphospholipid syndrome, but it is not the most appropriate next step. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a thrombotic event, which may require immediate treatment with anticoagulants. However, before initiating anticoagulation therapy

**Answer**: D. Ice pack test

The correct answer is D. Ice pack test. The patient's symptoms of right ptosis and limited eye movements, along with the physical examination findings of orthophoria in primary position and reduced orbicularis oculi strength on both sides, suggest a possible diagnosis of a cranial nerve palsy affecting the oculomotor nerve. An ice pack test can help confirm this diagnosis by temporarily alleviating the symptoms of ptosis and diplopia.

The ice pack test involves placing an ice pack on the affected eye for a few minutes, which can temporarily reduce the swelling of the eyelid and improve the mobility of the eye. If the patient experiences relief from the symptoms during the test, it supports the diagnosis of a cranial nerve palsy.

The other choices are not as relevant to the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings:

A. Complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein tests: These tests are used to evaluate for systemic inflammatory conditions, infections, or autoimmune disorders that may affect the nervous system. While they may be useful in certain neurological conditions, they are not specific to the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

B. Computed tomography or magnetic resonance angiography of the head: These imaging studies are used to evaluate for vascular abnormalities, tumors, or other structural lesions in the brain. They may be necessary in certain cases of cranial nerve palsy, but they are not as relevant to the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

C. Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits with contrast: This imaging study is used to evaluate the orbital structures, including the extraocular muscles and the optic nerve. While it may be useful in certain cases of oculomotor nerve palsy, it is not as specific to the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings as the ice pack test.

**Answer**:B. Repeated lumbar puncture with serologies

B. Repeated lumbar puncture with serologies is the correct answer because it is the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic workup of this patient's bilateral optic nerve edema. The patient's history of hypertensive retinopathy and recent onset of painless vision loss in one eye, accompanied by tinnitus and severe intermittent headaches, suggests the possibility of a central nervous system disorder. The normal results of computed tomography and angiography of the head and neck, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits, and lumbar puncture with an opening pressure of 26 cm H2O (normal range, 6 to 25 cm H2O) with elevated protein, make an intracranial disorder less likely. However, the patient's persistent bilateral optic nerve edema and afferent pupillary defect in the right eye, suggest a possible inflammatory or infectious etiology. Repeating the lumbar puncture with serologies, such as antibodies against aquaporin-4, would help to confirm or rule out the diagnosis of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD), which is a rare autoimmune disorder that can cause bilateral optic nerve edema and other neurological symptoms. NMOSD is often associated with antibodies against aquaporin-4, and the presence of these antibodies in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) can support the diagnosis.

A. Advise tighter blood pressure control is not the correct answer because the patient's hypertension is already under control, and there is no evidence to suggest that tightening blood pressure control would address the underlying cause of the patient's bilateral optic nerve edema.

C. Start high-dose corticosteroids is not the correct answer because there is no evidence to support the use of corticosteroids in this case, and corticosteroids may have significant side effects, especially in high doses. Corticosteroids may be considered in the future if the patient's condition worsens or if there is evidence of

**Answer**:C. Send to emergency department for admission and initiation of high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone therapy

Explanation:

The patient's symptoms of severe headaches, progressive bilateral vision loss, and bilateral creamy-yellow lesions in the peripheral retina, along with the absence of any localizing signs, suggest a potentially life-threatening condition such as a central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis or a retinal vasculitis. The patient's age and lack of medical history also increase the likelihood of a severe and aggressive condition.

Option A, sending for infectious and inflammatory tests and following up within 1 week, may not be aggressive enough given the severity of the patient's symptoms and the potential for rapid progression.

Option B, sending for infectious and inflammatory tests, beginning oral prednisone therapy, and following up in 1 week, may be appropriate for some inflammatory conditions, but the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a more severe condition that may require more urgent treatment.

Option D, referring for outpatient neurologic evaluation, may not be appropriate given the severity of the patient's symptoms and the potential for rapid progression.

Therefore, the best answer is option C, sending the patient to the emergency department for admission and initiation of high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone therapy. This approach recognizes the potential severity of the patient's condition and provides prompt and appropriate treatment to prevent further vision loss and potential life-threatening complications.

Sure! Here's my explanation:

**Answer**: C. Acute tubular necrosis secondary to kidney melanoma metastasis

The correct answer is C, Acute tubular necrosis secondary to kidney melanoma metastasis, because the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with this diagnosis.

The patient's acute kidney injury, evidenced by the rapid rise in serum creatinine levels, and the presence of casts in the urine, suggest acute tubular necrosis. The patient's history of metastatic melanoma and the presence of atypical cells in the kidney capillaries on histopathology support the diagnosis of kidney melanoma metastasis.

Immune checkpoint inhibitor–induced acute interstitial nephritis (choice A) is an unlikely diagnosis, as the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not suggest an immune-mediated process. Additionally, the patient's history of melanoma and the presence of metastases in the kidney suggest a more likely explanation for the patient's kidney dysfunction.

Postinfectious glomerulonephritis (choice B) is also an unlikely diagnosis, as there is no evidence of a recent infection or glomerular inflammation.

Drug-induced acute tubular necrosis (choice D) is a possible diagnosis, as the patient was taking several medications that could potentially cause kidney damage. However, the patient's history of melanoma and the presence of metastases in the kidney suggest a more likely explanation for the patient's kidney dysfunction.

Therefore, the correct answer is C, Acute tubular necrosis secondary to kidney melanoma metastasis.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

**Answer**: D. EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer

The correct answer is D. EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer because it most closely matches the patient's symptoms and test results.

The patient presented with a 6-week history of pain and ulcers in the pharynx, which is a symptom commonly associated with EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcers. The patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis and type 2 diabetes also increases the likelihood of an immune-mediated condition such as an EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer.

The physical examination findings, including the large defect involving the entire soft palate on the left, the smooth and clean edges of the soft palate defect, and the absence of any obvious mass or exophytic lesion, are also consistent with an EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer.

The laboratory test results, including the positive IgG for EBV and negative IgM for EBV, support the diagnosis of an EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer. The negative results for lactate dehydrogenase level and autoimmune antibody tests, such as antinuclear antibody and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, also suggest that the patient does not have an autoimmune disorder such as autoimmune vasculitis.

The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, which showed some thickening and hyperenhancement around the edges of the defect, are also consistent with an EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer.

In contrast, nasopharyngeal carcinoma (choice A) is a malignant tumor that typically presents with symptoms such as nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and neck mass. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest a nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

**Answer**: D. Thyroid paraganglioma

The correct answer is D. Thyroid paraganglioma because it best fits the patient's symptoms and test results described in the case.

A. Medullary thyroid carcinoma is an incorrect choice because it typically presents with a different set of symptoms, such as calcitonin elevation, and does not have the characteristic ultrasonography findings described in the case.

B. Papillary thyroid carcinoma is also an incorrect choice because, although it is the most common type of thyroid cancer, it typically presents with a solitary nodule, and the patient's family history and ultrasonography findings do not support this diagnosis.

C. Hyalinizing trabecular tumor is a rare thyroid tumor that typically affects children and young adults. It is not associated with a family history of thyroid cancer, and the patient's symptoms and test results do not support this diagnosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Thyroid paraganglioma, which is a rare tumor that can present with a multinodular goiter and has a similar appearance to papillary thyroid carcinoma on ultrasonography. The patient's family history and the presence of a BRAFV600E variation in the left nodule and lymph node also support this diagnosis.

**Answer**:C. Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma

The correct answer is C. Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma, as it best matches the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

A. Intralymphatic histiocytosis is an incorrect choice because, although it can present with skin lesions, it is a rare condition characterized by the proliferation of histiocytes within lymph vessels, usually without evidence of malignancy. The patient's history of episodic fever and the presence of telangiectasias on the lower limbs do not support this diagnosis.

B. Reactive angioendotheliomatosis is an incorrect choice because it is a rare condition characterized by the proliferation of endothelial cells and inflammatory cells within blood vessels, usually in response to an underlying inflammatory condition. The patient's lack of known benign inflammatory conditions and the absence of other symptoms make this diagnosis less likely.

D. Intralymphatic proliferation of T-cell lymphoid blasts is an incorrect choice because it is a rare condition characterized by the proliferation of T cells within lymph vessels, usually in the context of T-cell malignancies. The patient's age and the presence of B cells in the skin biopsy specimen make this diagnosis less likely.

C. Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma is the correct answer because it is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma characterized by the proliferation of large B cells within blood vessels. The patient's symptoms, including episodic fever and painless cutaneous lesions, are consistent with this diagnosis. The presence of telangiectasias on the lower limbs and the results of the skin biopsy, showing large round cells proliferating within dermal blood vessels, also support this diagnosis. The patient's age and the slightly elevated C-reactive protein levels are also consistent with this diagnosis.

**Answer**: D. Blau syndrome

Blau syndrome is a rare autoinflammatory disorder characterized by the combination of skin and joint symptoms, which fits the patient's presentation of ichthyosiform rashes, joint pain, and uveitis. The histopathologic findings of noncaseating granulomas with multinucleated giant cells and neutrophil infiltration in the dermis and subcutis are also consistent with Blau syndrome.

Ichthyosis vulgaris (choice A) is a common genetic disorder characterized by dry, scaly skin. While it can present with erythematous papules and plaques, the absence of trichorrhexis invaginata or trichorrhexis nodosa on hair examination makes this diagnosis less likely.

Netherton syndrome (choice B) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by a distinctive skin phenotype, including ichthyosiform scaling, atopic diathesis, and a high risk of developing allergies, asthma, and food allergies. However, the presence of joint pain and uveitis suggests a different diagnosis.

Pityriasis rubra pilaris (choice C) is a chronic skin condition characterized by reddish-orange, scaly plaques on the scalp, beard, and pubic area. While it can present with erythematous papules and plaques, the absence of a characteristic scalp involvement and the presence of joint pain and uveitis make this diagnosis less likely.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and histopathologic findings, the most likely diagnosis is Blau syndrome.

**Answer**:C. Administer bisoprolol

The patient in the case presented has symptoms and signs of cardiogenic shock, including hypotension, tachypnea, and diffuse ST-segment elevation on the electrocardiogram (ECG). The patient's history of recent physical and emotional stress, dizziness, and exertional dyspnea suggests that the cardiogenic shock is likely caused by a myocardial infarction (MI).

The correct answer, C. Administer bisoprolol, is chosen because bisoprolol is a beta-blocker that can help to reduce the heart's workload and decrease the risk of further myocardial damage. In patients with acute MI, beta-blockers have been shown to improve survival and reduce the risk of future cardiovascular events.

In contrast, the other answer choices are not appropriate for the patient's current condition:

A. Administer dobutamine: Dobutamine is a dopamine agonist that can increase the heart's contractility, which may be beneficial in some cases of cardiogenic shock. However, in this patient's case, the use of dobutamine may exacerbate the myocardial infarction by increasing the heart's workload and oxygen demand.

B. Administer nitrates and nifedipine: Nitrates and nifedipine are both vasodilators that can help to reduce blood pressure and improve perfusion to the myocardium. However, in this patient's case, the use of vasodilators may not address the underlying cause of the cardiogenic shock (myocardial infarction) and may even worsen the patient's hypotension.

D. Start an intra-aortic balloon pump: An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) is a mechanical device that can help to increase blood flow to the myocardium by inflating a balloon in the aorta during diastole. While an IABP may be considered in some cases of cardiogenic shock, it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient's condition. The patient's diffuse ST-segment

D. Begin valganciclovir therapy and sample intraocular fluid for polymerase chain reaction testing is the correct answer.

The patient's symptoms of painless central scotoma and worsening floaters, along with the physical examination findings of a white macular lesion, disc edema, and scattered intraretinal and peripapillary hemorrhages, suggest a diagnosis of acute retinal necrosis (ARN). ARN is a severe and sight-threatening infection that requires prompt treatment.

Option A, performing a vitreous tap and injection of intravitreal antibiotics, may be considered as a treatment option for ARN, but it is not the most appropriate first step in management. Intravitreal antibiotics may not penetrate the retina effectively in the presence of a dense epiretinal membrane, as seen in this case. Moreover, vitreous tap may not provide a sufficient sample for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, which is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of ARN.

Option B, reviewing medical records to see if gentamicin was given intraoperatively, is not relevant to the patient's current condition and does not address the urgency of the situation.

Option C, urgently referring the patient to the emergency department for embolic stroke workup, is not appropriate as the patient does not present with symptoms suggestive of a stroke.

Therefore, the best course of action is to begin valganciclovir therapy and sample intraocular fluid for PCR testing to confirm the diagnosis of ARN and guide further management. Valganciclovir is an oral antiviral medication that has been shown to be effective in treating ARN, and PCR testing can help identify the specific viral cause of the infection.

**Answer**:C. Obtain an anterior-segment optical coherence tomogram

The correct answer is C. Obtain an anterior-segment optical coherence tomogram because it provides a non-invasive imaging modality that can help in evaluating the corneal edema and identifying any potential causes, such as irregular astrocyte deposits or corneal thickening. This information is crucial in determining the appropriate management for the patient's condition.

Option A, Perform penetrating keratoplasty, is incorrect because it is an invasive surgical procedure that involves replacing the entire cornea, which may not be necessary at this stage. The patient's corneal edema may be managed with less invasive measures, such as medication or endothelial keratoplasty.

Option B, Provide medical management with topical corticosteroids and hypertonic saline solution for an additional 3 months, may help reduce inflammation and improve corneal edema, but it does not provide a definitive diagnosis or guide further management.

Option D, Perform an endothelial keratoplasty (Descemet stripping and endothelial keratoplasty or Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty), is incorrect because it is a surgical procedure that involves replacing the endothelial layer of the cornea, which may not be necessary at this stage. Moreover, it is not clear whether the patient's corneal edema is caused by endothelial dysfunction, and this procedure may not address the underlying cause of the edema.

**Answer**:B. Diagnostic anterior chamber paracentesis and intravitreal foscarnet

Explanation:

The patient presents with acute unilateral painless vision loss, purpuric rash, and digital ischemia, which suggests a possible diagnosis of frosted branch angiitis, a type of retinal vasculitis. The patient's history of immunosuppression and recent initiation of azathioprine therapy also support this diagnosis.

The correct answer is B, diagnostic anterior chamber paracentesis and intravitreal foscarnet. Anterior chamber paracentesis is a diagnostic procedure that involves removing a small sample of fluid from the anterior chamber of the eye to evaluate for inflammatory cells, bacteria, or other abnormalities. Intravitreal foscarnet is a medication that is used to treat certain eye infections, including retinal vasculitis, by reducing inflammation and preventing further tissue damage.

Option A, escalating systemic immunosuppression, may be considered as a next step in management, but it is not the most appropriate choice at this time. The patient's current symptoms and examination findings suggest a more urgent need for diagnostic testing and treatment of the retinal vasculitis, rather than simply escalating immunosuppression.

Option C, peripheral blood smear and flow cytometry, may be useful in evaluating for systemic infections or hematological disorders, but it is not directly related to the patient's current ocular symptoms and retinal findings.

Option D, whole-body positron emission tomography–computed tomography, is a diagnostic imaging study that may be useful in evaluating for certain systemic conditions, but it is not specifically indicated for the patient's current symptoms and retinal findings.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to perform diagnostic anterior chamber paracentesis and intravitreal foscarnet to evaluate and treat the patient's retinal vasculitis.

**Answer**: A. Aleukemic cutaneous myeloid sarcoma

The correct diagnosis is aleukemic cutaneous myeloid sarcoma because the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory results are consistent with this diagnosis.

Aleukemic cutaneous myeloid sarcoma is a rare type of cancer that affects the skin and subcutaneous tissue. It is characterized by the rapid growth of numerous skin nodules, which can be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, as in this patient's case. The nodules are typically erythematous, indurated, and can involve the head, neck, torso, and extremities, as seen in this patient.

The patient's laboratory results also support this diagnosis. An elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase level is consistent with aleukemic cutaneous myeloid sarcoma, as it suggests increased cellular turnover and proliferation. Additionally, the patient's complete blood cell count with differential results were normal, which is consistent with this diagnosis, as aleukemic cutaneous myeloid sarcoma does not typically affect the blood cells.

The skin biopsy findings also support this diagnosis, as they demonstrate diffuse dermal infiltrates extending to the subcutis, with sparing of the upper papillary dermis. The infiltrates are characterized by immature myeloid cells, which is consistent with aleukemic cutaneous myeloid sarcoma.

The other choices are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

B. Cutaneous lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the skin and can cause skin lesions, but it typically presents with ulceration, scaling, or crusting, which is not seen in this patient's case. Additionally, cutaneous lymphoma typically affects the lymph nodes, which is not mentioned in this patient's case.

**Answer**:C. Sclerosing polycystic adenoma

The correct answer is C. Sclerosing polycystic adenoma, as it best matches the patient's symptoms and the histopathological findings described in the case. Here's why the other choices are incorrect:

A. Acinic cell carcinoma: Acinic cell carcinoma is a malignant tumor that arises from the acinar cells of the salivary glands. Although it is a possibility for a parotid mass, the histopathological findings do not support this diagnosis. The case describes a multilobulated, complex lesion with prominent stromal fibrosis and collections of ductal structures with varying degrees of cystic change, which is not consistent with the characteristic histopathological features of acinic cell carcinoma.

B. Mammary analog secretory carcinoma: Mammary analog secretory carcinoma is a rare type of salivary gland cancer that is histologically similar to breast cancer. It is characterized by the presence of secretory-type cells and/or lactation-like cells. The histopathological findings described in the case do not support this diagnosis, as there are no features of secretory-type cells or lactation-like cells.

D. Myoepithelial carcinoma: Myoepithelial carcinoma is a malignant tumor that arises from the myoepithelial cells of the salivary glands. It is characterized by the presence of clear cells with a myoepithelial appearance. The histopathological findings described in the case do not support this diagnosis, as there are no features of clear cells with a myoepithelial appearance.

C. Sclerosing polycystic adenoma: Sclerosing polycystic adenoma is a rare benign tumor of the salivary glands, characterized by a multilobulated, complex lesion with prominent stromal fibrosis and collections of ductal structures with varying degrees of cystic change.

**Answer**: C. Cytomegalovirus infection

The correct answer is C. Cytomegalovirus infection because the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with this diagnosis. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common viral infection that can cause a wide range of symptoms, including perianal ulcers, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia. The patient's history of recent kidney transplantation and immunosuppressive therapy increases the risk of CMV infection. The presence of large fibroblasts and endothelial cells with glassy cytoplasm and intranuclear inclusions on histopathologic examination of the biopsy specimen is consistent with CMV infection.

Amebiasis cutis (choice A) is unlikely because the patient does not have a history of travel to an area where amebiasis is endemic, and there is no evidence of intestinal amebiasis. Herpes simplex virus infection (choice B) is also unlikely because the patient does not have a history of herpes simplex virus infection, and the ulcers do not have the characteristic appearance of herpes simplex virus lesions. Cutaneous Crohn disease (choice D) is unlikely because the patient does not have a history of inflammatory bowel disease, and there is no evidence of gastrointestinal symptoms.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is C. Cytomegalovirus infection.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain why C. Lupus vulgaris is the correct answer and why the other choices are incorrect.

**Answer**: C. Lupus vulgaris

Lupus vulgaris is a type of cutaneous tuberculosis that occurs when Mycobacterium tuberculosis infects the skin. The patient's symptoms of a persistently enlarged and edematous auricle, foul-smelling otorrhea, and the presence of tuberculoid granulomas on biopsy are all consistent with lupus vulgaris. The fact that the patient had immigrated to Israel 9 years before admission and had a negative Mantoux test result suggests that the infection was likely acquired in Israel, where tuberculosis is not as prevalent as in some other parts of the world.

**Answer**: A. Lupus pernio

Lupus pernio is a type of cutaneous tuberculosis that occurs when Mycobacterium tuberculosis infects the skin and causes a chronic, indolent, and painless nodule. While the patient's symptoms of an enlarged and edematous auricle and the presence of tuberculoid granulomas on biopsy are consistent with lupus pernio, the patient's history of a persistently enlarged auricle for 5 decades and the presence of foul-smelling otorrhea are not typical of lupus pernio.

**Answer**: B. Granulomatous mycosis fungoides

Granulomatous mycosis fungoides is a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that can mimic tuberculosis. However, the patient's history of a persistently enlarged auricle for 5 decades and the presence of tuberculoid granulomas on biopsy are not consistent with granulomatous mycosis fungoides. Additionally, the patient's negative Mantoux test result suggests that the infection was not caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

**Answer**:C. Electrophysiology study with or without catheter ablation

The correct answer is C. Electrophysiology study with or without catheter ablation, because it is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's condition.

A. Therapeutic abstention and patient reassurance may be appropriate for some patients with benign arrhythmias, but it is not the best choice in this case given the patient's symptoms and the wide QRS complex rhythm observed on the electrocardiogram.

B. Medical therapy with propafenone or flecainide may be effective in managing some types of arrhythmias, but it is not the most appropriate choice in this case because the patient's arrhythmia is not typical of a supraventricular tachycardia, which is the most common indication for these medications.

D. Medical therapy with β-blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil may be effective in managing some types of arrhythmias, but it is not the most appropriate choice in this case because the patient's arrhythmia is not typical of a supraventricular tachycardia, and these medications may not be effective in managing a wide QRS complex rhythm.

C. Electrophysiology study with or without catheter ablation is the most appropriate next step because it allows for a definitive diagnosis of the arrhythmia mechanism and may provide a curative treatment option. The wide QRS complex rhythm observed on the electrocardiogram suggests a possible ventricular arrhythmia, which may be amenable to catheter ablation. Additionally, an electrophysiology study can help to rule out other arrhythmia mechanisms and guide further management.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is C. Measure serum niacin level.

Niacin, also known as vitamin B3, is an essential nutrient that plays a crucial role in energy metabolism and the maintenance of healthy skin, hair, and nails. The patient's symptoms of diarrhea and pruritic rash suggest a possible deficiency in niacin. A low serum niacin level could indicate a deficiency, which could be caused by a number of factors, including poor diet, malabsorption, or increased demand due to certain medical conditions. Measuring the patient's serum niacin level would help to confirm or rule out a niacin deficiency, which could guide further management and treatment decisions.

Now, let's discuss why the other answer choices are incorrect.

A. Measure fecal calprotectin level: Fecal calprotectin is a protein produced by the inflamed intestinal mucosa and is often elevated in inflammatory bowel diseases, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. While it's possible that the patient's diarrhea could be related to an inflammatory bowel disease, the patient's age and symptoms suggest a different etiology. Moreover, measuring fecal calprotectin level would not specifically help in diagnosing a niacin deficiency.

B. Check for fecal ova and parasites: This choice is not relevant to the patient's symptoms or potential diagnosis. Fecal ova and parasites are typically checked when there is a suspicion of intestinal parasitosis or infection, which is not suggested by the patient's symptoms or history.

D. Test for serum antitissue transglutaminase antibody: Tissue transglutaminase antibodies are often elevated in celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder that affects the small intestine and is characterized by a reaction to gluten. While celiac disease could potentially cause diarrhea and malabsorption, the patient's age and symptoms do not suggest this diagnosis. Moreover, measuring

**Answer**: D. Obtain serum vitamin levels.

The patient's new larger epithelial defect and subepithelial bullae in an adjacent location, along with the presence of dull conjunctival reflexes and bulbar conjunctival lesions in both eyes, suggest a possible vitamin deficiency. Vitamin deficiencies, particularly vitamin A and B12, can cause corneal epithelial defects and conjunctival lesions. The patient's history of alcohol use disorder increases the likelihood of a vitamin deficiency, as alcohol can interfere with the absorption of vitamins from the diet.

Therefore, obtaining serum vitamin levels is the most appropriate next step in the patient's management. This will help to identify any potential vitamin deficiencies and guide appropriate treatment.

In contrast, continuing treatment with current topical antibiotics (choice A) may not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, and may not be effective in promoting healing of the corneal epithelial defect. Repeating the corneal cultures with Lowenstein-Jensen medium (choice B) may not provide additional information that would change management, as the patient's corneal cultures have already grown Streptococcus pneumonia. Obtaining serum anti-Ro and anti-La tests (choice C) may be useful in diagnosing autoimmune diseases such as Sjögren's syndrome, but is not directly related to the patient's current symptoms and vitamin deficiency suspicion. Obtaining serum vitamin levels is a more targeted and appropriate step at this point in the patient's management.

**Answer**:C. Perform extraocular muscle biopsy

The patient's symptoms and examination findings, such as bilateral proptosis, conjunctival erythema, chemosis, and bilateral lower eyelid retraction, suggest a diagnosis of bilateral extraocular muscle enlargement. The patient's history of hypothyroidism and hematologic malignancies increases the likelihood of an orbital inflammatory or neoplastic process.

Option A, prescribing high-dose intravenous steroids, may be appropriate for conditions such as orbital inflammation or thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's history of hematologic malignancies and the absence of thyroid-related antibodies or inflammatory markers suggest that steroids may not be effective in treating the underlying condition.

Option B, performing staged bilateral orbital decompressions, may be necessary in cases of severe proptosis or vision loss, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's visual acuity, color vision, and pupillary responses are normal, and there is no evidence of compressive optic neuropathy.

Option D, referring for bilateral orbital external beam radiation, may be appropriate for cases of orbital lymphoma, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's history of hematologic malignancies and the absence of any evidence of lymphoma on imaging suggest that radiation therapy may not be necessary at this time.

Option C, performing extraocular muscle biopsy, is the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's bilateral extraocular muscle enlargement is unusual and warrants further investigation. A muscle biopsy can help establish a diagnosis of an inflammatory or neoplastic process and guide further management. The biopsy can also help rule out other potential causes of extraocular muscle enlargement, such as myositis or myopathy.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Perform extraocular muscle

**Answer**:C. Perform a vitrectomy with cytology and immunohistochemistry

The patient's symptoms of worsening floaters, decreased visual acuity, and cystoid macular edema (CME) in both eyes, along with the findings of vitreous cells and floaters on dilated fundus examination, suggest a possible vitreoretinal pathology. The patient's history of hypertension and trigeminal neuralgia may also be relevant to the patient's overall health and potential treatment plan, but they do not directly explain the patient's current symptoms.

Option A, reassuring the patient and doing nothing, is not appropriate given the patient's symptoms and findings. The patient's symptoms have worsened over time, and the presence of CME and vitreous cells suggests that there is an underlying issue that needs to be addressed.

Option B, giving an intravitreal anti-VEGF injection, may be a reasonable treatment option for the patient's CME, but it is not the most appropriate choice at this time. While anti-VEGF injections can be effective in treating CME, they are typically used as a second-line treatment after other potential causes of CME have been ruled out. In this case, the patient's symptoms and findings suggest a possible vitreoretinal pathology, and further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of the CME.

Option D, recommending a temporal craniotomy with a brain biopsy, is not directly related to the patient's symptoms or findings. While the patient's history of trigeminal neuralgia may suggest a possible neurological component to their symptoms, the patient's visual symptoms and fundus findings suggest a more likely vitreoretinal etiology. A temporal craniotomy with a brain biopsy would not be an appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation and treatment.

Option C, performing a vitrectomy with cytology and immunohistochemistry, is the most appropriate choice at this time. A vitrectomy would allow for the removal of the vitreous gel and any associated cells or debris that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. The cytology and immunoh

**Answer**:C. Start systemic corticosteroids

The correct answer is C. Start systemic corticosteroids, as it is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's condition.

Let's examine each answer choice in detail:

A. Begin intravenous vancomycin and cefepime:
This choice is incorrect because there is no indication for antibiotics in this scenario. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a non-infectious process, and there is no evidence of an orbital infection. Intravenous antibiotics may be considered in cases of suspected orbital cellulitis or abscess, but that is not the case here.

B. Perform examination under anesthesia:
This choice is incorrect because the patient's condition is not severe enough to warrant an examination under anesthesia. The patient is awake and alert, and there is no evidence of a life-threatening condition that would require immediate intervention. An examination under anesthesia may be considered in cases of severe orbital trauma or when the patient's condition is unstable, but that is not the case here.

D. Observe:
This choice is incorrect because the patient's condition warrants active management. The patient has significant periorbital swelling and erythema, which may indicate an allergic or inflammatory response to the intra-arterial chemotherapy. The patient's symptoms and examination findings also suggest a possible adverse reaction to the chemotherapy, which requires prompt intervention. Observing the patient without any intervention may lead to a delay in appropriate management and potentially worsen the patient's condition.

C. Start systemic corticosteroids:
This choice is correct because corticosteroids can help reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms associated with the patient's condition. The patient's periorbital swelling and erythema may be related to an allergic or inflammatory response to the intra-arterial chemotherapy, and corticosteroids can help reduce this inflammation and prevent further complications. Additionally, corticosteroids may help reduce the risk of further vision loss due to

Sure! Here's my explanation:

**Answer**: C. Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis

The patient's symptoms, such as tender, erythematous plaques and nodules on the palms, soles, and lower trunk, are consistent with neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis (NEH). NEH is a rare adverse event associated with chemotherapy, and it is characterized by a neutrophilic infiltrate surrounding eccrine glands. The patient's history of acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage and recent exposure to chemotherapy, including fludarabine, cytarabine, and filgrastim, increases the likelihood of NEH.

The patient's allergy to cashew nuts and previous episode of urticaria during a platelet transfusion may also contribute to the development of NEH. The patient's medications, such as ondansetron, aprepitant, prednisolone, and oxycodone, are not typically associated with NEH.

Sweet syndrome (Answer A) is a rare adverse event associated with chemotherapy, characterized by fever, leukocytosis, and a painful, edematous, and erythematous rash. While the patient's fever and leukocytosis are consistent with Sweet syndrome, the absence of a painful rash and the presence of neutrophilic infiltrate surrounding eccrine glands argue against this diagnosis.

Urticaria (Answer B) is an allergic reaction characterized by itchy, raised welts on the skin. While the patient had a history of urticaria during a platelet transfusion, the absence of pruritus and the presence of neutrophilic infiltrate surrounding eccrine glands argue against this diagnosis.

Leukemia cutis (Answer D) is a rare condition characterized by the infiltration of leukemic cells into the skin. While the patient's history of acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage increases the likelihood of leukemia cutis, the absence of skin lesions consistent with leukemia cutis and the presence of neutrophilic infil

**Answer**: B. Spontaneous lymphorrhea

The patient's symptoms, such as sudden onset of bilateral neck swelling, painless swelling, and a rash, are consistent with spontaneous lymphorrhea. Additionally, the CT scan results show a large retropharyngeal fluid accumulation that extended laterally to the vascular spaces, which is also consistent with this diagnosis.

Cervical necrotizing fasciitis (A) is an infection of the deep soft tissues of the neck, which can cause swelling and pain. However, the patient did not report any pain or fever, and the CT scan did not show any signs of infection or inflammation.

Angioneurotic edema (C) is a rare condition that causes sudden swelling of the face, neck, or limbs due to an allergic reaction. However, the patient did not report any history of allergies or triggers, and the CT scan did not show any signs of allergic reaction.

Quincke edema (D) is a rare condition that causes swelling of the face, neck, or limbs due to an allergic reaction. Like Angioneurotic edema, it is not consistent with the patient's symptoms or CT scan results.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Spontaneous lymphorrhea.

Sure! Here's my explanation:

**Answer**: D. Spontaneous airway hemorrhage with obstructive hematoma

The patient's symptoms of dyspnea, dysphonia, dysphagia, and neck swelling, along with the physical examination findings of ecchymosis of the lateral left neck and submandibular region, and the contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan results, are consistent with a diagnosis of spontaneous airway hemorrhage with obstructive hematoma.

The patient's history of factor V Leiden deficiency and anticoagulation therapy increases the likelihood of bleeding complications. The ecchymosis in the lateral neck and submandibular region suggests that the bleeding is likely coming from a vessel in the neck, which is supported by the CT scan findings of a large, intermediate-density, modestly enhancing, left-sided submucosal lesion extending from the nasopharynx inferiorly to the glottis with encroachment on the airway.

Flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy demonstrated a large submucosal mass extending from the left posteroinferior nasopharyngeal wall to the left lateral and posterior pharyngeal walls, obstructing the view of the left supraglottis, glottis, and piriform sinus. This suggests that the bleeding has formed a hematoma that is obstructing the airway, which is consistent with the diagnosis of spontaneous airway hemorrhage with obstructive hematoma.

The other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and findings.

* Abscess (choice A) is unlikely because the patient does not have signs of infection such as fever, chills, or neck stiffness. Additionally, the CT scan findings do not suggest an abscess.
* Head and neck malignant neoplasm(s) (choice B) is unlikely because the patient's symptoms are more consistent with an acute airway obstruction, and the CT scan findings do not suggest a mass consistent with a malignancy.
* Angioedema (choice C) is unlikely

**Answer**:B. Idiopathic follicular mucinosis

The correct answer is B, Idiopathic follicular mucinosis, because it matches the clinical and histopathological features described in the case.

Idiopathic follicular mucinosis is a rare benign condition characterized by the proliferation of mucin-secreting cells in the follicular epithelium, leading to the formation of multiple small, skin-colored or erythematous papules, often arranged in a linear or segmental pattern. The condition typically affects children and young adults, and the lesions are usually distributed on the face, particularly on the forehead, nose, and cheeks.

The clinical presentation of the case, with multiple skin-colored and erythematous follicular papules arranged in a linear distribution on the face, and the absence of mucosal lesions, is consistent with idiopathic follicular mucinosis. The histopathological features shown in Figure 1B and C, with numerous small, dilated follicles filled with mucin and surrounded by a patchy lymphocytic infiltrate, are also typical of the condition.

In contrast, Lichen striatus (choice A) is an inflammatory condition characterized by the formation of linear, grouped, or coalescent papules on the skin, often accompanied by itching and scaling. While it can affect children, the lesions are typically more widespread and not limited to the face. Follicular mucinous nevus (choice C) is a rare benign tumor that presents as a single or multiple skin-colored or pigmented papules, often on the face, but it is not associated with a linear distribution or mucin secretion. Trichodysplasia spinulosa (choice D) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormal differentiation of hair follicles, leading to the formation of small, rough, skin-colored papules on the face and body, but it is not associated with mucin secretion or a linear distribution.

Therefore, based on the clinical and histopathological features described in the case, the most appropriate diagnosis is idiopathic fol

**Answer**:B. Neurocristic hamartoma

**Explanation**:
The correct diagnosis is B. Neurocristic hamartoma, as it matches the clinical and histopathological features described in the case.

A. Becker nevus does not fit the clinical presentation of a slow-growing, nontender plaque on the lower back, and there is no mention of a preceding inflammatory phase, which is characteristic of Becker nevi.

C. Smooth muscle hamartoma is an uncommon benign tumor that typically presents as a small, firm nodule on the trunk or extremities. It is not associated with hypertrichosis or a multinodular plaque.

D. Plexiform neurofibroma is a type of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) that presents as a soft, pedunculated, or pendulous mass, usually on the head, neck, or trunk. It is not associated with hypertrichosis or a multinodular plaque.

In contrast, neurocristic hamartoma (NCH) is a rare benign tumor that typically presents as a slowly growing, painless, pedunculated or sessile mass on the trunk or extremities. NCH is characterized by a mix of partially fusiform melanocytes and dendritic cells with glassy, eosinophilic cytoplasm, which is consistent with the histopathological findings described in the case. The presence of hypertrichosis and a multinodular plaque also supports the diagnosis of NCH.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Neurocristic hamartoma.

**Answer**:A. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic workup of this patient's rapidly growing right atrial mass. MRI offers several advantages over other imaging modalities in this scenario.

Firstly, MRI provides excellent soft tissue resolution, which is essential for evaluating the morphology and extent of the right atrial mass. This is particularly important in this case, as the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a potentially life-threatening condition, such as a malignancy or an infectious process. MRI can help to accurately diagnose and stage the mass, which is crucial for determining the appropriate course of treatment.

Secondly, MRI can assess cardiac function and identify any areas of myocardial damage or dysfunction. The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, fatigue, and weight loss, along with the abnormal cardiac mechanics revealed by 2-dimensional speckle-tracking strain, suggest that there may be underlying myocardial disease. MRI can help to identify areas of fibrosis, inflammation, or scar tissue, which can guide management decisions.

Thirdly, MRI can provide information on the vasculature and potential vascular involvement of the mass. This is particularly important in the context of a rapidly growing mass, as it may indicate a malignant process that requires urgent treatment.

In contrast, positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT) may also be useful in evaluating the mass, but it is not the most appropriate next step. While PET-CT can provide information on metabolic activity, it may not be able to accurately diagnose the mass or assess cardiac function.

Right heart catheterization for biopsy (choice C) is an invasive procedure that carries risks, including bleeding, infection, and arrhythmias. In this case, given the patient's symptoms and the findings on transthoracic echocardiogram, it is more appropriate to pursue a non-invasive imaging modality, such as MRI, before considering a biopsy.

**Answer**:C. Order lower extremity duplex ultrasound

The correct answer is C. Order lower extremity duplex ultrasound because it is the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic workup of the patient's symptoms.

The patient presents with a rash on the right foot, accompanied by fever, diaphoresis, and headaches, which suggests a possible vasculitic process. The fact that the rash fades when the leg is elevated above the level of the heart suggests that it may be related to decreased blood flow or venous insufficiency.

A lower extremity duplex ultrasound would help to evaluate the blood flow and venous return in the affected limb, which could help to confirm or rule out a diagnosis of vasculitis or venous insufficiency. This test is non-invasive and can provide valuable information that would guide further management.

Antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, and complement levels (Answer B) may be useful in the workup of certain autoimmune disorders, but they are not specifically indicated in this case given the patient's symptoms and medical history.

Skin biopsy (Answer A) may be necessary later in the workup, but it is not the most appropriate next step. It would be more appropriate to perform a biopsy after other diagnostic tests have been completed and a specific diagnosis has been made.

Antibiotic therapy (Answer D) is not indicated at this time, as there is no evidence of an active infection.

Therefore, the best answer is C. Order lower extremity duplex ultrasound.

**Answer**: D. Prescribe oral zinc therapy

The correct answer is D. Prescribe oral zinc therapy, as the patient's history of a red blood cell transfusion as a child and positive hepatitis C virus (HCV) status suggest a possible diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis, which would require systemic treatment with antibiotics and supportive care. Oral zinc therapy may also be beneficial in treating any underlying immune dysfunction that may be contributing to the patient's condition.

A. Perform incisional biopsy would not be the next step, as the patient has already undergone a punch biopsy, which revealed psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia, parakeratosis, eosinophils, papillary dermal inflammation, and intraepidermal necrosis, and the diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis is already suspected.

B. Prescribe amoxicillin/clavulanic acid would not be the next step, as the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest a bacterial infection, and the patient's history of HCV increases the risk of bacterial resistance to antibiotics.

C. Order computed tomography (CT) scan of  abdomen and pelvis would not be the next step, as the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest any abdominal or pelvic pathology, and a CT scan would not provide any additional information to guide management of the patient's foot lesions.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is C. Reassure and address patient’s concerns and follow up in 1 year.

Let's go through each answer choice and explain why it's incorrect or correct:

A. Obtain a brain fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scan.

While a brain FDG-PET scan can be useful in evaluating cognitive decline, it's not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's symptoms and examination results are not consistent with Alzheimer's disease, and the genetic test result does not confirm the diagnosis. A brain FDG-PET scan would not provide additional information that would change management at this point.

B. Order cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) testing for Alzheimer disease biomarkers.

CSF testing for Alzheimer disease biomarkers is a useful diagnostic tool, but it's not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's symptoms and examination results do not suggest Alzheimer's disease, and the genetic test result does not confirm the diagnosis. CSF testing would not provide additional information that would change management at this point.

D. Refer for genetic counseling.

While genetic counseling may be helpful for patients with positive genetic test results, it's not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's genetic test result does not confirm the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, and there are no other indications for genetic counseling.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to reassure and address the patient's concerns and follow up in 1 year. This approach acknowledges the patient's symptoms and provides an opportunity for further evaluation and management if necessary. It also allows for ongoing monitoring and support for the patient.

**Answer**:C. Order an electrocardiogram

The correct answer is C. Order an electrocardiogram because the patient's symptoms of bilateral ptosis and ophthalmoplegia, along with the physical examination findings of a margin reflex distance of -4 mm OU and a levator function of 0 OU, suggest a possible diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder that affects the nervous system and can cause weakness or paralysis of the extraocular muscles, leading to ptosis and ophthalmoplegia.

An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a non-invasive test that measures the electrical activity of the heart and can help identify any abnormalities in the heart's electrical conduction system. In the case of myasthenia gravis, an ECG can help identify any changes in the heart's electrical activity that may be indicative of the disease.

Option A, perform surgical repair of ptosis with frontalis sling, is not the next step in management as it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

Option B, order neuroimaging with magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits with and without contrast, may be considered in the future to rule out other causes of bilateral ptosis and ophthalmoplegia, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this time.

Option D, investigate for thyroid eye disease, is not relevant to the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

**Answer**:A. Lumbar puncture

The correct answer is A. Lumbar puncture. The patient's symptoms of headache, vomiting, and blurry vision, along with the physical examination findings of bilateral abduction deficits and bilateral optic disc swelling with obscuration of all borders, suggest a possible diagnosis of meningitis or encephalitis. A lumbar puncture would be the next step in the diagnostic workup to confirm the diagnosis and determine the cause of the symptoms.

Initiation of anticoagulation (B) may be appropriate if the patient is diagnosed with a thrombotic event, such as a sigmoid sinus thrombosis, but it is not the next step in the diagnostic workup.

Ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement (C) is not indicated in this case, as there is no evidence of hydrocephalus or increased intracranial pressure.

High-dose intravenous steroids (D) may be considered in the treatment of certain inflammatory conditions, such as optic neuritis, but they are not the next step in the diagnostic workup for this patient's symptoms.

**Answer**:B. Genetic sequencing

The case presented is a 35-year-old man with a history of hypertension, painless vision loss for 6 years, and a recent episode of seizure. The patient's family history includes a sibling with uremia and a parent who died of kidney failure. The patient's examination revealed mild cognitive impairment, and the results of fundus fluorescein angiography and enhanced MRI of the brain showed retinal vasculitis and multiple ring-enhancing lesions, respectively. The patient's laboratory results showed kidney insufficiency, and whole-body PET/CT imaging did not detect any hypermetabolic changes.

Given the patient's symptoms and family history, it is important to consider a genetic cause for his condition. Choice B, genetic sequencing, is the most appropriate next step in the patient's workup. Genetic sequencing can help identify potential genetic causes of the patient's retinal vasculitis and kidney disease, such as genetic mutations associated with systemic lupus erythematosus or other autoimmune disorders.

On the other hand, choice A, brain or kidney biopsy, may not be necessary at this point in the patient's workup. While a biopsy could provide more information about the nature of the ring-enhancing lesions, it is not the most appropriate next step given the patient's symptoms and family history.

Choice C, second CSF culture, is unlikely to provide additional information that would change the patient's management. The patient's CSF profiling, including cytologic analysis, was already normal, and there is no indication of a bacterial or fungal infection.

Choice D, aqueous humor paracentesis, is not relevant to the patient's current condition and is not necessary at this time.

Therefore, the correct answer is B, genetic sequencing.

**Answer**:A. Discuss superficial keratectomy to confirm the diagnosis by histopathologic examination

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of painless, progressive blurring of vision in his left eye, along with the grayish cornea opacity observed during slitlamp examination, suggest the possibility of a corneal tumor. The absence of conjunctival erythema or appreciable feeder vessels at the limbus, as well as the unremarkable fundus examination findings, further support this diagnosis.

Superficial keratectomy is a surgical procedure that involves removing the diseased corneal epithelium and some of the underlying stroma. This procedure can help to confirm the diagnosis of a corneal tumor by allowing for histopathologic examination of the removed tissue. In this case, the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest that a superficial keratectomy may be necessary to determine the cause of the corneal opacity and to provide appropriate treatment.

Observation with follow-up for changes over the next 6 to 12 months (choice D) may not be the most appropriate option at this time, as the patient's symptoms have already been present for several months, and the lesion appears to be progressing. Calcium chelation with EDTA therapy (choice B) is not typically used to treat corneal tumors, and penetrating keratoplasty (choice C) may not be necessary at this stage, as the patient's visual acuity is still relatively good.

Therefore, the best option is to discuss superficial keratectomy to confirm the diagnosis by histopathologic examination. This approach will allow for a definitive diagnosis and guide further management, which may include additional surgery or other treatments if necessary.

**Answer**:C. Erosive pustular dermatosis

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with erosive pustular dermatosis (EPD), a chronic, inflammatory skin condition characterized by crusted, painful, and pruritic lesions on the scalp. The presence of actinic damage and a history of actinic keratoses treated with liquid nitrogen suggest that the patient has a predisposition to skin cancer, which increases the likelihood of EPD. The fact that the patient had a grade 1 acneiform eruption while on cancer therapy, which was managed with doxycycline hyclate and topical hydrocortisone and clindamycin phosphate, supports the diagnosis of EPD.

Folliculitis decalvans (choice A) is an uncommon condition characterized by inflammation and destruction of the hair follicles, leading to scarring alopecia. While the patient's scalp eruption and hair loss may resemble folliculitis decalvans, the presence of crusted lesions and purulent drainage suggests EPD is a more likely diagnosis.

Squamous cell carcinoma (choice B) is a type of skin cancer that can arise in sun-damaged skin, such as the scalp. However, the patient's history of actinic keratoses and the absence of any suspicious skin lesions suggest that squamous cell carcinoma is less likely.

Pemphigus foliaceus (choice D) is an autoimmune bullous disease that can cause crusted lesions on the scalp. However, the patient's history of cancer and actinic damage, as well as the presence of purulent drainage, argue against this diagnosis.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, as well as the patient's history of cancer and actinic damage, the most likely diagnosis is EPD.

**Answer**: D. Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome

The correct answer is D. Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome. This is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of the reproductive system, olfactory system, and other structures. The patient's symptoms of olfactory disorder, absence of menstruation, and vaginal defects are all consistent with MRKH syndrome. The presence of uterine rudiments and normal ovaries also support this diagnosis.

In contrast, the other answer choices do not fit the patient's symptoms as well:

A. Meningitis: This is an infection of the meninges, which is not related to the patient's symptoms.

B. VACTERL constellation: This is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of multiple organ systems, including the vertebrae, anal canal, cardiovascular system, trachea, esophagus, renal system, and limbs. While the patient does have some of these features, such as a laryngeal tracheoesophageal fissure and hearing loss, the absence of other features such as vertebral defects and anal atresia makes VACTERL constellation an unlikely diagnosis.

C. Kallmann syndrome: This is a genetic disorder that affects the development of the reproductive system and olfactory system. However, Kallmann syndrome typically presents with hypogonadism and infertility in males, and the patient's symptoms of olfactory disorder and absence of menstruation are not typical of Kallmann syndrome.

Therefore, D. Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome is the most likely diagnosis for the patient's symptoms.

**Answer**: B. Eosinophilic annular erythema

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, as well as the histopathological results of the skin biopsy, are consistent with the diagnosis of eosinophilic annular erythema (EAE). EAE is a rare, benign, and self-limiting cutaneous condition characterized by the development of erythematous, annular, or arciform plaques with a central clearing and mild scaling. The condition is often associated with underlying autoimmune or inflammatory disorders, such as atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, or lupus erythematosus. In this case, the patient's history of recurrent primary peritoneal carcinoma and recent initiation of immunotherapy with pembrolizumab and ipilimumab suggest an underlying immune-mediated process.

The patient's skin biopsy showed superficial and deep perivascular and interstitial inflammation, as well as numerous scattered eosinophils, which are hallmarks of EAE. The absence of scale and the presence of a central clearing in the plaques also support this diagnosis.

In contrast, erythema annulare centrifugum (EAC) is a condition characterized by the development of erythematous, annular plaques with a central clearing and mild scaling. EAC is often associated with underlying autoimmune or inflammatory disorders, such as lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, or thyroiditis. While the patient's history of recurrent primary peritoneal carcinoma and recent initiation of immunotherapy may suggest an underlying autoimmune process, the absence of any other systemic symptoms or signs of autoimmune disease, as well as the patient's age, make EAC less likely.

Granuloma annulare (GA) is a benign, chronic skin condition characterized by the development of small, flesh-colored or erythematous papules or nodules with a central crust or scale. GA is often associated with underlying autoimmune or inflammatory disorders, such as lup

**Answer**: A. Mantle cell lymphoma

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results, as well as the histopathological findings from the punch biopsy, are consistent with a diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma.

Mantle cell lymphoma is a type of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that typically affects older adults. The patient's age and symptoms of shortness of breath, along with the physical examination findings of leonine facies and madarosis, are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's laboratory results show marked leukocytosis with a high percentage of lymphocytes, which is also consistent with mantle cell lymphoma.

The histopathological findings from the punch biopsy show a dense diffuse dermal lymphoid infiltrate composed of small to medium cells with irregular nuclear contours. This is consistent with the infiltrative growth pattern of mantle cell lymphoma. Additionally, the immunohistochemistry results show diffusely positive cyclin D1 staining, which is a common feature of mantle cell lymphoma.

In contrast, folliculotropic mycosis fungoides (choice B) typically presents with papules, nodules, or plaques on the skin, and the histopathological findings show a folliculotropic pattern with a mixture of malignant T cells and benign follicular cells. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (choice C) typically presents with fever, night sweats, and weight loss, and the histopathological findings show a diffuse infiltrate of large cells with a high proliferation rate. Marginal zone lymphoma (choice D) typically presents with lymphadenopathy and bone marrow infiltration, and the histopathological findings show a marginal zone pattern with small lymphocytes surrounding larger cells.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and histopathological findings, the most likely diagnosis is mantle cell lymphoma.

**Answer**:B. Place a temporary pacemaker and start corticosteroids.

Explanation:
The patient presents with a viral prodrome, palpitations, dizziness, and heart block, which suggests a possible autoimmune response. The electrocardiogram shows a sinus rhythm with complete heart block (CHB) and a narrow QRS junctional escape at 65 beats per minute. The patient's history of fever, myalgias, sore throat, and cough, along with the elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, support the diagnosis of an autoimmune disorder.

Option B, placing a temporary pacemaker and starting corticosteroids, is the appropriate next step in management. The temporary pacemaker will help regulate the patient's heart rhythm and prevent bradycardia-related complications, while corticosteroids will help reduce inflammation and modulate the immune response.

Option A, placing a dual-chamber implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), is not the appropriate next step. Although an ICD may be necessary in the long term, it is not urgently needed at this point. The patient's current rhythm is a junctional escape rhythm, and there is no evidence of a life-threatening arrhythmia.

Option C, implanting a dual-chamber permanent pacemaker, is also not the appropriate next step. Permanent pacemakers are typically reserved for patients with persistent bradycardia or heart block that is unlikely to resolve. In this case, the patient's heart block is thought to be related to an autoimmune disorder, and it is possible that it may resolve with treatment.

Option D, starting ceftriaxone, is not the appropriate next step. Ceftriaxone is an antibiotic, and there is no evidence of a bacterial infection in this case. While it is possible that the patient may have a concurrent bacterial infection, it is not appropriate to start antibiotics without further evidence.

In summary, the most appropriate next step in management is to place a temporary pacemaker and start

**Answer**: C. Rett syndrome

Rett syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the brain and is characterized by a range of symptoms including microcephaly, intellectual disability, delayed development, loss of motor skills, and seizures. The patient's presentation of microcephaly, short stature, intellectual disability, and severe scoliosis, as well as the absence of autistic behavior, vision or hearing impairments, or epilepsy, are all consistent with Rett syndrome. Additionally, the MRI findings of a diffuse reduction in the corpus callosum involving splenium and enlarged right ventricle, resulting in cerebral lateral ventricular asymmetry, are also consistent with Rett syndrome.

Turner syndrome, which is characterized by short stature, microcephaly, and intellectual disability, was considered as option A. However, Turner syndrome typically presents with a distinctive facial appearance, including a broad forehead, a short neck, and a small jaw, which was not mentioned in the patient's description. Additionally, Turner syndrome is typically associated with a 45,X karyotype, which was not mentioned in the patient's blood reports.

Fragile X syndrome, which is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability, was considered as option B. However, Fragile X syndrome typically presents with a distinctive facial appearance, including a long face, a prominent forehead, and a prominent jaw, which was not mentioned in the patient's description. Additionally, Fragile X syndrome is typically associated with macroorchidism, which was not mentioned in the patient's description.

Cerebral palsy, which is a group of permanent disorders that appear in early childhood, was considered as option D. However, cerebral palsy typically presents with motor impairment, such as spasticity, ataxia, or athetosis, which was not mentioned in the patient's description.

**Answer**:A. Check levels of protein, albumin, prealbumin, and other nutritional laboratory measures

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of widespread edema, acute dermatitis, and growth faltering suggest a possible nutritional deficiency. The presence of hypopigmented patches on the skin, particularly on the scalp, raises the suspicion of a possible vitiligo. Checking the levels of serum protein, albumin, prealbumin, and other nutritional laboratory measures can help identify if there is a deficiency in protein, vitamins, or minerals that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms.

Choice B, checking urinalysis and urine microscopy to evaluate for protein in urine, may also be relevant in evaluating the patient's nutritional status, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case.

Choice C, performing a skin biopsy, may be necessary later on to confirm the diagnosis of vitiligo, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this point.

The correct answer is D. Pursue surgical evaluation.

The patient's symptoms of dizziness, chest pain, rash, and nail changes, along with the physical examination findings of petechiae, splinter hemorrhages, and petechial macules, suggest a possible diagnosis of endocarditis, which is an infection of the inner lining of the heart. The elevated troponin level and T-wave inversions on the electrocardiogram also support this diagnosis.

Given the patient's symptoms and examination findings, it is important to pursue surgical evaluation to confirm the diagnosis of endocarditis and to assess the extent of the infection. This may involve a thoracotomy or other surgical procedure to visualize the heart and its valves.

The other answer choices are not appropriate for the following reasons:

A. Perform a skin biopsy: While a skin biopsy may be useful in diagnosing certain skin conditions, it is not necessary in this case, as the patient's skin findings are consistent with endocarditis. Additionally, a skin biopsy would not provide information about the patient's cardiac status.

B. Administer tissue plasminogen activator: Tissue plasminogen activator is a medication used to dissolve blood clots. While it may be considered in the treatment of endocarditis, it is not the most appropriate next step in the patient's management. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a more urgent need for surgical evaluation to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of the infection.

C. Start empirical intravenous antibiotics: While antibiotics may be used to treat endocarditis, they should not be started empirically without first confirming the diagnosis. Intravenous antibiotics should be administered only after the diagnosis has been confirmed and the appropriate antibiotic regimen has been selected based on the results of blood cultures and other diagnostic tests.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in the patient's management is to pursue surgical evaluation to confirm the diagnosis of endocarditis and to assess the extent

**Answer**:C. Examine the abdomen during the EUA

The question asks for the next step in the management of a 14-month-old girl with recurrent subconjunctival hemorrhage and an orbital mass. The clinical examination and imaging studies have already been performed, and the results suggest an intraocular lesion and an orbital mass.

Option A, aspirating the orbital lesion, is not the next step. Aspiration is a procedure that is typically used to drain fluid or remove tissue for diagnostic purposes. In this case, the lesion is already known to be present, and aspiration would not provide any additional information.

Option B, scheduling an orbital computed tomography (CT) scan, is also not the next step. While a CT scan may be useful in evaluating the extent of the orbital mass, it would not provide information about the nature of the intraocular lesion. Additionally, CT scans are not typically performed under anesthesia, and the child would need to be sedated again for the procedure.

Option D, referring the child for a biopsy of the lesion, is not the next step. While a biopsy may ultimately be necessary to diagnose the lesion, it would not be appropriate at this point in the management of the child's condition. The child has already undergone multiple examinations and imaging studies, and the results suggest that there is an intraocular lesion and an orbital mass. A biopsy would not provide any additional information that would change the management of the child's condition.

Option C, examining the abdomen during the EUA, is the correct next step. The child's symptoms and examination findings suggest that there may be an underlying systemic condition that is causing the recurrent subconjunctival hemorrhage and orbital mass. Examining the abdomen during the EUA would help to identify any potential abdominal causes of the child's symptoms, such as a bleeding disorder or an abdominal tumor. This information would be important in guiding further management and treatment of the child's condition.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is D: Perform an anterior orbitotomy with abscess drainage in conjunction with endoscopic sinus surgery.

An anterior orbitotomy is a surgical procedure that involves making an incision in the eyelid to drain an abscess in the orbit. In this case, the patient has a 2.2-cm fluctuant mass in the right upper eyelid, which is tender to palpation, indicating the presence of an abscess. The abscess is also causing mass effect on the right globe, leading to hypoglobus, which is a condition where the eyeball is pushed forward and downward due to the presence of a mass in the orbit.

In addition to the abscess, the patient also has a right supraorbital abscess with mass effect on the right globe, leading to hypoglobus, and multiple communicating channels through inner and outer tables with cortical breakthrough in the frontal sinus. This indicates that the abscess has spread to the frontal sinus, which is a potentially life-threatening condition.

Therefore, the appropriate course of action would be to perform an anterior orbitotomy with abscess drainage in conjunction with endoscopic sinus surgery. This would allow the surgeon to drain the abscess in the orbit and remove any infected tissue, while also addressing the spread of the abscess to the frontal sinus through the communicating channels.

Now, let's discuss why the other choices are incorrect:

A: Perform an excisional biopsy. An excisional biopsy would involve removing a portion of the affected tissue for further examination. However, in this case, the patient has a clear diagnosis of an abscess, and there is no need for a biopsy. Moreover, performing a biopsy would not address the spread of the abscess to the frontal sinus.

B: Administer intravenous antibiotics and observe. While antibiotics may be appropriate for treating the infection, they would not address the abscess or the spread of the infection to the frontal sinus. Observation alone would not be sufficient, as the patient's condition has already wors

**Answer**:C. Refer the patient for urgent neuroimaging

Explanation:

The patient's symptoms of intermittent visual blurring, mild eyelid swelling, and conjunctival chemosis, along with the recent onset of a left-sided nonspecific dull headache and an annoying "whooshing" noise in the patient's left ear, suggest a possible underlying neurological condition. The persistent red eye and unresponsiveness to topical treatment also indicate a more severe condition than viral conjunctivitis.

Referring the patient for urgent neuroimaging (choice C) is the most appropriate next step, as it can help to identify any potential neurological causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a cerebral vasculature disorder, a tumor, or an aneurysm. This is a potentially sight-threatening condition, and timely diagnosis and treatment are crucial.

The other choices do not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and may not provide adequate treatment:

* Choice A, suggesting supportive strategies and considering increasing topical corticosteroid treatment or prescribing a topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), may provide some symptomatic relief but does not address the potential neurological cause.
* Choice B, prescribing an oral NSAID and/or systemic immunosuppression (oral corticosteroid) and performing chest radiography, urinalysis, blood tests, and other studies, may be appropriate for certain systemic conditions, but it does not address the patient's neurological symptoms.
* Choice D, performing a general examination (for a port-wine stain) and dilated ophthalmoscopy, may identify other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, but it does not address the urgent need for neuroimaging.

Therefore, referring the patient for urgent neuroimaging (choice C) is the most appropriate next step in the patient's management.

**Answer**:B. Obtain computed tomographic scan of the orbits

Explanation:
The correct answer is B, Obtain computed tomographic scan of the orbits, because it is the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic workup of this patient's condition.

A. Observe: This option is not appropriate because the patient has a clear abnormality on physical examination (proptosis and eyelid edema) and imaging study (intraconal mass on MRI). It is important to further evaluate the mass to determine its nature and potential impact on the patient's vision and overall health.

C. Perform a biopsy: While a biopsy may ultimately be necessary to diagnose the intraconal mass, it is not the most appropriate next step. Biopsy carries risks, including infection, bleeding, and tissue damage. Before performing a biopsy, it is important to gather as much information as possible about the mass to ensure that the procedure is necessary and to minimize potential complications.

D. Begin treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy: This option is not appropriate because there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has a malignancy that would require chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with a benign intraconal mass, and it is important to further evaluate the mass before initiating treatment.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to obtain a computed tomographic scan of the orbits to further evaluate the intraconal mass and determine its nature and potential impact on the patient's vision and overall health.

**Answer**: A. Ectopic parathyroid lipoadenoma

The correct answer is A, Ectopic parathyroid lipoadenoma, for the following reasons:

A. Ectopic parathyroid lipoadenoma:

This option is correct because the patient's symptoms, such as joint and musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, and hyperparathyroidism, are consistent with an ectopic parathyroid adenoma. Additionally, the imaging findings of a well-circumscribed fat density mass in the right retropharyngeal space posterior to the hypopharynx, which was not visible on the initial CT scan, support this diagnosis. Ectopic parathyroid lipoadenoma is a rare condition in which a parathyroid adenoma develops outside the thyroid gland, often in the neck or mediastinum.

B. Liposarcoma:

This option is incorrect because liposarcoma is a type of soft tissue sarcoma that typically affects the extremities, and is not commonly found in the retropharyngeal space. Additionally, the imaging findings do not support this diagnosis, as the mass appears to be well-circumscribed and has a fat density, which is not consistent with the infiltrative nature of liposarcoma.

C. Ectopic thyroid:

This option is incorrect because ectopic thyroid refers to a condition in which thyroid tissue is present outside the normal thyroid gland, often in the neck or mediastinum. While this condition can cause hyperthyroidism, it is not typically associated with hyperparathyroidism or the imaging findings described in the case.

D. Retropharyngeal abscess:

This option is incorrect because a retropharyngeal abscess is a collection of pus in the retropharyngeal space, typically caused by an infection. The imaging findings do not support this diagnosis, as the mass appears to be well-circumscribed and has a fat density, which is not consistent with an abscess.

The correct answer is D: Adenomatoid odontogenic tumor.

An adenomatoid odontogenic tumor (AOT) is a rare benign tumor that originates from the odontogenic epithelium and is usually associated with an impacted tooth. The patient's history of an 8-year history of right maxillary first premolar impaction and the finding of an impacted premolar at the superior margin of the growth on the CT scan are both consistent with AOT.

The histopathological features described in the question, such as a thickly encapsulated proliferation of odontogenic epithelial cells with pseudoglandular elements, are also consistent with AOT. The presence of ductlike structures, as seen in the high-powered view of the histopathology image (Figure, C), is a characteristic feature of AOT.

Now, let's discuss why the other answer choices are incorrect:

A: Dentigerous cyst
A dentigerous cyst is a type of odontogenic cyst that forms around the crown of an impacted tooth. While the patient's history of an impacted premolar may suggest a dentigerous cyst, the presence of a soft, fluctuant intraoral swelling and the absence of any drainage argue against this diagnosis. Additionally, the histopathology features described in the question do not support a diagnosis of dentigerous cyst.

B: Odontogenic keratocyst (keratocystic odontogenic tumor)
Odontogenic keratocyst (OKC) is a type of odontogenic tumor that is characterized by a keratinizing epithelial lining and a friable, paraffin-like cut surface. While OKC can be associated with impacted teeth, the histopathology features described in the question do not support a diagnosis of OKC. The presence of pseudoglandular elements and ductlike structures is not typical of OKC.

**Answer**:C. Palmar fasciitis and polyarthritis syndrome

The correct answer is C. Palmar fasciitis and polyarthritis syndrome because it aligns with the patient's symptoms and test results described in the case.

Palmar fasciitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the fascia, a band of tissue that runs along the palmar surface of the hand. It can cause pain, swelling, and redness in the palmar area, which are all symptoms that the patient in the case presented with. Additionally, the patient had multiple tender nodules that developed over the palms, which is consistent with the nodular formation that can occur in palmar fasciitis.

Polyarthritis syndrome, on the other hand, refers to inflammation in multiple joints. The patient in the case had multiple finger joint pain, which is a symptom of polyarthritis syndrome. The absence of nailfold capillary changes and distal digital pitting, which are typically seen in scleroderma, also supports this diagnosis.

The other answer choices do not align as well with the patient's symptoms and test results:

A. Dupuytren contracture is a condition that causes thickening and contracture of the tissue in the palmar surface of the hand, leading to flexion contractures. While the patient in the case did have flexion contractures, the presence of multiple tender nodules and the absence of characteristic nodules or cords in the palmar tissue do not support this diagnosis.

B. Fibroblastic rheumatism is a rare condition characterized by the proliferation of fibroblasts, leading to the formation of nodules and thickening of the skin. While the patient's skin biopsy showed increased fibroblasts with fibrosis, the absence of characteristic nodules or cords in the palmar tissue and the presence of polyarthritis do not support this diagnosis.

D. Scleroderma is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by hardening and thickening of the skin, as well as inflammation in multiple organs. While the patient's symptoms of rapidly progressive redness and stiffness of both hands and the absence of nailfold capill

**Answer**:A. Benign lymphangioendothelioma

The correct answer is A, Benign lymphangioendothelioma, for the following reasons:

A. Benign lymphangioendothelioma:
This diagnosis is correct because the clinical image and description of the patient's symptoms match the characteristics of benign lymphangioendothelioma. The reddish-brown color, the annular shape, and the peripheral ecchymosis are all consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of a gradually enlarging lesion over a period of 5 years, without any systemic symptoms, supports this diagnosis. The positive immunohistochemical staining for CD31, CD34, and D2-40, and the negative staining for HHV-8 and WT1, also support this diagnosis.

B. Kaposi sarcoma:
Kaposi sarcoma is a malignant vascular tumor that typically affects the skin and lymph nodes. While it can present with a similar appearance to benign lymphangioendothelioma, it is generally more aggressive and has a higher risk of metastasis. The patient's lack of systemic symptoms and the absence of local lymphadenopathy make Kaposi sarcoma less likely.

C. Hobnail hemangioma:
Hobnail hemangioma is a rare benign vascular tumor that typically presents as a small, red, pedunculated lesion. It is characterized by a distinctive "hobnail" appearance due to the presence of numerous small, rounded vessels. While it can occur in the axilla, the larger size and annular shape of the patient's lesion, as well as the absence of a peduncle, make hobnail hemangioma less likely.

D. Low-grade angiosarcoma:
Low-grade angiosarcoma is a malignant vascular tumor that can present with a similar appearance to benign lymphangioendothelioma. However, it typically has a more aggressive course and a higher risk of metastasis. The patient

**Answer**:C. Trial medical management with metoprolol and enoxaparin

The patient in question has a history of mitral valve endocarditis, which led to mitral valve repair without annuloplasty 15 years ago. She developed severe symptomatic mitral regurgitation during her last pregnancy, which was successfully treated with a cesarean delivery. Postpartum, her symptoms resolved, but she had persistent marked mitral regurgitation related to a severely deformed posterior leaflet. She underwent a complex redo MV repair (annuloplasty) 2 years ago and developed perioperative atrial fibrillation but declined anticoagulation and has not had further arrhythmias.

Given the patient's history and current symptoms, the best course of action would be to trial medical management with metoprolol and enoxaparin. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker that can help reduce the heart rate and alleviate symptoms of exertional dyspnea. Enoxaparin is a low-molecular-weight heparin that can help prevent thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation.

The other options are not the best choices for several reasons:

A. Perform balloon mitral valvuloplasty: This option may not be effective in reducing the mitral valve gradient in this patient, given the severity of the regurgitation and the deformed posterior leaflet. Moreover, the patient has already undergone a complex redo MV repair, which may have increased the risk of complications associated with another interventional procedure.

B. Perform transcatheter MV-in-ring procedure: This option may not be suitable for this patient, as the mitral valve annulus is already severely deformed, which may make it difficult to implant a transcatheter valve effectively. Moreover, the patient has a history of recurrent endocarditis, which may increase the risk of valve infection with a transcatheter valve.

D. Perform surgical MV replacement: This option may be considered as a last resort, given the patient's history of multiple surgeries and the potential risks associated with another surgical intervention

**Answer**:B. Rosai-Dorfman disease

The patient's symptoms and test results indicate Rosai-Dorfman disease, a rare condition that causes the body to produce excessive lymph tissue in the neck and other parts of the body. The patient's painless neck swelling, fever, sore throat, and laboratory test results, such as leukocytosis with neutrophilia, anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and elevated C-reactive protein level, are all consistent with this diagnosis. The ultrasonography and MRI results also support this diagnosis, as they show enlarged hyperemic lymph nodes in the neck and a destructive mass involving the left maxillary malar eminence. Additionally, the FDG PET/CT results demonstrate extensive FDG-avid right-sided cervical lymphadenopathy and innumerable FDG-avid lytic foci involving the axial and appendicular skeleton, which is consistent with Rosai-Dorfman disease.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (choice A) is a rare disorder that causes the body to produce too many Langerhans cells, which are a type of immune system cell. While it can cause lymphadenopathy and other symptoms similar to Rosai-Dorfman disease, it typically affects children younger than 10 years old and has a different clinical and radiological presentation.

Neuroblastoma (choice C) is a type of cancer that develops in the nerve tissue of the adrenal gland, neck, chest, or spine. While it can cause neck swelling and other symptoms, it typically affects children under the age of 5 and has a different clinical and radiological presentation.

Lymphoma (choice D) is a type of cancer that affects the immune system and can cause lymphadenopathy and other symptoms. However, the patient's age and clinical presentation are not consistent with lymphoma.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and test results, the most likely diagnosis is Rosai-Dorfman disease.

**Answer**: D. Perform a CT-guided biopsy for histological confirmation of recurrence or identification of other benign disease, such as granulomatous inflammation

The patient's symptoms of progressive dry cough, new consolidation lesion on chest radiography, and negative results for mycobacterial and bacteriologic surveys suggest that the patient may have developed interstitial lung disease (ILD) related to crizotinib therapy. The patient's history of smoking and lung cancer also increase the likelihood of ILD.

Option A, treating the patient with chemotherapy for disease recurrence, is not the best choice because there is no evidence of disease recurrence, and the patient's symptoms and radiographic findings are consistent with ILD.

Option B, administering antibiotics with coverage for pneumonia pathogen for 7 to 10 days and a repeated CT scan in 4 weeks, may be appropriate if the patient had a bacterial infection, but there is no evidence of infection in the patient's history, physical examination, or laboratory results.

Option C, administering steroid treatment and discontinuing crizotinib and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) permanently because TKI-induced interstitial lung disease is highly suspected, may be appropriate if the patient's symptoms and radiographic findings were definitively attributed to ILD. However, the patient's history of smoking and lung cancer increase the possibility of other lung pathologies, making it essential to perform a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.

Therefore, option D, performing a CT-guided biopsy for histological confirmation of recurrence or identification of other benign disease, such as granulomatous inflammation, is the best choice. The biopsy will help establish a definitive diagnosis, guide further management, and ensure that the patient receives appropriate treatment.

**Answer**:C. Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor

The correct answer is C. Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor because it is a rare and aggressive type of cancer that can occur in various parts of the body, including the orbit and parotid gland. The clinical presentation of a rapidly growing mass in the right eye and parotid gland, along with the imaging findings of a large subretinal lesion and a well-circumscribed mass in the parotid gland, are consistent with this diagnosis. The loss of INI-1, a tumor suppressor gene, in the pathological specimen from the parotid gland also supports this diagnosis.

Retinoblastoma (A) is a malignant tumor that develops in the retina and can present with similar clinical features, such as a unilateral mass in the eye. However, it typically affects children under the age of 5, and the presence of a parotid mass and the absence of a family history of retinoblastoma make it less likely in this case.

Rhabdomyosarcoma (B) is a malignant tumor that can occur in various soft tissues, including the orbit and parotid gland. However, it typically presents with a rapidly growing mass in the neck or orbit, and the presence of a subretinal lesion is less common.

Medulloepithelioma (D) is a rare type of pediatric cancer that can occur in the brain and spinal cord. It is not commonly associated with orbital or parotid masses, and the presence of a subretinal lesion and the absence of CSF findings make it less likely in this case.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and pathological features, the most likely diagnosis is C. Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is B: Improve glycemic control due to urinary magnesium loss from polyuria.

The patient's history of type 2 diabetes, atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, and hypertension suggests that they have a high risk of developing hypomagnesemia. The patient's recent serum magnesium levels (1.4 mg/dL to 1.6 mg/dL) are consistently low, indicating chronic hypomagnesemia. The patient's urinary magnesium loss, as indicated by the 24-hour urine magnesium level (not provided in the question), is likely due to polyuria, a common complication of diabetes.

Improving glycemic control can help reduce urinary magnesium loss and improve hypomagnesemia. Poor glycemic control can lead to increased glucose levels in the blood, which can increase the amount of glucose that is excreted in the urine. This can lead to increased urinary magnesium loss, as magnesium is reabsorbed in the renal tubules in exchange for glucose. By improving glycemic control, the patient's urinary magnesium loss can be reduced, which can help improve their hypomagnesemia.

The other answer choices are not correct for the following reasons:

A: Evaluate for alcoholism as the cause of hypomagnesemia.
Alcoholism can cause hypomagnesemia due to increased urinary magnesium loss and poor dietary intake. However, there is no indication in the patient's history or physical examination to suggest alcoholism. The patient's history of type 2 diabetes, atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, and hypertension suggests that their hypomagnesemia is more likely due to polyuria and poor glycemic control.

Answer: B. Metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma

Explanation:

* A. Tracheal granuloma: A tracheal granuloma is a type of inflammatory lesion that can occur in the trachea, typically in response to an inhaled foreign body or infection. While it is possible for a granuloma to occur in the subglottic region, the patient's history of rectal adenocarcinoma and lung metastases makes metastatic disease a more likely diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest a granuloma.
* C. Subglottic squamous cell carcinoma: Subglottic squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that arises in the squamous cells lining the subglottic region. While this diagnosis cannot be entirely excluded based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the patient's history of rectal adenocarcinoma and lung metastases makes metastatic disease a more likely diagnosis.
* D. Subglottic papilloma: Subglottic papilloma is a rare benign tumor that arises in the subglottic region. While this diagnosis cannot be entirely excluded based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the patient's history of rectal adenocarcinoma and lung metastases makes metastatic disease a more likely diagnosis.

In contrast, metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma is a likely diagnosis given the patient's history of rectal adenocarcinoma and lung metastases. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, including the presence of a new, 1-cm posterior subglottic lesion of unclear origin, are consistent with metastatic disease. The patient's partial response to previous treatment and maintenance of a confirmed partial response without evidence of progression of lung disease also support this diagnosis. The patient's age and history of smoking also increase the likelihood of a metastatic lesion.

Therefore, based on the patient's history, symptoms, physical examination findings, and imaging studies, metastatic rectal aden

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is D. Send blood test for drug levels.

The patient's history of heroin use and recent syncope suggests that drug-related causes should be considered. Although the patient denied recent drug use, it is still possible that drug use may have contributed to the syncopal episode. A blood test for drug levels can help determine if there are any drugs in the patient's system that may have caused the syncope.

Among the other options:

A. Starting amiodarone infusion therapy is not appropriate at this time. Amiodarone is an anti-arrhythmic drug used to treat certain types of arrhythmias, but it is not indicated for the evaluation of inherited arrhythmias. Additionally, the patient's syncopal episode may not be related to an arrhythmia.

B. Implanting an internal implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is also not appropriate at this time. An ICD is a device that is implanted in the body to regulate abnormal heart rhythms, but it is not typically used for the evaluation of inherited arrhythmias. Furthermore, the patient's syncopal episode may not be related to an arrhythmia.

C. Performing treadmill stress testing for evaluation of inherited arrhythmias may be a reasonable option, but it is not the most appropriate choice at this time. While stress testing can help identify certain arrhythmias, it may not be able to diagnose all types of inherited arrhythmias. Additionally, the patient's syncopal episode may not be related to an arrhythmia.

Therefore, the best option is D. Send blood test for drug levels to help determine if drug use may have contributed to the patient's syncope.

Sure! Here's my explanation:

**Answer**: C. Organophosphate poisoning

The patient's symptoms of generalized weakness, increased sweating, severe nausea, and vomiting, as well as the bilateral hyperdensity of the globus pallidi on the computed tomography (CT) scan, are consistent with organophosphate poisoning. Organophosphates are a class of insecticides that can cause neurotoxicity in humans. They work by inhibiting the enzyme acetylcholinesterase, leading to an accumulation of acetylcholine in the nervous system, which can cause a range of symptoms including muscle weakness, fasciculations, and confusion.

The patient's recent travel to Cuba and the absence of any other clear cause of her symptoms suggest that organophosphate poisoning is a likely diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's urine toxicology screen was negative for other substances that could cause similar symptoms, such as acetaminophen, salicylates, opiates, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, and ethanol, which supports the diagnosis of organophosphate poisoning.

The other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms:

A. Carbon monoxide poisoning: Carbon monoxide is a toxic gas that can cause headache, dizziness, nausea, and vomiting, but it does not typically cause muscle weakness or fasciculations. The patient's negative blood test for carbon monoxide and the absence of any other signs of carbon monoxide poisoning make it an unlikely diagnosis.

B. Methanol poisoning: Methanol is a toxic alcohol that can cause vomiting, abdominal pain, and visual disturbances, but it does not typically cause muscle weakness or fasciculations. The patient's negative urine toxicology screen for methanol and the absence of any other signs of methanol poisoning make it an unlikely diagnosis.

**Answer**:A. Order magnetic resonance imaging

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of bilateral visual field defects, headaches, and loss of vision in the right eye, along with the physical examination findings of afferent pupillary defect, diminished color vision, and abnormal automated 24-2 Humphrey visual field testing results, suggest the possibility of a neuro-ophthalmic disorder. The presence of small, tilted optic nerves with peripapillary atrophy on the optic disc photographs also supports this diagnosis.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the appropriate next step in the diagnostic workup of this patient. MRI can help to identify any structural abnormalities in the brain and orbit that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms, such as a tumor, cyst, or stroke. It can also help to evaluate the extent of any damage to the optic nerves and surrounding tissue.

The other options are not the most appropriate next steps in the diagnostic workup of this patient. Option B, perform trabeculectomy to optimize intraocular pressure control, may be necessary in the future if the patient's glaucoma is not well-controlled, but it is not directly related to the patient's current symptoms and examination findings. Option C, monitor closely with serial examinations and repeated visual field testing, may be appropriate for monitoring the progression of the patient's condition, but it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Option D, reassure the patient that her findings are consistent with longstanding changes caused by a congenital defect, is not supported by the patient's history of recent-onset symptoms and abnormal examination findings.

**Answer**: B. Cutaneous meningeal heterotopia

The correct answer is B. Cutaneous meningeal heterotopia because it best fits the clinical and dermoscopic features described in the case.

Cutaneous meningeal heterotopia is a rare congenital malformation characterized by the presence of meningeal tissue, which normally lines the central nervous system, in the skin. It typically presents as a solitary, asymptomatic nodule or plaque on the scalp, as seen in this case. The lesion is usually firm and adherent to the underlying bone, which is also consistent with the case presentation.

The clinical and dermoscopic features described in the case are not consistent with the other answer choices:

A. Chondroid syringoma: This is a benign tumor that originates from the sweat gland ducts. It typically presents as a small, painless nodule or plaque on the scalp, but it can also occur on other parts of the body. Chondroid syringoma is usually characterized by a lobulated or polypoid surface and a yellowish-white color. The dermoscopic features described in the case, such as the homogeneous yellow hue and absence of follicular ostia, are not consistent with chondroid syringoma.

C. Scalp metastasis: This occurs when cancer cells from another part of the body spread to the scalp. Scalp metastasis can present as a solitary nodule or plaque, but it is usually associated with other systemic symptoms, such as weight loss, fatigue, and pain. The patient in this case denied any systemic symptoms, and there was no evidence of cancer elsewhere in the body.

D. Proliferative nodule in a congenital melanocytic nevus: This is a type of skin lesion that is present at birth or appears shortly after birth.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is D. Observe periocular lesions while psychiatric treatment is continued.

The patient's history of bulimia and daily purging suggests that the vascular lesions may be related to her eating disorder. It's important to address the underlying psychiatric issue before proceeding with any surgical or medical interventions. Observing the periocular lesions while continuing psychiatric treatment allows for monitoring of any changes in the lesions and ensures that the patient receives appropriate care for her eating disorder, which may potentially resolve the issue.

Now, let's discuss why the other choices are incorrect:

A. Sclerotherapy: This choice is incorrect because sclerotherapy is a minimally invasive procedure that involves injecting a solution into the affected blood vessels to cause them to collapse and scar. It's primarily used to treat small, superficial hemangiomas and is not appropriate for larger, deeper lesions like those described in the patient's case.

B. Surgical excision: This choice is incorrect because surgical excision would involve removing the affected tissue, which could potentially cause cosmetic and functional issues for the patient. Additionally, it's unclear whether the lesions are benign or malignant, and surgical excision may not be necessary if the lesions are not cancerous.

C. Initiate systemic administration of propranolol: This choice is incorrect because propranolol is a medication commonly used to treat hypertension, angina, and certain heart rhythm disorders. While it may be used off-label to treat some vascular malformations, it's not the appropriate first-line treatment for the patient's condition. It's important to address the underlying psychiatric issue and monitor the lesions before considering medical interventions.

I hope this explanation helps clarify the correct answer and why the other choices are not appropriate.

D. Perform a complete posterior lamellar resection is the correct answer.

The patient presented with a persistent swelling of the left upper eyelid, which was diagnosed to be an epithelial tumor after an MRI scan. The tumor was located in the left upper eyelid and superficial lobe of the left parotid gland. A complete posterior lamellar resection would be the best option to remove the tumor entirely, as it allows for the removal of the entire tumor along with the involved tarsal plate, which is the thin plate of connective tissue that supports the eyelid. This surgical procedure would also help to address any potential cosmetic concerns by preserving the eyelid's natural appearance.

Administering topical interferon alfa-2b (choice A) would not be an appropriate treatment option as it is used to treat viral infections, and there is no indication of a viral infection in this case.

Starting external beam radiotherapy (choice B) would also not be the best option as it may not be effective in removing the tumor completely, and it may also cause damage to surrounding tissues.

Administering intralesional fluorouracil (choice C) may be effective in shrinking the tumor, but it would not remove the tumor entirely, and it may also have side effects such as inflammation, pain, and scarring.

Therefore, D. Perform a complete posterior lamellar resection is the best option to effectively remove the tumor while preserving the eyelid's natural appearance.

**Answer**: B. Eosinophilic dermatosis of hematologic malignancy

The correct answer is B, Eosinophilic dermatosis of hematologic malignancy, because it most closely matches the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

The patient presents with a 3-week history of a pruritic and generalized cutaneous eruption, which is consistent with eosinophilic dermatosis. The patient's age and recent diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) also support this diagnosis, as eosinophilic dermatosis is a known complication of hematologic malignancies, particularly AML.

The patient's laboratory results also support this diagnosis, as they show leukopenia and a slightly elevated C-reactive protein level, which are consistent with the systemic inflammation and bone marrow dysfunction that can occur in AML. The patient's erythematous eruption, composed of small indurated and edematous papules, and the presence of hyperpigmented patches and focal areas of bruiselike discoloration, are also consistent with eosinophilic dermatosis.

The histopathologic findings, which show a superficial and deep dermal perivascular and interstitial mononuclear infiltrate with numerous eosinophils, further support the diagnosis of eosinophilic dermatosis.

In contrast, the other answer choices do not match the patient's symptoms and laboratory results as closely.

A, Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, is an unlikely diagnosis because the patient has no history of new medication use, and the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a drug reaction.

**Answer**:C. Extract the lesion surgically

The patient's symptoms of headache, photophobia, vomiting, and confusion, along with the physical examination findings of somnolence and confusion without focal neurologic deficits, are consistent with hydrocephalus and cerebral edema. The laboratory analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained from the ventriculostomy and the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with and without contrast support the diagnosis of obstructive hydrocephalus due to a nonenhancing lesion obstructing the aqueduct of Sylvius.

The sudden decrease in intracranial pressure and cerebrospinal fluid drainage on hospital day 5, along with the resolution of hydrocephalus and the movement of the nonenhancing lesion from the aqueduct of Sylvius to the fourth ventricle, suggest that the lesion is likely a migrating parasite.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Extract the lesion surgically. Surgical removal of the parasitic lesion is necessary to treat the patient's obstructive hydrocephalus and prevent further complications.

In contrast, the other answer choices are not appropriate for the patient's condition:

A. Observe the patient without intervention: This choice does not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and could lead to further complications.

B. Initiate anthelminthic therapy with adjuvant steroids: While anthelminthic therapy may be effective in treating parasitic infections, it is not appropriate in this case as the parasite is causing an obstructive hydrocephalus that requires surgical intervention. Adjuvant steroids may also not be effective in treating the parasitic infection and may have adverse effects.

D. Divert cerebrospinal fluid via ventriculoperitoneal shunt: While a ventriculoperitoneal shunt may be effective in treating hydrocephalus, it is not appropriate in this case as the underlying cause of the hydrocephalus is a parasitic lesion that requires surgical removal.

**Answer**:C. Order a thoracic CT scan

The correct answer is C. Order a thoracic CT scan. The patient's symptoms of exertional dyspnea and lower extremity edema, along with the physical examination findings of diminished breath sounds at the lung bases and partial nonpitting edema of the lower extremities, suggest the possibility of pulmonary or cardiovascular disease. A thoracic CT scan would be helpful in evaluating the lung tissue and identifying any potential lesions or abnormalities that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms.

In contrast, option A, Perform microscopy of nail scrapings after keratolysis with potassium hydroxide solution, is not the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation. While the patient's nail changes may be suggestive of a fungal infection, the presence of yellow discoloration and thickening of the nails, as well as the patient's history of hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea, suggest that there may be other underlying conditions that need to be addressed first.

Option B, Order radiographs of hands and feet, may be useful in evaluating the patient's bone health and identifying any potential bone abnormalities, but it is not the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

Option D, Order measurement of serum ferritin level, serum iron level, and serum total iron-binding capacity, may be useful in evaluating the patient's iron status, but it is not the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. The patient's history of hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea, along with the presence of edema and diminished breath sounds, suggest that there may be underlying cardiovascular or pulmonary disease that needs to be evaluated first.

**Answer**:B. Capecitabine-induced terminal ileitis

The patient's symptoms of watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, and hypokalemia are consistent with capecitabine-induced gastrointestinal toxicity. Capecitabine is a chemotherapy drug known to cause diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting, especially when combined with other chemotherapeutic agents like oxaliplatin, as in this case. The patient's history of recently diagnosed metastatic appendiceal adenocarcinoma and treatment with capecitabine and oxaliplatin supports this diagnosis.

Option A, cytomegalovirus ileitis, is unlikely since the patient's infectious workup results were unremarkable, and there is no mention of viral cultures or PCR tests to support this diagnosis.

Option C, ileal metastasis, is also unlikely since the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are more consistent with a gastrointestinal side effect of chemotherapy rather than metastatic disease. Additionally, the patient's abdominal pain and hyperactive bowel sounds suggest a more functional or inflammatory process rather than a mechanical obstruction caused by metastasis.

Option D, small bowel carcinoid tumor, is unlikely since the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not support this diagnosis. Carcinoid tumors typically present with symptoms such as flushing, diarrhea, and abdominal pain, but the patient's symptoms are more consistent with capecitabine-induced gastrointestinal toxicity. Additionally, the patient's age and medical history do not suggest a carcinoid tumor.

**Answer**:D. Order brain magnetic resonance imaging

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of progressive vision loss, bilateral peripheral iridotomies, and asymmetrically enlarged cup-disc ratio with mild pallor of the left optic nerve, along with the findings of diffuse thinning of the left eye on OCT, suggest the possibility of a neuro-ophthalmic disorder. The patient's history of chronic angle-closure glaucoma increases the likelihood of a compressive optic neuropathy, which can cause diffuse thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer. However, the presence of a temporal scotoma on visual field testing and the absence of any other ocular abnormalities suggest that the cause of vision loss may not be solely due to glaucoma.

Therefore, the next step would be to order a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to rule out any intracranial causes of vision loss, such as a compressive lesion or stroke, which could be affecting the visual pathway and causing the patient's symptoms.

The other options are not the most appropriate next steps for the following reasons:

A. Refer to a retina specialist owing to retinal thinning: While retinal thinning is a significant finding, it is not the most pressing concern in this case. The patient's symptoms of progressive vision loss and the presence of a temporal scotoma suggest a potential neuro-ophthalmic disorder that requires further evaluation before a retina specialist is consulted.

B. Start intraocular pressure–lowering medications owing to GCL loss: While the patient's intraocular pressure is within normal limits, the presence of diffuse thinning of the retinal nerve fiber layer suggests that the patient may have a compressive optic neuropathy, which is not typically treated with intraocular pressure-lowering medications.

C. Order a carotid doppler: This test would not provide any information relevant to the patient's symptoms or findings. There is no evidence to suggest that the patient has a carotid artery disease or any other vascular condition that would cause their symptoms

**Answer**:D. Initiate admission, high-dose systemic steroids, and a rheumatology consult.

The patient's symptoms of severe, progressive pain, redness, and decreased visual acuity in the left eye, along with the physical examination findings of marked inferior redness, scleral thinning, epithelial defect, and retinal detachment, suggest a severe inflammatory process, possibly related to thyroid eye disease. The patient's history of hyperthyroidism and recent strabismus surgery also support this diagnosis.

Option A, giving fortified antibiotics, may be appropriate for a bacterial infection, but it is not the most appropriate choice for an inflammatory process.

Option B, giving topical steroids and cycloplegia, may help reduce inflammation and prevent further damage to the eye, but it does not address the underlying systemic inflammatory process.

Option C, providing systemic corticosteroids and outpatient follow-up, may be appropriate for some cases of thyroid eye disease, but in this case, the patient's severe symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a more urgent need for hospitalization and high-dose systemic steroids.

Therefore, the correct answer is option D, Initiate admission, high-dose systemic steroids, and a rheumatology consult. This will allow for close monitoring and treatment of the patient's inflammatory process, as well as evaluation by a rheumatologist to determine the underlying cause and appropriate further management.

**Answer**: C. Clear cell odontogenic carcinoma

The correct answer is C. Clear cell odontogenic carcinoma, as it best matches the clinical and histopathological features described in the case.

A. Odontogenic keratocyst is an odontogenic tumor that arises from the remnants of the dental lamina and is usually associated with an impacted tooth. However, it is not the correct diagnosis in this case because the lesion is not a cyst and does not have the characteristic histopathological features of an odontogenic keratocyst, such as a lining of stratified squamous epithelium and a keratinized layer.

B. Ameloblastoma is a benign odontogenic tumor that arises from the remnants of the enamel organ. It typically presents as a slow-growing, painless swelling in the jaw and has a characteristic "soap bubble" appearance on radiographs. However, it is not the correct diagnosis in this case because the lesion is not benign and does not have the characteristic histopathological features of ameloblastoma, such as a follicular or acinar pattern and the presence of Tomes' processes.

D. Salivary clear cell carcinoma is a malignant salivary gland tumor that arises from the clear cells of the salivary glands. It typically presents as a painless mass in the parotid or submandibular gland and has a characteristic "salt and pepper" appearance on histopathology. However, it is not the correct diagnosis in this case because the lesion is not a salivary gland tumor and does not have the characteristic histopathological features of salivary clear cell carcinoma, such as a clear cell component and a prominent nucleolus.

C. Clear cell odontogenic carcinoma is a rare malignant odontogenic tumor that arises from the remnants of the odontogenic epithelium. It typically presents as a rapidly growing, painful swelling in the jaw and has a characteristic "spiculated" or "stellate" appearance on radiographs. The histopathological features

**Answer**:C. Pigmented extramammary Paget disease

The correct answer is C. Pigmented extramammary Paget disease. This is because the clinical presentation of an enlarged and variegated plaque on the axilla, with well-demarcated margins, and the histopathological findings of an intraepidermal neoplasm consisting of pagetoid cells with round, pale, vacuolated cytoplasm and large pleomorphic nuclei, are consistent with pigmented extramammary Paget disease. The positive staining for EMA and the presence of numerous reactive dendritic HMB-45-positive melanocytes scattered among the tumor cells further support this diagnosis.

A. Pagetoid Bowen disease is an incorrect choice because, although it is a type of intraepidermal neoplasm, it typically presents as a small, well-defined, pink or flesh-colored papule or plaque, and does not have the characteristic pagetoid cells with round, pale, vacuolated cytoplasm and large pleomorphic nuclei seen in pigmented extramammary Paget disease.

B. Inverse lichen planus is an incorrect choice because it is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by scaly, crusted, or fissured plaques, often on the flexural surfaces of the body, and does not have the characteristic pagetoid cells with round, pale, vacuolated cytoplasm and large pleomorphic nuclei seen in pigmented extramammary Paget disease.

D. Superficial spreading melanoma is an incorrect choice because it is a type of skin cancer that typically presents as a pigmented lesion with irregular borders, and does not have the characteristic pagetoid cells with round, pale, vacuolated cytoplasm and large pleomorphic nuclei seen in pigmented extramammary Paget disease. Additionally, the absence of a breast mass or lymphadenopathy makes it less likely that the lesion is a melanoma.

The correct answer is B: Subcutaneous dirofilariasis.

**A: Onchocercoma**
Onchocercoma is a type of skin lesion caused by the parasite Onchocerca volvulus. While it is possible for Onchocerca volvulus to cause skin lesions, the characteristics of the lesion described in the case do not match the typical presentation of onchocercoma. Onchocercoma lesions are usually small, papular, and intensely itchy, and they are typically found in areas exposed to the sun. The lesion described in the case is larger, firm, and nontender, and it is located on the scalp, which is not a typical location for onchocercoma. Additionally, the histopathological features of the lesion, such as the presence of a fibrous capsule and the absence of an eosinophilic infiltrate, do not support the diagnosis of onchocercoma.

**C: Cutaneous loiasis**
Cutaneous loiasis is a skin infection caused by the parasite Loa loa. While Loa loa can cause skin lesions, the characteristics of the lesion described in the case do not match the typical presentation of cutaneous loiasis. Cutaneous loiasis lesions are usually small, papular, and intensely itchy, and they are typically found in areas exposed to the sun.

**Answer**: A. Relapsing polychondritis

Relapsing polychondritis is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the cartilage and can cause inflammation and damage to various cartilaginous structures in the body, including the ears, nose, and larynx. The symptoms described in the case, such as the recurrent sore throat, hoarseness of voice, swelling and redness of the left ear, and saddle-shaped deformity of the nose, are all consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's history of taking multiple courses of oral antibiotics without improvement, as well as the laboratory test results showing elevated inflammatory markers and anemia, also support this diagnosis.

In contrast, the other answer choices do not fit the patient's symptoms and laboratory results as well.

**B. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis**: This is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the blood vessels and can cause inflammation and damage to various organs, including the lungs, kidneys, and sinuses.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is C. Order hemoglobin electrophoresis.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with sickle cell retinopathy, a complication of sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder that affects the production of hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to the body's tissues. The disease is caused by mutations in the HBB gene, which codes for the beta-globin subunit of hemoglobin.

Hemoglobin electrophoresis is a laboratory test that measures the different types of hemoglobin in the blood. It is commonly used to diagnose and monitor sickle cell disease, as well as other hemoglobinopathies. By performing hemoglobin electrophoresis, the clinician can determine the patient's hemoglobin genotype and identify any abnormal hemoglobin variants that may be present.

In this case, the patient's lack of a known history of sickle cell disease or trait and any family history of sickle disease suggests that she may have an undiagnosed hemoglobinopathy. Therefore, ordering hemoglobin electrophoresis is the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation.

The other answer choices are not as appropriate for the following reasons:

A. Initiate intravitreal corticosteroids: While corticosteroids may be used to treat some complications of sickle cell disease, such as macular edema, they are not the first-line treatment for sickle cell retinopathy. Intravitreal corticosteroids may also have adverse effects, such as cataract formation and increased intraocular pressure, and their use in this case would be premature without first confirming the diagnosis of sickle cell disease.

B. Perform a skin biopsy to consider neovascularization from pseudoxanthoma elasticum: Pseudoxanthoma elasticum is a rare genetic disorder that affects the elastic tissue in the skin, eyes, and cardiovascular system. While it can cause neovascularization, it is not typically

**Answer**:B. Sarcoidosis

The correct answer is B. Sarcoidosis. The patient's symptoms of progressive dyspnea, snoring, dysphagia, and weight loss, along with the physical examination findings of diffuse upper airway lymphoid hyperplasia and supraglottic edema, are consistent with sarcoidosis. The patient's history of vaccinated boy with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and β-thalassemia trait and both parents had a history of latent tuberculosis infection treated after immigrating to the US from Syria shortly after the patient’s birth, also support this diagnosis.

The patient's normal angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level and negative titers for antinuclear antibody (ANA), cytoplasmic antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody, perinuclear antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody, antimyeloperoxidase antibody, antiproteinase 3 antibody, anti–double-stranded DNA antibody, Smith antibody, Sjogren antibodies, and histoplasma antibodies, and normal results on tuberculin purified protein derivative and interferon-γ release assay (QuantiFERON; Qiagen), make it less likely that the patient has tuberculosis or granulomatosis with polyangiitis.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are not consistent with epiglottitis, which is an inflammation of the epiglottis, usually caused by a viral or bacterial infection.

Tuberculosis is a possibility, but the patient's negative results on tuberculin purified protein derivative and interferon-γ release assay (QuantiFERON; Qiagen) and the absence of any other symptoms or signs of tuberculosis, make it less likely.

**Answer**:B. Plan an urgent examination under anesthesia, ultrasonography, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

The correct answer is B because it is crucial to perform a thorough evaluation under anesthesia to determine the nature and extent of the retinal mass and any potential associated intraocular or orbital abnormalities. This is necessary to ensure the best possible outcome for the patient's vision and eye health.

Option A, initiating a uveitis workup for infectious and inflammatory conditions, may be appropriate in some cases, but it is not the most urgent or appropriate step in this scenario. The patient's symptoms and examination findings do not suggest uveitis, and it is important to prioritize the evaluation and management of the retinal mass.

Option C, obtaining chest and abdomen MRI to evaluate for cardiac rhabdomyoma and kidney cysts or tumors associated with neurocutaneous syndromes, may also be appropriate in some cases, but it is not the most urgent step in this scenario. While it is important to consider the potential associated systemic abnormalities, the immediate priority should be to evaluate and manage the retinal mass to prevent any potential vision loss.

Option D, continuing to monitor clinically with serial examinations, may be appropriate in some cases, but it is not the most appropriate step in this scenario. Given the presence of a large, unilateral retinal mass, it is important to perform a thorough evaluation and take appropriate action to ensure the best possible outcome for the patient's vision and eye health.

**Answer**:B. Perform resection surgery as soon as possible

Explanation:

B. Perform resection surgery as soon as possible is the correct answer because it is the most appropriate step to take given the patient's symptoms and test results. The patient has been experiencing chronic abdominal distension and dyspepsia, which could be indicative of a gastrointestinal tumor. The transthoracic echocardiogram showed a mobile mass located on the tricuspid valve, which could be a metastasis. Resection surgery would allow for the removal of the mass and the determination of its nature, which would guide further treatment.

A. Perform positron emission tomography–computed tomography to rule out tumor metastasis is not the correct answer because while it may be useful in determining the extent of the disease, it would not provide a definitive diagnosis or guide treatment.

C. Perform blood cultures and provide antibiotic therapy is not the correct answer because there is no indication of infection or sepsis.

D. Provide anticoagulation therapy only is not the correct answer because while it may be necessary to prevent thromboembolic events, it would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

**Answer**:C. Repeat punch biopsy for hematoxylin-eosin staining and DIF

The patient in the scenario has a history of pruritic eruption that has been persistent for 5 months, despite treatment with oral corticosteroids. The patient's presentation, with tense bullae and indurated papules and plaques, and oral mucosal erosions, suggests a severe autoimmune bullous process. The patient's history of pembrolizumab use and recent discontinuation suggests a possible adverse effect of the medication.

Repeating the punch biopsy for hematoxylin-eosin staining and DIF (choice C) is the most appropriate next step in management. The patient's history of pembrolizumab use and recent discontinuation, along with the patient's presentation, suggests a possible immune-related adverse event. A repeat biopsy would allow for further evaluation of the skin lesions and may provide additional information to support this diagnosis. Additionally, DIF can help to rule out other autoimmune blistering diseases such as pemphigus or bullous pemphigoid.

Starting a different PD-1 inhibitor (choice A) may not be appropriate at this time, as the patient has already experienced a severe adverse event with pembrolizumab. It is important to first investigate the cause of the patient's current condition and ensure that the patient is not at risk for further harm before considering additional immunotherapy.

Providing intravenous fluids and wound care in a burn unit (choice B) may be necessary for the patient's current condition, but it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. It is important to first determine the cause of the patient's symptoms and develop a plan to manage the underlying condition before considering wound care or other supportive measures.

Discharging the patient with topical triamcinolone 0.5% cream (choice D) may not be appropriate at this time, as the patient's condition is severe and requires further evaluation and management. The patient's history of pembrolizumab use and recent discontinuation, along with the patient's

**Answer**:C. No stenosis or plaque. Because of high negative predictive value, no further testing is necessary.

The correct answer is C. No stenosis or plaque. Because of high negative predictive value, no further testing is necessary.

The patient underwent coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography, which showed no coronary stenosis. In this case, it is appropriate to rely on the negative predictive value of CT angiography, which is high for excluding coronary artery disease (CAD) in patients with a low to intermediate pretest probability of CAD, as in this case. Therefore, no further testing is necessary.

Option A, "No coronary stenosis. If symptoms persist, recommend a follow-up CT and perfusion imaging," is incorrect because it suggests repeating the test that has already been done, which may not provide additional information and may expose the patient to unnecessary radiation.

Option B, "No coronary stenosis. Because of the chest pain, recommend further functional testing," is incorrect because it suggests additional testing without considering the negative predictive value of the CT angiography. The patient's symptoms may be due to other causes, and further testing may not provide a definitive answer.

Option D, "Relevant coronary stenosis cannot be excluded by CT. Recommend invasive coronary angiography," is incorrect because it suggests an invasive procedure without considering the negative predictive value of the CT angiography. Invasive coronary angiography carries risks and should only be considered when the likelihood of CAD is high.

In summary, option C is the best answer because it takes into account the negative predictive value of CT angiography and avoids unnecessary further testing.

**Answer**:B. Cancer-associated PPP syndrome

The patient's symptoms, including widespread arthritis, skin nodules, and pancreatitis, are consistent with cancer-associated PPP syndrome. This syndrome is a rare paraneoplastic disorder that is associated with various types of cancer, including pancreatic cancer. The patient's high levels of lipase and amylase, as well as the bone CT findings of cortical bone destruction and intraosseous medullary necrosis, support the diagnosis of PPP syndrome. In contrast, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder that can cause arthritis and skin lesions, but it is not typically associated with pancreatitis or bone destruction. Dermatomyositis is a rare autoimmune disorder that can cause skin lesions and muscle weakness, but it is not typically associated with pancreatitis or bone destruction. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is a rare autoimmune disorder that can cause skin lesions and joint pain, but it is not typically associated with pancreatitis or bone destruction. Therefore, option B, cancer-associated PPP syndrome, is the most appropriate diagnosis for this patient.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of hemorrhagic optic disc edema, peripapillary and subfoveal subretinal fluid, tortuous and dilated retinal vasculature, intraretinal hemorrhages in all 4 quadrants, and far peripheral temporal inner retinal whitening in both eyes, along with the workup findings of elevated opening pressure, elevated cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count, severe anemia, lymphocytosis with predominantly atypical lymphocytes, and high IgM level, are consistent with the diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). The patient's symptoms and findings suggest a severe and urgent condition that requires prompt intervention.

Option C, advise urgent plasmapheresis in consultation with oncology, is the correct answer because plasmapheresis is a procedure that can help remove antibodies and other harmful proteins from the blood, which can help alleviate the symptoms of IIH. In consultation with oncology, the patient's severe anemia, lymphocytosis, and high IgM level suggest a possible underlying hematological malignancy, which would require urgent attention from a hematologist-oncologist.

Option A, inject intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor, is incorrect because while anti-VEGF injections can be used to treat some eye conditions, such as age-related macular degeneration, they are not appropriate for the treatment of IIH.

Option B, start empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics and antivirals, is also incorrect because there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has an infection or a viral illness. Moreover, antibiotics and antivirals would not address the underlying cause of IIH.

Option D, initiate a hypercoagulability workup, is incorrect because while a hypercoagulability workup may be appropriate for some patients with IIH, it is not the most urgent or appropriate step in this case given the patient's severe symptoms and

**Answer**:A. Juxtafacet cyst

The patient's symptoms of globus sensation, dysphagia, and localized throat swelling, along with the physical examination findings of a mucosally covered mass on the left lateral pharyngeal wall, are consistent with a juxtafacet cyst. The imaging findings of a pharyngeal cyst that extends to the atlantoaxial joint and communicates with it, as seen on both CT and MRI, further support this diagnosis.

A juxtafacet cyst is a type of synovial cyst that forms in the facet joints of the cervical spine. These cysts are typically located lateral to the vertebral body and can extend into the surrounding soft tissues, including the pharynx. They are usually asymptomatic but can cause symptoms such as dysphagia, odynophagia, and neck pain when they become inflamed or compress nearby structures.

The other answer choices are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.

B. Mucus retention cyst: This type of cyst is typically located in the maxillary sinus and is caused by the accumulation of mucus. It is not associated with the facet joints or the atlantoaxial joint.

C. Tornwaldt cyst: This type of cyst is a rare developmental anomaly that occurs in the nasopharynx. It is not associated with the facet joints or the atlantoaxial joint.

D. Spinal bronchogenic cyst: This type of cyst is a congenital anomaly that arises from the embryonic development of the trachea and bronchi. It is not associated with the facet joints or the atlantoaxial joint.

Therefore, the correct answer is A. Juxtafacet cyst.

**Answer**:A. Observe until repeated incident

Explanation:
The case presented is a 72-year-old woman who experienced episodes of nontraumatic transient vision loss for 2 weeks. The patient was evaluated by an ophthalmologist and had abnormal findings on slitlamp examination, including resolved hyphema and abnormal blood vessels at the superotemporal pupillary margin of the iris. The patient was prescribed medication to reduce inflammation and lower intraocular pressure (IOP). On further examination, the patient's visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/50 OS, and IOP was 15 mm Hg OD and 16 mm Hg OS. Slitlamp examination results in the right eye appeared normal, whereas the left eye demonstrated subtle, multifocal ectatic vascular channels arranged circumferentially at the pupillary margin. On fluorescein angiography (FA), both the right and left irises displayed multifocal, pinpoint areas of hyperfluorescence at the pupillary margin, which was more noticeable on the left iris.

Given the patient's history and examination findings, the most appropriate next step would be to observe the patient until there is a repeated incident. This is because the patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with a possible vasculature disorder, and further evaluation is needed to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate treatment.

Choice B, photocoagulate lesions with argon laser at slitlamp evaluation, is not the most appropriate next step. While photocoagulation may be a treatment option for certain ocular vasculature disorders, it is not appropriate in this case without further evaluation and diagnosis.

Choice C, administer intravitreal bevacizumab injections, is also not the most appropriate next step. Intravitreal injections of bevacizumab are typically used to treat neovascular age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and retinal vein occlusion, but are not typically used to treat ocular vasculature disorders.

**Answer**:B. IgG4-related disease

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of IgG4-related disease. The patient's progressive bilateral nasal airway obstruction, crusting, and saddle nose deformity are consistent with the respiratory manifestations of IgG4-related disease. The patient's elevated complement C3 and total hemolytic complement (CH50) levels, as well as the presence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Bacteroides on nasal cultures, are also consistent with IgG4-related disease.

The patient's histopathologic findings, which include a prominent lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, angiocentric fibrosis with a relative lack of eosinophils, and increased IgG4 absolute count, are also consistent with IgG4-related disease. The slightly elevated IgG4-IgG ratio is not diagnostic of IgG4-related disease, but it can be seen in some cases.

Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (choice A) is a systemic vasculitis that can affect the respiratory system, but it is unlikely in this case given the absence of other systemic symptoms and the patient's negative medical history.

Eosinophilic angiocentric fibrosis (choice C) is a rare condition that can affect the nasal passages, but it is not typically associated with IgG4-related disease.

Chronic lymphoplasmacytic rhinosinusitis (choice D) is a common condition that can cause nasal obstruction and crusting, but it is not typically associated with IgG4-related disease.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and histopathologic findings, the most likely diagnosis is IgG4-related disease.

**Answer**:C. Urgent initiation of high-dose steroids, colchicine, and high-dose NSAIDs during hospitalization

The correct answer is C. Urgent initiation of high-dose steroids, colchicine, and high-dose NSAIDs during hospitalization.

The patient presented with chest pain, dyspnea, weight loss, and leukocytosis with eosinophilia, which suggests a possible diagnosis of myocardial infarction with cardiac tamponade. The cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed foci of delayed mid-myocardial gadolinium enhancement, diffuse pericardial thickening, severe biventricular systolic dysfunction, and a small pericardial effusion. These findings support the diagnosis of myocardial infarction and cardiac tamponade.

Option A, placing a percutaneous coronary stent in the left anterior descending artery, may be necessary for the treatment of coronary artery disease, but it does not address the urgent need for treatment of cardiac tamponade.

Option B, starting colchicine and NSAIDs with outpatient follow-up in 4 weeks, may be appropriate for the treatment of pericarditis, but it does not address the urgent need for treatment of cardiac tamponade.

Option D, urgently draining pericardial effusion percutaneously, may be necessary for the treatment of cardiac tamponade, but it does not address the underlying cause of the tamponade, which is likely due to the myocardial infarction.

In contrast, option C, urgently starting high-dose steroids, colchicine, and high-dose NSAIDs during hospitalization, addresses both the myocardial infarction and the cardiac tamponade. The steroids and NSAIDs can help reduce inflammation and alleviate pain, while colchicine can help reduce inflammation and prevent further cardiac damage.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Urgent initiation of high-dose steroids, colchicine, and high-dose

**Answer**:B. Erythema gyratum repens–like eruption associated with mycosis fungoides

The correct answer is B, Erythema gyratum repens–like eruption associated with mycosis fungoides, because the clinical presentation and histopathological findings described in the question are consistent with this diagnosis.

Erythema gyratum repens is a rare, chronic, inflammatory skin condition characterized by the development of concentric, annular, arcuate, and serpiginous red scaling plaques on the trunk and extremities. It is often associated with mycosis fungoides, a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

The patient in the question presented with a widespread, intermittently pruritic eruption that was diffusely involving the chest, back, and abdomen, with extension to proximal extremities. The clinical images showed concentric annular, arcuate, and serpiginous red scaling plaques, which is consistent with the characteristic presentation of erythema gyratum repens.

The histopathological findings also supported the diagnosis of mycosis fungoides. The skin biopsy showed epidermal hyperplasia with spongiosis and parakeratosis, which is a common feature of mycosis fungoides. Additionally, there was a superficial dermal and epidermotropic infiltrate of atypical lymphocytes, which is consistent with the infiltrate of malignant T cells seen in mycosis fungoides. The CD30 immunohistochemical stain highlighted the atypical lymphocytes, further supporting the diagnosis.

In contrast, the other answer choices do not fit the clinical and histopathological findings described in the question.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is C. Sickle cell testing.

The patient's symptoms of progressive, patchy iris atrophy and transillumination defects in both eyes, along with a family history of glaucoma, suggest the possibility of an inherited eye disorder. Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder that can affect the eyes and cause iris atrophy, among other ocular manifestations. Therefore, it is appropriate to test the patient for sickle cell disease to rule out this potential cause of his symptoms.

Anterior segment fluorescein angiography (Option A) may be useful in evaluating the patient's iris atrophy and transillumination defects, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case.

Aqueous tap (Option B) is not indicated in this case, as there is no evidence of elevated intraocular pressure or other signs of glaucoma.

Genetic testing (Option D) may also be considered, but it is not as specific or targeted as sickle cell testing, which is more likely to provide a definitive diagnosis or rule out a potential cause of the patient's symptoms.

Persistent hypoglossal artery because it is a known anatomical variation in which the hypoglossal artery fails to disappear during fetal development, resulting in a persistent artery that can be seen on imaging studies. The enhancing structure at the skull base along the carotid sheath, as seen in the provided computed tomography images, is consistent with a persistent hypoglossal artery.

A. Schwannoma is an incorrect choice because it is a benign tumor that arises from the supporting cells of the peripheral nervous system, typically seen in the head and neck region. While it may mimic the appearance of a blood vessel, it would not be located along the carotid sheath and would not have the same enhancement pattern as a blood vessel.

B. Paraganglioma is an incorrect choice because it is a rare tumor that arises from the paraganglia, which are clusters of cells located near the sympathetic ganglia. While it may also mimic the appearance of a blood vessel, it would not be located along the carotid sheath and would not have the same enhancement pattern as a blood vessel.

C. Persistent trigeminal artery is an incorrect choice because it is a rare anatomical variation in which the trigeminal artery fails to disappear during fetal development, resulting in a persistent artery that can be seen on imaging studies. However, the location of the enhancing structure in the provided images, along the carotid sheath, is not consistent with a persistent trigeminal artery, which would be located more anteriorly.

**Answer**:B. Perform MRI and MRA of the brain

The patient's symptoms of floaters, blurry vision, and eye pain, along with the physical examination findings of intraretinal hemorrhages, retinal neovascularization, and vascular nonperfusion, suggest a possible diagnosis of a retinal vasculature disorder. The patient's history of myopia and patchy hair loss also suggest a possible underlying systemic condition.

Option B, performing MRI and MRA of the brain, is the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation. The patient's symptoms of headaches, fever, and recurrence of facial rash, along with the physical examination findings of vascular nonperfusion and sheathing, suggest a possible diagnosis of a systemic vasculitis, such as antiphospholipid syndrome. An MRI and MRA of the brain would help to evaluate for any intracranial manifestations of vasculitis, such as stroke or dural sinus thrombosis, which could be causing the patient's symptoms. Additionally, an MRI and MRA would help to rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a central nervous system infection or tumor.

Option A, observing the patient, is not a sufficient next step in the patient's evaluation. While observation may be appropriate for some patients with retinal vasculature disorders, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a more urgent need for further evaluation.

Option C, performing a vitreous tap for viral polymerase chain reaction, may be appropriate in some cases of retinal vasculature disorders, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's evaluation. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest a viral etiology, and a vitreous tap would not help to evaluate for the possible systemic vasculitis that is suggested by the patient's history and physical examination findings.

Option D, administering an intravitreal injection of foscarnet, is also not the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation. While intravitreal injections may be appropriate for some patients with ret

**Answer**:B. Test for vitamin A deficiency, with additional conjunctival biopsies for pathologic evaluation and testing for immune deposits

The correct answer is B because it addresses the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, which is likely a vitamin A deficiency. The patient's history of hypothyroidism and recent use of brimonidine-timolol drops suggest a possible vitamin A deficiency. The patient's symptoms of progressive, diffuse redness and tearing in the left eye, along with the physical examination findings of keratinization of the conjunctiva, neovascular fronds, and shortening of the fornix, are consistent with a diagnosis of cicatricial disease.

Vitamin A deficiency is a known risk factor for cicatricial disease, and it is important to rule out this condition before proceeding with any surgical interventions. Testing for vitamin A deficiency and performing additional conjunctival biopsies for pathologic evaluation and testing for immune deposits can help confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.

Option A, starting treatment with frequent artificial tears, may provide some symptomatic relief, but it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Option C, observing the patient after stopping brimonidine-timolol drops without further intervention or evaluation, may also provide some symptomatic relief, but it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and may allow the condition to progress further. Option D, performing extensive excision of the lesion with ocular surface reconstruction, may be necessary in some cases, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's management, as it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and may not be necessary if the patient's condition can be managed medically.

D. Drug-induced vasculitis is the correct answer because the patient's symptoms, including the edematous and ulcerative eruption, nasolabial sparing, and systemic symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, and hematochezia, are consistent with a drug-induced vasculitis. The patient's history of taking multiple medications for 5 years, including simvastatin, chlorthalidone, hydralazine hydrochloride, lisinopril, and verapamil hydrochloride, increases the likelihood of a drug-induced vasculitis. Additionally, the biopsy findings of necrotizing vasculitis (Figure, C and D) support this diagnosis.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (choice A) is an unlikely diagnosis because the patient's symptoms do not include the characteristic respiratory symptoms, such as cough and hemoptysis, and there is no evidence of granulomas on biopsy. Cryptococcal infection (choice B) is also unlikely because the patient does not have any signs of meningitis or other fungal infections, and there is no evidence of cryptococcal antigen in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid. Sweet syndrome (choice C) is a possibility, but it is less likely than drug-induced vasculitis given the patient's age and the absence of any evidence of infection.

Therefore, D. Drug-induced vasculitis is the most appropriate answer.

**Answer**:A. Check ferritin and transferrin saturation

The patient's symptoms of bilateral hand pain along the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints, prolonged morning stiffness, and family history of osteoarthritis, hypogonadism, and type 2 diabetes, are consistent with a diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The patient's age and duration of symptoms also support this diagnosis.

Checking ferritin and transferrin saturation is appropriate because PsA is associated with an increased risk of developing iron deficiency anemia due to chronic inflammation. Ferritin is a protein that stores and releases iron in the body, and low levels of ferritin can indicate iron deficiency anemia. Transferrin saturation, on the other hand, measures the percentage of transferrin, a protein that carries iron in the blood, that is saturated with iron. Low levels of transferrin saturation can also indicate iron deficiency anemia.

Checking ferritin and transferrin saturation can help confirm the diagnosis of PsA and also identify a potential underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, such as anemia, which can impact the patient's quality of life and response to treatment.

The other choices are not appropriate for the following reasons:

B. Check rheumatoid factor (RF): RF is an antibody that is often elevated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, but it is not specific to PsA. While some patients with PsA may have elevated RF, it is not a diagnostic test for PsA.

C. Order magnetic resonance imaging of the sacroiliac joint: While MRI can be useful in evaluating joint damage in PsA, it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's evaluation. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of PsA, and checking ferritin and transferrin saturation can help confirm this diagnosis.

D. Refer for surgical consultation: Surgical consultation may be necessary in the future for joint repair or replacement, but it

**Answer**: A. Order cardiac magnetic resonance imaging

The correct answer is A, Order cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, because it is the most appropriate next step in the evaluation of this patient's symptoms. The patient has presented with decreased exercise tolerance, shortness of breath, and heart palpitations, which could be indicative of a cardiac condition. The physical examination findings of a fixed split S2 and a 2/6 systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border, along with the electrocardiogram (ECG) showing sinus rhythm with incomplete right bundle-branch block, suggest that there may be a cardiac issue that needs to be further evaluated.

A cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would provide more detailed information about the structure and function of the heart, which would help in diagnosing the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. It would also help to identify any potential cardiac abnormalities, such as a cardiomyopathy or a congenital heart defect, that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms.

In contrast, choice B, Start angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, is not the most appropriate next step in the evaluation of this patient's symptoms. While angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are commonly used to treat hypertension and heart failure, they are not typically used to treat cardiac murmurs or exercise intolerance without any underlying hypertension or heart failure diagnosis.

Choice C, Perform cardiac catheterization, is also not the most appropriate next step in the evaluation of this patient's symptoms. Cardiac catheterization is an invasive procedure that is typically reserved for patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease, and is not typically used to evaluate cardiac murmurs or exercise intolerance.

Choice D, Refer to pulmonologist, is also not the most appropriate next step in the evaluation of this patient's symptoms. While a pulmonologist may be involved in the care of a patient with lung disease, the patient's symptoms of decreased exercise tolerance, shortness of breath, and heart palpitations suggest that there may be a cardiac issue that

**Answer**:B. Chloroma

The patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and medical history all point to a diagnosis of chloroma, also known as myeloid sarcoma or granulocytic sarcoma. Chloroma is a rare extramedullary manifestation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which occurs when leukemic cells infiltrate and proliferate in extramedullary tissues. In this case, the patient's history of AML and recent allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant increase the likelihood of chloroma. The skin lesions described as green-gray nodules and plaques on the chest are consistent with the cutaneous manifestations of chloroma. The patient's lack of symptoms and negative lymph node examination also support this diagnosis.

Merkel cell carcinoma (A) is an aggressive skin cancer that typically affects the sun-exposed areas of the body and is rare in the chest region. It is unlikely to present with a green-gray color and would not explain the patient's history of AML or recent transplant.

Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (C) is a rare hematologic malignancy that can have cutaneous manifestations. However, it typically presents with red to violaceous papules or nodules, not green-gray lesions.

Histiocytoid Sweet syndrome (D) is a rare condition characterized by the infiltration of skin and other tissues by a unique population of histiocytes. It is not associated with AML or chloroma.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Chloroma.

**Answer**: A. Encephalomyelitis with hyperIgEaemia

The correct diagnosis for the patient described in the case is Encephalomyelitis with hyperIgEaemia. Encephalomyelitis is a general term that refers to inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. In this case, the patient's symptoms of dizziness, fatigue, tingling of both lower extremities, and gait disturbances, along with the physical examination findings of mild proximal pyramidal weakness, brisk reflexes, and hypoesthesia below the T2 level, are consistent with encephalomyelitis.

The patient's elevated eosinophil count and negative test results for B-cell clones, viral, and fungal infections, as well as the absence of skin lesions, suggest that the encephalomyelitis is not caused by an infection. The patient's history of mild intermittent whole-body itching starting 9 months prior to presentation also supports this diagnosis.

HyperIgEaemia, also known as hyperimmunoglobulinemia E, is a condition in which there is an abnormally high level of immunoglobulin E (IgE) in the blood. This can be seen in various conditions, including allergic disorders, parasitic infections, and certain autoimmune disorders. In the case of Encephalomyelitis with hyperIgEaemia, the high level of IgE is thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

B. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome): This is a systemic autoimmune disease that can cause inflammation of various organs, including the nervous system. However, the patient's lack of skin lesions and negative test results for B-cell clones, viral, and fungal infections make this diagnosis less likely.

The correct answer is C. Perform computed tomography angiography of the aorta.

The patient's symptoms of dysphagia and dyspnea, along with the radiographic findings of multiple exudative foci in both lungs, suggest a possible diagnosis of pulmonary disease. The patient's history of poorly controlled hypertension for 10 years increases the likelihood of a cardiovascular etiology. Computed tomography angiography of the aorta would be the most appropriate next step in evaluating the patient's symptoms, as it can help identify potential sources of pulmonary embolism, such as atherosclerosis or aneurysms, and would provide further information on the extent of lung involvement.

In contrast, endoscopy (choice A) would not be the most appropriate next step, as it would not provide information on the patient's pulmonary vasculature and would not help diagnose a cardiovascular etiology. Transesophageal echocardiogram (choice B) may be considered, but it would not provide the same level of detail as a CT angiogram and may not be able to fully evaluate the aorta and its branches. Right and left heart catheterization (choice D) would be an invasive procedure that may be necessary in the future, but it would not provide the same level of information as a CT angiogram and would carry a higher risk of complications.

**Answer**: B. Start topical corticosteroid eyedrops

The correct answer is B, Start topical corticosteroid eyedrops, because the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest that she has developed corneal edema, which is likely caused by an inflammatory response to the plant latex that she rubbed her eye with. Topical corticosteroid eyedrops can help to reduce the inflammation and alleviate the symptoms.

A, Intrastromal injection of anti–vascular endothelial growth factor, is not the best choice because the patient's condition does not require a treatment that targets vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Intrastromal injection of anti-VEGF is typically used to treat conditions such as age-related macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy, which are not relevant to this case.

C, Begin oral and/or topical antiviral medications, is also not the best choice because there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has a viral infection. While her symptoms may be similar to those of a viral infection, the history of exposure to plant latex and the examination findings suggest that the cause is more likely to be an allergic or irritative response.

D, Perform an endothelial keratoplasty, is not the best choice because this is a surgical procedure that is typically used to treat conditions such as Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy or bullous keratopathy, which are not relevant to this case. The patient's corneal edema is likely a reversible condition that can be treated with topical corticosteroids, and surgery is not necessary at this time.

**Answer**:C. Magnetic resonance angiography of the brain and neck

The correct answer is C. Magnetic resonance angiography of the brain and neck because it is the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic workup of this patient's acute ptosis.

A. Edrophonium test: This choice is incorrect because edrophonium is a drug that is used to test for myasthenia gravis, which is not indicated in this patient's presentation. The patient does not have any symptoms suggestive of myasthenia gravis, such as weakness or fatigue of the extraocular muscles, and the results of the initial examination do not suggest a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis.

B. Oculoplastic referral for ptosis repair: This choice is incorrect because it is not the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic workup of this patient's acute ptosis. While ptosis repair may ultimately be necessary, it is important to first determine the underlying cause of the ptosis. Magnetic resonance angiography of the brain and neck can help to identify potential causes of the ptosis, such as a cerebral vasospasm or a carotid artery dissection, which would need to be addressed before any surgical intervention.

D. Sumatriptan injection: This choice is incorrect because sumatriptan is a medication that is used to treat migraines and cluster headaches, which are not indicated in this patient's presentation. The patient does not have a history of headaches or migraines, and the results of the initial examination do not suggest a diagnosis of a headache disorder.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic workup of this patient's acute ptosis is C. Magnetic resonance angiography of the brain and neck. This test can help to identify potential causes of the ptosis, such as a cerebral vasospasm or a carotid artery dissection, which would need to be addressed before any surgical intervention.

**Answer**: B. Mastocytoma

The correct answer is B. Mastocytoma because it best fits the patient's symptoms and the histopathological findings described in the case.

A. Histiocytoma is an incorrect choice because it is a benign tumor that typically affects children, and the patient in this case is a 41-year-old man. Additionally, histiocytomas are usually composed of a mixture of histiocytes and lymphocytes, whereas the histopathology report in this case describes a dense cellular infiltrate composed of cells with round nuclei and abundant pale cytoplasm, which is more consistent with mastocytoma.

C. Malignant pheochromocytoma is an incorrect choice because it is a rare malignancy that arises from the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla. While it can present with symptoms similar to those described in the case, such as abdominal pain and flushing, it typically affects older adults and has a more aggressive clinical course. The histopathology report in this case does not mention any features suggestive of malignant pheochromocytoma.

D. Myeloid sarcoma is an incorrect choice because it is a rare malignancy that arises from the myeloid lineage of blood cells. While it can present with symptoms similar to those described in the case, such as abdominal pain and vomiting, it typically affects older adults and has a more aggressive clinical course. The histopathology report in this case does not mention any features suggestive of myeloid sarcoma.

In conclusion, based on the patient's symptoms and the histopathology report, the most likely diagnosis is mastocytoma, which is a benign tumor that arises from mast cells.

**Answer**:C. Perform a transscleral subretinal biopsy

The patient's symptoms and clinical findings, such as acute vision loss, retinal whitening, occlusive vasculitis, and elevated intraocular pressure, suggest a severe and progressive inflammatory process in the retina. The negative microbiological results suggest that the cause is unlikely to be an infection.

Option A, increasing systemic immunosuppressive therapy, may help to reduce the inflammation, but it does not address the underlying cause of the condition.

Option B, continuing intravitreal injections of antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral medications, may provide some benefit, but it is unlikely to be effective in treating a non-infectious condition.

Option D, repeated diagnostic vitrectomy with repeated subretinal biopsy in the left eye, may provide more tissue for analysis, but it is invasive and carries risks, and it may not provide a definitive diagnosis.

Option C, perform a transscleral subretinal biopsy, is a less invasive procedure that can provide a larger tissue sample for analysis, which may help to establish a definitive diagnosis and guide further management. Therefore, option C is the best answer.

**Answer**: C. Cutaneous leishmaniasis

Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a parasitic infection caused by the Leishmania protozoa, which is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected sandflies. The disease typically presents with skin lesions, which can be ulcerative or nodular, and may also have a central crust or scab.

In this case, the patient presented with an inflammatory erythematous plaque with a central shiny orange crust on the left index finger, which is consistent with the appearance of cutaneous leishmaniasis. The fact that the patient lived in a rural area on the Mediterranean coast, where sandflies are commonly found, further supports this diagnosis.

The other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms:

* A. Herpetic whitlow: This is a viral infection caused by the herpes simplex virus, which typically presents with a painful, fluid-filled blister on the finger. While the patient's lesion had a central crust, it was not consistent with the typical appearance of a herpetic whitlow.
* B. Bacterial paronychia: This is a bacterial infection of the nail fold, which can cause redness, swelling, and pus. However, the patient's lesion did not have the characteristic pus-filled appearance of a bacterial paronychia.
* D. Pyogenic granuloma: This is a benign growth that can occur in response to a variety of stimuli, including infection. However, the patient's lesion did not have the characteristic features of a pyogenic granuloma, such as a red, friable, and bleeding surface.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and history, cutaneous leishmaniasis is the most likely diagnosis.

**Answer**:B. Obtain polymerase chain reaction of aqueous humor for cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA

The patient's symptoms of painless vision loss, new keratic precipitates, and anterior chamber inflammation, along with the presence of coin-shaped lesions on the graft, suggest the possibility of cytomegalovirus (CMV) endotheliitis. CMV endotheliitis is a known complication of Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) and can cause graft failure if left untreated.

Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of aqueous humor for CMV DNA is the most appropriate next step in diagnosing CMV endotheliitis. PCR is a highly sensitive and specific test for detecting CMV DNA in aqueous humor, and a positive result would confirm the diagnosis of CMV endotheliitis.

Increasing the frequency or potency of steroids (choice A) may help to reduce inflammation, but it will not diagnose or treat the underlying cause of the inflammation, which is CMV endotheliitis.

Performing a vitreous tap with intravitreal antibiotic injection (choice C) may be necessary if there is a suspicion of bacterial or fungal endophthalmitis, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as there is no evidence of vitritis or infiltrates in the graft-host interface or capsular bag.

Initiating empirical treatment with acyclovir (choice D) may be effective in treating CMV endotheliitis, but it is not the most appropriate next step, as the diagnosis of CMV endotheliitis has not been confirmed. Acyclovir therapy may also have side effects, and it is important to establish a definitive diagnosis before initiating treatment.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Obtain polymerase chain reaction of aqueous humor for cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA.

A. Esthesioneuroblastoma is an uncommon nasal cavity tumor that typically affects younger patients and presents with nasal obstruction, bleeding, and facial pain. While it can cause frontal swelling, it is not typically associated with the patient's other symptoms, such as clear nasal discharge and progressive nontender facial swelling above the glabella.

B. Pott puffy tumor is a benign nasal tumor that usually affects children and young adults. It is characterized by a soft tissue mass in the nasal cavity and can cause nasal obstruction, bleeding, and discharge. However, it does not typically cause frontal swelling or the other symptoms described in the case.

D. Sinonasal neuroendocrine carcinoma is a rare malignancy that can arise in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. It can present with symptoms similar to those described in the case, such as nasal obstruction, bleeding, and facial pain. However, it typically affects younger patients and has a more aggressive clinical course than what is described in the case.

In contrast, sinonasal meningioma is a benign tumor that arises from the meninges, the protective covering of the brain and spinal cord. It can cause frontal swelling, nasal obstruction, and other symptoms described in the case. The imaging findings of a soft tissue mass anterior to the axilla of the middle turbinates bilaterally, with normal-appearing mucosa overlying, are also consistent with sinonasal meningioma. The pathology results of uniform, epithelioid cells arranged in a whorled, lobulated growth pattern without atypia, necrosis, increased cellularity, or diffuse growth pattern are also consistent with this diagnosis.

**Answer**: B. Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma

The patient's history of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma and the presence of a left thyroid mass that is positive for p16 and negative for TTF-1 suggest that the thyroid mass is a metastasis from the patient's previous squamous cell carcinoma. This is supported by the patient's history of smoking and the presence of bilateral cervical adenopathy.

A. Papillary thyroid carcinoma is unlikely because the patient's thyroid mass is not typical of papillary thyroid carcinoma, which typically presents as a small, nodular lesion in the thyroid gland. Additionally, the patient's history of smoking and the presence of bilateral cervical adenopathy suggest a more aggressive cancer, such as squamous cell carcinoma.

C. Thyroid lymphoma is unlikely because the patient's thyroid mass is not typical of thyroid lymphoma, which typically presents as a rapidly growing, painless mass in the neck. Additionally, the patient's history of smoking and the presence of bilateral cervical adenopathy suggest a more aggressive cancer, such as squamous cell carcinoma.

D. Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is unlikely because the patient's thyroid mass is not typical of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, which typically presents as a rapidly growing, painless mass in the neck with a rough, irregular surface. Additionally, the patient's history of smoking and the presence of bilateral cervical adenopathy suggest a more aggressive cancer, such as squamous cell carcinoma.

Therefore, based on the patient's history and the characteristics of the thyroid mass, the most likely diagnosis is metastatic squamous cell carcinoma.

**Answer**:A. Diagnose the patient with PAD and begin medical management

The patient's symptoms of exertional left calf discomfort, which worsened over time and interfered with her work, are consistent with peripheral artery disease (PAD). The patient's history of hypertension and age also increase her risk for PAD. The exercise treadmill ankle-brachial index (ABI) test results show a significant drop in the ankle-brachial index (ABI) during exercise, indicating a decrease in blood flow to the lower extremities, which is consistent with PAD.

Therefore, the correct answer is A: Diagnose the patient with PAD and begin medical management.

B: Order a lower extremity angiogram, is not the correct answer as it would be an invasive test that may not be necessary at this stage, and medical management should be initiated first.

C: Order a lower extremity arterial duplex ultrasound, is not the correct answer as it would not provide information on the patient's blood flow during exercise, which is an important factor in diagnosing PAD.

D: Reassure the patient that her pain is nonvascular in origin, is not the correct answer as the patient's symptoms are consistent with PAD and further evaluation and management are necessary.

**Answer**:A. Perform laparoscopic appendectomy and peritoneal biopsy

The correct answer is A, Perform laparoscopic appendectomy and peritoneal biopsy, because it is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's symptoms and diagnosis.

The patient presents with a history of uterine carcinoma, which increases the likelihood of a gynecological origin for the current symptoms. The patient's abdominal pain and distension, along with the presence of pelvic ascites and an enhancing lesion at the base of the cecum, suggest a possible intra-abdominal malignancy. The lack of leukocytosis and normal differential count on complete blood cell count suggests that the patient does not have an acute infection, which makes broad-spectrum antibiotics unnecessary at this time.

Option A, Perform laparoscopic appendectomy and peritoneal biopsy, allows for a definitive diagnosis of the patient's symptoms and lesion, while also providing the opportunity for potential curative treatment. Laparoscopic appendectomy is a minimally invasive procedure that can help to confirm the presence of appendiceal cancer and allow for removal of the affected organ. Peritoneal biopsy can also be performed during the same procedure to help determine the extent of disease and potential for further treatment.

Option B, Order repeat image-guided paracentesis/cytology, may not provide a definitive diagnosis and may not be necessary given the patient's symptoms and imaging findings. While paracentesis can help to diagnose ascites, it may not provide sufficient tissue for a definitive diagnosis of the underlying malignancy.

Option C, Order colonoscopy with biopsy, may not be necessary at this time, as the patient's symptoms and imaging findings suggest a possible appendiceal origin for the malignancy. Colonoscopy may not provide adequate visualization of the appendix or surrounding tissue to make a definitive diagnosis.

**Answer**: A. Sporotrichosis

The correct answer is A. Sporotrichosis because it is a fungal infection caused by Sporothrix schenckii, which typically presents with a painless, slowly growing, well-circumscribed plaque on the skin, often with a history of trauma to the affected area. The patient's history of a prior injury to the elbow and the presence of a solitary, well-circumscribed pink plaque with overlying yellow-white micaceous scale and interspersed punctate hemorrhagic crusts are consistent with Sporotrichosis.

B. Koebnerized psoriasis vulgaris is an incorrect choice because while Koebner phenomenon (isomorphic response) can occur in psoriasis, it typically presents with linear or guttate lesions, not a solitary plaque. Additionally, psoriasis typically has a positive family history, which is not mentioned in the patient's history.

C. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is an incorrect choice because while GPA can present with skin lesions, they are typically papulonodular and not plaque-like. Additionally, GPA is a systemic vasculitis that affects multiple organs, including the lungs, kidneys, and nervous system, which is not consistent with the patient's history of an isolated skin lesion.

D. Sarcoidosis is an incorrect choice because while it can present with skin lesions, they are typically papulonodular and not plaque-like. Additionally, sarcoidosis is a systemic disease that affects multiple organs, including the lungs, lymph nodes, and eyes, which is not consistent with the patient's history of an isolated skin lesion.

**Answer**: C. Initiate venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation

Explanation:

The patient in the scenario has experienced a cardiac arrest and is in asystole, indicating that their heart has stopped functioning. This means that they are not receiving enough oxygen to their body, and their organs are at risk of damage due to lack of oxygenation.

Option C, initiating venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VA ECMO), is the correct answer because it addresses the patient's lack of oxygenation by taking over the work of their heart and lungs. VA ECMO is a technique that uses a machine to perform the work of the heart and lungs, by removing carbon dioxide from the blood and adding oxygen to it, outside of the body. This can help to restore oxygenation to the patient's body and prevent further damage to their organs.

Option A, inserting a percutaneous left ventricular assist device, is not the correct answer because it is not immediately necessary in this scenario. While a left ventricular assist device can help to support the heart's function, it is not a solution for the patient's immediate need for oxygenation.

Option B, performing pericardiocentesis with autologous blood transfusion, is also not the correct answer. Pericardiocentesis is a procedure that involves removing fluid from the sac surrounding the heart, but it is not a solution for the patient's lack of oxygenation. Autologous blood transfusion, or transfusing the patient's own blood back into their body, may be necessary in some cases, but it is not the most appropriate option in this scenario.

Option D, performing root and ascending aortography, is not the correct answer because it is not immediately relevant to the patient's condition. Aortography is a procedure that involves injecting dye into the aorta to visualize it, but it is not a solution for the patient's lack of oxygenation.

Therefore, the correct answer is C, initiating venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.

Sure! Here's my explanation:

**Answer**: B. Chondroid metaplasia

The patient's symptoms of dysphonia, throat tightness, and vocal effort, along with the physical examination findings of moderate to severe dysphonia with predominant roughness and strain, suggest a vocal cord lesion. The patient's history of heavy voice use and asthma treated with inhaled steroids also support this diagnosis.

The videostroboscopy findings of fungal laryngitis and residual fullness of the left false vocal fold and appearance of prolapsed ventricular mucosa obstructing the lateral extent of the left true vocal fold are consistent with a vocal cord lesion. The reduction of lateral excursion of the mucosal wave on the left also suggests a lesion affecting the lateral vocal cord.

The computed tomography scan with contrast showed no specific abnormalities, which suggests that the lesion is likely benign.

The direct laryngoscopy findings of a firm lesion in the left paraglottic space extending to the lateral aspect of the true vocal fold, which was removed using an AcuBlade CO2 laser, are consistent with a chondroid metaplasia. The histologic specimen showing fragments of cartilage with no nuclear atypia or mitosis supports this diagnosis.

Chondroid metaplasia is a benign condition where there is a transformation of the epithelium of the vocal cord into cartilage. It is often associated with vocal cord lesions and can cause dysphonia.

The other answer choices are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings.

A. Saccular cyst: A saccular cyst is a rare benign lesion that can occur in the larynx. It is typically a small, soft, and pedunculated mass that does not cause significant symptoms. The patient's symptoms of dysphonia, throat tightness, and vocal effort, as well as the physical examination findings, do not suggest a saccular cyst.

**Answer**:B. Oral melanoacanthosis (melanoacanthoma)

The correct answer is B, Oral melanoacanthosis (melanoacanthoma), for the following reasons:

A. Focal melanotic macule (focal melanosis): This diagnosis is incorrect because the lesion described in the case is not a small, well-defined patch of pigmentation, but rather a larger, irregularly shaped area of pigmentation. Additionally, the histopathology findings do not support this diagnosis, as there is no evidence of increased melanin production in the epithelium.

C. Blue nevus: This diagnosis is incorrect because the lesion described in the case does not have the characteristic blue or blue-gray color of a blue nevus. Additionally, the histopathology findings do not support this diagnosis, as there is no evidence of a nevus with a characteristic "spider-web" or "swirling" pattern.

D. Malignant melanoma: This diagnosis is incorrect because the histopathology findings do not support this diagnosis. Malignant melanoma would typically show evidence of increased melanin production, irregular nuclei, and a high mitotic rate, none of which are present in this case. Additionally, the lesion described in the case is not a rapidly growing, invasive tumor, which is typical of malignant melanoma.

Therefore, the correct answer is B, Oral melanoacanthosis (melanoacanthoma), as it best fits the clinical and histopathological findings described in the case. Oral melanoacanthosis is a benign condition characterized by an increase in melanin-producing cells in the epithelium, which can result in a brown or black pigmentation of the mucosa. The histopathology findings of numerous benign dendritic melanocytes throughout the epithelium support this diagnosis.

**Answer**: A. Schwannoma

A Schwannoma, also known as a neurilemmoma, is a benign tumor that originates from the supporting cells of the nervous system called Schwann cells. It is the most common type of peripheral nerve sheath tumor. The patient's symptoms of progressive unilateral lower lip and chin numbness, as well as the ipsilateral facial fullness, are consistent with a Schwannoma affecting the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve (V3). The location of the lesion in the left masticator space, which appears to be centered in the lateral pterygoid muscle, is also consistent with a Schwannoma.

B. Juvenile angiofibroma is a rare benign tumor that typically affects the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. It is usually seen in young males and can cause symptoms such as nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and headaches. While it can cause facial numbness, it is not typically associated with a unilateral lower lip and chin numbness.

C. Odontogenic keratocyst is a type of dental cyst that arises from the remnants of the dental lamina. It typically affects the mandible and maxilla and can cause symptoms such as swelling, pain, and teeth displacement. While it can cause facial numbness, it is not typically associated with a unilateral lower lip and chin numbness.

D. Chondrosarcoma is a malignant tumor that arises from the cartilage cells. It can affect various parts of the body, including the head and neck. However, it is not typically associated with a unilateral lower lip and chin numbness.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and the location of the lesion, the most likely diagnosis is a Schwannoma.

**Answer**: B. Metastatic carotid body tumors

The correct answer is B, Metastatic carotid body tumors, because the patient's symptoms and imaging findings are consistent with this diagnosis.

The patient presents with a palpable mass in the neck that has been present for several months and has not changed despite antibiotic treatment. This suggests that the mass is not infectious in nature, but rather a tumor. The location of the mass, at the carotid bifurcation, is also consistent with a carotid body tumor.

The imaging findings also support this diagnosis. The contrast-enhanced neck CT shows a large, avidly enhancing mass centered at the left carotid bifurcation, which is consistent with a carotid body tumor. The displacement of the left internal jugular vein posteriorly is also consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the presence of a smaller mass at the right carotid bifurcation suggests that this is a metastatic lesion.

The positive gallium Ga 68 dotatate positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings also support this diagnosis, as they demonstrate intense radiotracer avidity in bilateral carotid space masses, hepatic masses, and numerous CT occult osseous lesions. This suggests that the tumor has spread beyond the carotid body and is now present in other parts of the body, such as the liver and bones.

In contrast, the other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.

A, Metastatic glomus vagale tumors, is unlikely because the patient does not have a history of glomus vagale tumors, and the location of the mass at the carotid bifurcation is not typical for glomus vagale tumors.

C, Metastatic sarcoma, is also unlikely because the patient does not have a history of sarcoma, and the imaging findings do not suggest a soft tissue mass consistent with sarcoma.

D, Lymphoma, is unlikely

**Answer**:C. Order optical coherence tomography

Explanation:

C. Order optical coherence tomography is the correct answer because it is a non-invasive imaging test that can provide detailed information about the retina and macula, which can help diagnose and monitor diseases such as macular edema, retinal thinning, and choroidal neovascularization. In this case, the patient presented with bilateral central vision loss, and the clinical findings of bilateral reddened foveal lesions and irregular macular pigmentation suggest a possible retinal or choroidal disease. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) can help to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.

A. Obtain indocyanine green angiography is not the correct answer because it is an invasive test that requires the injection of a dye into the bloodstream, which may not be necessary at this stage of the patient's evaluation. Additionally, indocyanine green angiography is primarily used to evaluate the retinal vasculature and may not provide information about the macula.

B. Discontinue immunosuppression therapy is not the correct answer because the patient's symptoms and examination findings do not suggest an adverse effect of immunosuppression therapy. The patient's history of Crohn disease and the use of ustekinumab (Stelara) suggest that immunosuppression therapy may be necessary to control the patient's underlying condition.

D. Repeat neuroimaging is not the correct answer because the patient's symptoms and examination findings do not suggest a neurological disorder. The patient's bilateral central vision loss and macular findings suggest a possible retinal or choroidal disease, which can be evaluated with OCT. Repeating neuroimaging may not provide additional information and may delay the diagnosis and treatment of the patient's condition.

**Answer**:C. Obtain venography (computed tomography or magnetic resonance) of the brain

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest that he may have increased intracranial pressure (ICP), which can cause bilateral optic nerve edema. The diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is possible, but other causes of increased ICP, such as a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, should also be considered.

A. Obtain enhanced depth imaging–optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT): While EDI-OCT can provide valuable information about the retinal nerve fiber layer and optic nerve head, it is not the most appropriate test to diagnose the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. EDI-OCT is useful in diagnosing and monitoring conditions such as glaucoma, but it does not provide information about the cerebral venous system or intracranial pressure.

B. Perform lumbar puncture with opening pressure: Lumbar puncture can be used to diagnose IIH by measuring the opening pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is typically elevated in IIH. However, this test is not appropriate at this stage of the patient's evaluation, as it does not provide information about the cerebral venous system or potential other causes of increased ICP.

D. Prescribe acetazolamide: Acetazolamide is a medication that can be used to treat IIH by reducing the production of CSF. However, it is not the most appropriate step in the patient's evaluation, as it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and may not be effective in all cases of increased ICP.

C. Obtain venography (computed tomography or magnetic resonance) of the brain: Venography is a diagnostic test that can provide information about the cerebral venous system and potential causes of increased ICP, such as a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. This test can help to determine the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and guide further management. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

**Answer**: B. Assess serum vitamin B12 and folate levels

The patient's symptoms of gradual vision loss, bilateral optic nerve hyperemia, blurred margins, and subtle telangiectatic vessels on the surface of the optic nerve suggest a possible diagnosis of tobacco-alcohol amblyopia, also known as tobacco-alcohol-related optic neuropathy. This condition is caused by a combination of tobacco and alcohol use, which leads to a deficiency in vitamin B12 and folate.

Therefore, assessing the patient's serum vitamin B12 and folate levels is the most appropriate next step in diagnosing and managing this condition. If the patient's vitamin B12 and folate levels are found to be low, supplementation with these nutrients may help to improve the patient's vision.

The other answer choices do not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and are therefore not the most appropriate next steps:

A. Liver function tests: While the patient's history of heavy alcohol consumption may suggest liver dysfunction, there is no evidence to suggest that the patient's vision loss is related to liver disease. Liver function tests may be appropriate at a later stage, but they are not the most relevant test at this point.

C. Treatment with disulfiram: Disulfiram is a medication used to treat alcohol use disorder by causing an unpleasant reaction when alcohol is consumed. While it may be appropriate to consider treatment for the patient's alcohol use disorder, there is no evidence to suggest that disulfiram would address the underlying cause of the patient's vision loss.

D. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain: While MRI of the brain may be appropriate to rule out other causes of vision loss, such as a brain tumor or stroke, it is not the most relevant test at this point. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a specific diagnosis of tobacco-alcohol amblyopia, which can be confirmed with a simple blood test to assess vitamin B12 and folate levels

**Answer**:C. Stop netarsudil in both eyes

The patient's symptoms of pain and worsening vision in the right eye, along with the physical examination findings of diffuse microcystoid epithelial and stromal edema in both eyes, worsening reticular changes in the right eye, and high pressures, suggest a diagnosis of netarsudil-associated reticular epithelial edema. This is a known side effect of netarsudil, a medication used to treat glaucoma.

Option A, stopping timolol in the right eye, may help to reduce the pressure in the right eye, but it would not address the underlying cause of the reticular epithelial edema.

Option B, stopping latanoprost in both eyes, may also help to reduce the pressure in both eyes, but it would not address the underlying cause of the reticular epithelial edema.

Option D, resuming dorzolamide in the right eye, may help to reduce the pressure in the right eye, but it would not address the underlying cause of the reticular epithelial edema. Additionally, dorzolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, which can cause a decrease in corneal endothelial function, and may worsen the corneal edema.

Therefore, the best option is C, stopping netarsudil in both eyes, which would address the underlying cause of the reticular epithelial edema and prevent further worsening of the condition.

**Answer**:D. Start vasodilator therapy with nifedipine

The correct answer is D. Start vasodilator therapy with nifedipine, as it is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's condition.

The patient presents with symptoms of Raynaud's phenomenon, a condition characterized by recurrent episodes of digital vasospasm, which can lead to ischemia and ulcerations. The patient's positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and high positive anti-Ro52, anti-Ro60, and anti–Scl-70 antibodies suggest a possible diagnosis of systemic sclerosis, a connective tissue disorder that can cause vasculopathy and digital ulcerations.

Option D, starting vasodilator therapy with nifedipine, is the most appropriate next step because it addresses the patient's symptoms of digital vasospasm and ulcerations. Nifedipine is a calcium channel blocker that dilates blood vessels, reducing the vascular resistance and improving blood flow to the digits. This can help to alleviate the symptoms of Raynaud's phenomenon and prevent further digital ulcerations.

Option A, giving intravenous pulse-dose methylprednisolone, may be considered for its anti-inflammatory effects, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. While corticosteroids can have some benefits in treating systemic sclerosis, they are not the primary treatment for Raynaud's phenomenon.

Option B, initiating therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin, may be appropriate for patients with systemic sclerosis who have a high risk of developing pulmonary arterial hypertension, but it is not the most appropriate next step for this patient's current symptoms.

Option C, starting empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, is not the most appropriate next step, as there is no evidence of infection in the patient's history or physical examination.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Start vasodilator therapy with nifedipine.

**Answer**: A. Plaque and ichthyosiform sarcoidosis

The correct answer is A, Plaque and ichthyosiform sarcoidosis, because the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with this diagnosis.

Sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect various organs, including the skin. Plaque and ichthyosiform sarcoidosis are two different forms of cutaneous sarcoidosis. Plaque sarcoidosis is characterized by raised, well-defined, round or oval lesions on the skin, while ichthyosiform sarcoidosis is characterized by thick, scaly, and irregularly shaped lesions.

In this case, the patient presented with erythematous and scaly plaques on her lower legs that spread proximally to the upper thighs, as well as new lesions on her arms and abdomen. The plaques were asymptomatic, but the patient experienced lower extremity edema and weakness, resulting in difficulty ambulating and frequent falls. These symptoms are consistent with plaque and ichthyosiform sarcoidosis.

The patient's neurological examination showed symmetric 4/5 strength and decreased reflexes in her lower extremities, which is consistent with peripheral neuropathy, a common complication of sarcoidosis. Sensation to light touch and proprioception were also diminished below the knee.

The histopathological findings of granulomatous inflammation throughout the dermis with mild hyperparakeratosis around a hair follicle and well-formed, epithelioid granulomas are also consistent with sarcoidosis.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and histopathological results, the most likely diagnosis is plaque and ichthyosiform sarcoidosis.

**Answer**: C. Unilesional folliculotropic mycosis fungoides

The correct answer is C. Unilesional folliculotropic mycosis fungoides because it most closely matches the symptoms and test results described in the case.

Mycosis fungoides is a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that typically presents with erythematous, scaly, and pruritic patches or plaques on the skin. In this case, the patient presented with a 1-year history of a pruritic, dark red plaque on his right upper eyelid, which is consistent with mycosis fungoides.

The histopathologic examination revealed perifollicular lymphocytic infiltrates around cystically dilated follicular infundibula and exocytosis of atypical lymphocytes into the epithelium, with admixed plasma cells, eosinophils, and multinucleate giant cells. These findings are consistent with mycosis fungoides, which is characterized by the infiltration of malignant T cells into the skin, particularly around hair follicles.

The immunohistochemical analysis showed lymphocytic infiltrates positive for CD3, CD4, CD5, and CD7 and negative for CD8, CD20, CD30, CD79a, and CD56. The ratio of CD4 to CD8 cells within hair follicles was greater than 7:1, which is consistent with mycosis fungoides. Monoclonal T-cell gene rearrangement was also demonstrated, which supports the diagnosis of mycosis fungoides.

In contrast, discoid lupus erythematosus (choice A) typically presents with discoid lesions on the scalp, face, and ears, and is characterized by the presence of autoantibodies and immune complexes. Facial papules in frontal fibrosing alopecia (choice B) typically present with papules and nodules on the scalp, eyebrows, and beard area, and are associated with fibrosing alopecia

**Answer**:C. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy

The patient's symptoms of gradual vision loss, confusion, and difficulty with word finding, along with the MRI findings of T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensity in the left occipital and temporal lobes, crossing the corpus callosum and extending into the right occipital lobe without enhancement, are consistent with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). PML is a viral infection that affects the brain and is caused by the John Cunningham virus (JCV), which is a common virus that affects the brain and is caused by the John Cunningham virus (JCV). It is more common in people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS, cancer, or taking immunosuppressive drugs.

Breast cancer, option A, is not a likely diagnosis given the patient's history of follicular lymphoma and the absence of any breast mass or lesion on MRI.

Central nervous system lymphoma, option B, is also less likely, as the patient's history of follicular lymphoma and the MRI findings do not support this diagnosis.

Glioma, option D, is unlikely given the patient's age and the absence of any mass or lesion on MRI.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.

The correct answer is C. Obtain chest radiographs.

Let's go through each answer choice and explain why it's incorrect or correct:

A. Place a transvenous pacing device:
This choice is incorrect because the patient already has a dual-chamber pacemaker implanted, and placing a transvenous pacing device would not address the abnormal ECG result. Additionally, the patient's symptoms and vital signs are stable, and there's no indication for emergency pacing.

B. Begin transcutaneous pacing:
This choice is incorrect for the same reason as A. The patient already has a pacemaker implanted, and transcutaneous pacing would not be necessary or effective in this case.

D. Place a magnet on the pulse generator:
This choice is incorrect because it's not appropriate to place a magnet on the pulse generator in this situation. The patient's pacemaker is not malfunctioning, and there's no indication for magnet placement.

C. Obtain chest radiographs:
This choice is correct because it's important to evaluate the patient's pacemaker and ensure that it's properly positioned and functioning correctly. Chest radiographs can help identify any issues with the pacemaker, such as displacement or malposition, and guide further management.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Obtain chest radiographs.

**Answer**:A. Kaposi sarcoma

Kaposi sarcoma is a type of cancer that affects the skin and lymphatic system. It is caused by a virus called human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8). People with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS, are more susceptible to developing Kaposi sarcoma.

The patient in the case presentation has a history of treatment-naive HIV and untreated syphilis, which suggests that their immune system is weakened. The presence of violaceous nodules on the base of the tongue and lower extremities, as well as the obstructive laryngeal mass, are consistent with the skin and lymphatic system involvement seen in Kaposi sarcoma.

The histopathological findings of a subepithelial spindle cell lesion with extravasation of erythrocytes and strong staining for HHV-8 also support the diagnosis of Kaposi sarcoma.

In contrast, syphilitic gumma (choice B) is a type of granuloma that forms in response to Treponema pallidum, the bacteria that cause syphilis. While the patient does have a history of untreated syphilis, the absence of any other signs of syphilis, such as rash or lymphadenopathy, makes this diagnosis less likely.

Bacillary angiomatosis (choice C) is a rare condition caused by the bacteria Bartonella henselae. It is characterized by the formation of vascular lesions that can mimic Kaposi sarcoma. However, the presence of violaceous nodules and the absence of any other signs of Bacillary angiomatosis, such as fever or lymphadenopathy, make this diagnosis less likely.

Angiosarcoma (choice D) is a type of cancer that arises from the endothelial cells that line blood vessels. While it can cause obstructive lesions in the larynx, the presence of violaceous nodules and the histopathological findings of a subepithelial spindle cell lesion with extravasation of eryth

**Answer**:C. Secretory carcinoma

The correct answer is C. Secretory carcinoma because it best matches the histologic findings described in the case.

The histologic findings described in the case include a microcystic and papillary architecture, abundant bubbly secretion within these microcystic spaces, and positivity for periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain. These features are consistent with the diagnosis of secretory carcinoma, which is a type of salivary gland carcinoma that is characterized by the production of abundant secretion.

In contrast, acinic cell carcinoma (choice A) typically has a more solid growth pattern and does not have the microcystic and papillary architecture described in the case. Adenocarcinoma, not otherwise specified (choice B), is a general term that encompasses a variety of carcinomas that arise in glandular tissue, but it does not specifically match the histologic features described in the case. Low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma (choice D) is a type of salivary gland carcinoma that is characterized by a low-grade proliferation of epithelial cells and is typically associated with a better prognosis than secretory carcinoma. However, it does not match the histologic features described in the case, which include a higher grade proliferation of epithelial cells and the production of abundant secretion.

Therefore, based on the histologic findings described in the case, the most appropriate diagnosis is secretory carcinoma, which is choice C.

**Answer**: C. Excisional biopsy

The correct answer is C. Excisional biopsy because it is the most appropriate next step in the management of the patient's condition.

The patient presents with a 9-day history of a progressively enlarging right lower eyelid lesion, which suggests a possible diagnosis of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection. The lesion is ulcerated, marginal, and associated with facial numbness, which are all consistent with VZV. The patient has already been treated with oral antibiotics and topical tobramycin without improvement, which suggests that the lesion is unlikely to be a bacterial infection.

Excisional biopsy is the best next step because it will allow for a definitive diagnosis of VZV infection and guide further management. The biopsy will also help to rule out other possible causes of the lesion, such as a squamous cell carcinoma or a basal cell carcinoma.

The other answer choices are not as appropriate for the following reasons:

A. Continued antibiotic therapy: As the patient has already been treated with antibiotics without improvement, it is unlikely that continuing antibiotic therapy will be effective in managing the lesion.

B. Wound debridement: Wound debridement may be necessary in some cases of VZV infection, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. The lesion is not severely ulcerated, and debridement may not be necessary at this stage.

D. Computed tomography scan of the orbits: A CT scan of the orbits may be necessary in some cases of VZV infection to evaluate for possible complications such as orbital cellulitis or abscess, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient does not have any symptoms or signs suggestive of orbital involvement, and a CT scan would not provide a definitive diagnosis of VZV infection.

Therefore, C. Excisional biopsy is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's condition.

**Answer**:C. Administer high-dose oral valacyclovir (2 g, 3 times daily)

The correct answer is C. Administer high-dose oral valacyclovir (2 g, 3 times daily) for the following reasons:

A. Administer systemic corticosteroids:
Corticosteroids are commonly used to treat optic neuritis, but they are not the most appropriate choice for this patient. The patient's symptoms have rapidly progressed over a short period, and the fundus examination reveals extensive retinal hemorrhages, which suggest a more aggressive and potentially vision-threatening condition. Corticosteroids may not be effective in halting the progression of the disease, and they may also mask the symptoms, making it difficult to monitor the patient's condition.

B. Treat with an intraocular corticosteroid injection:
While intraocular corticosteroid injections can be effective in treating optic neuritis, they may not be the best choice for this patient. The patient's symptoms are not limited to the optic nerve, and the fundus examination reveals widespread retinal changes. An intraocular corticosteroid injection may not effectively address the systemic nature of the disease.

D. Administer intramuscular benzathine penicillin G (2.4 million units):
Penicillin is not indicated for the treatment of optic neuritis or retinal vaso-occlusive disease. While it is possible that the patient may have a concurrent bacterial infection, the presence of retinal hemorrhages and the rapid progression of the disease suggest a more aggressive and potentially vision-threatening condition.

C. Administer high-dose oral valacyclovir (2 g, 3 times daily):
Valacyclovir is an antiviral medication that is effective against herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV).

**Answer**:A. Obtain a full-field electroretinogram

Explanation:
A full-field electroretinogram (ERG) is a diagnostic test that measures the electrical activity of the retina in response to light stimulation. It provides information about the function of the photoreceptors, bipolar cells, and retinal pigment epithelium. In this case, the patient's symptoms of peripheral vision loss, night blindness, and difficulty with color perception suggest a retinal degeneration. The fundus examination findings of vascular attenuation, optic nerve pallor, and peripheral hypoautofluorescence also support this diagnosis.

The full-field ERG can help to confirm the diagnosis of retinal degeneration and differentiate between various types of retinal diseases. It can also provide information about the severity and progression of the disease, which can help guide treatment decisions.

In contrast, serology testing to measure vitamins A, B1, B12, and folate (choice B) may be useful in certain cases of retinal degeneration, but it is not the most appropriate test in this scenario. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a more advanced stage of retinal degeneration, and serology testing may not provide sufficient information to guide management.

Performing a magnetic resonance image scan of the brain (choice C) may be considered in cases of suspected central nervous system involvement, but it is not directly related to the patient's symptoms and examination findings.

Performing fluorescein angiography (choice D) may be useful in certain cases of retinal disease, but it is not the most appropriate test in this scenario. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a degenerative condition, and fluorescein angiography may not provide sufficient information to guide management.

Therefore, obtaining a full-field electroretinogram (choice A) is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient.

**Answer**: D. Computed tomography scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest the presence of iris cysts in both eyes. The patient's unawareness of any recent changes in the size or number of these lesions, along with the presence of progressive visual obscuration in his left eye, indicate that the cysts may be growing and potentially causing vision loss.

The correct answer, D. Computed tomography scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, is necessary to rule out any systemic causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a metastatic disease. The patient's history of β-blocker use and the presence of iris cysts in both eyes suggest that the cysts may be associated with a systemic condition, such as a primary or metastatic tumor. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis would help to identify any potential systemic lesions and guide further management.

Option A, surgical iridectomy, is not the next step in management. While surgical removal of the cysts may be considered in the future, it is not appropriate at this time, as the patient's symptoms and examination findings do not indicate an emergency situation, and further diagnostic testing is needed to determine the underlying cause of the cysts.

Option B, kidney ultrasonography, is not relevant to the patient's symptoms or potential diagnosis. There is no indication of kidney disease or dysfunction, and this test would not provide useful information in the patient's case.

Option C, positron emission tomography (PET) scan, may be considered in the future if the patient's condition warrants further evaluation for a potential malignancy. However, a PET scan is not the most appropriate next step in management, as it would not provide the same level of detail as a CT scan and may not be able to detect small lesions.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Computed tomography scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis.

**Answer**: D. Perform right upper lobe resection

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and radiologic findings suggest a possible diagnosis of a cavitary lung mass, which can be caused by various etiologies such as infection, inflammation, or malignancy. The patient's history of smoking and poorly controlled diabetes mellitus increases the likelihood of a lung infection. The presence of a tension pneumothorax and charcoal-colored pleural fluid suggests a possible lung abscess.

Option A, changing antimicrobial therapy to meropenem and vancomycin, may be appropriate if the patient's condition worsens or if there is evidence of a bacterial infection. However, it is not the most appropriate next step at this time.

Option B, changing voriconazole to liposomal amphotericin B, may be appropriate if the patient's condition worsens or if there is evidence of a fungal infection. However, it is not the most appropriate next step at this time.

Option C, consulting radiation oncology immediately, may be appropriate if the patient's condition worsens or if there is evidence of a malignancy. However, it is not the most appropriate next step at this time.

Option D, performing right upper lobe resection, is the most appropriate next step. The patient's symptoms and radiologic findings suggest a possible diagnosis of a cavitary lung mass, which can be caused by various etiologies such as infection, inflammation, or malignancy. The presence of a tension pneumothorax and charcoal-colored pleural fluid suggests a possible lung abscess. Surgical intervention is necessary to diagnose and treat the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. A right upper lobe resection would allow for the removal of the cavitary mass and would provide a tissue sample for further histopathological examination to determine the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

Therefore, option D, performing right upper lobe resection, is the correct answer.

**Answer**: B. Actinic prurigo cheilitis

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with actinic prurigo cheilitis. The patient's history of generalized pruritus for 10 years, with no other medical history, suggests a chronic condition that affects the skin. The physical examination findings of erythematous papules, crusted lesions, and excoriations on the trunk and upper extremities, as well as scales, fissures, and crusts on the lower lip, are all consistent with actinic prurigo cheilitis. The fact that the patient had been treated with topical corticosteroids without relief also supports this diagnosis.

Actinic prurigo cheilitis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that affects sun-exposed areas, particularly the lower lip. It is characterized by the formation of crusts, scales, and fissures, which can be painful and cause discomfort. The condition is often associated with other skin conditions, such as actinic keratosis and squamous cell carcinoma.

The other answer choices are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Herpes simplex virus-associated pseudolymphoma (choice A) is a rare condition that is characterized by the development of papules, nodules, or tumors on the skin, but it is not associated with the chronic pruritus and skin findings described in the patient's history. Cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasia (choice C) is a condition in which there is an abnormal growth of lymphoid tissue in the skin, leading to the formation of papules, nodules, or tumors. However, this condition is not typically associated with the type of skin findings described in the patient's history. Marginal zone lymphoma (choice D) is a type of cancer that affects the immune system, but it is not associated with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

Therefore, based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is actinic prurigo cheilitis, which is choice B.

D. Apical left ventricular thrombus is the correct answer because it best fits the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.

A. Cardiac metastases from pancreatic adenocarcinoma is an incorrect choice because while it is possible for pancreatic cancer to metastasize to the heart, the patient's imaging findings do not support this diagnosis. The lesions are described as hypodense on CT and partially mobile on echocardiography, which suggests a thrombus rather than a metastatic deposit.

B. Myxoma is an incorrect choice because it is a benign tumor that typically occurs in the left atrium and does not have the same imaging characteristics as the patient's lesions.

C. Angiosarcoma is an incorrect choice because it is a malignant vascular tumor that can occur in the heart, but it is rare and typically presents with symptoms of heart failure or arrhythmias, which are not mentioned in the patient's history.

Therefore, D. Apical left ventricular thrombus is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is C. Coronary artery reimplantation.

The patient in the case has a diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy, which is a condition where the heart muscle becomes weakened and enlarged, leading to a decrease in the heart's ability to pump blood effectively. The patient has had a history of chest pain and dyspnea, which suggests that there may be a blockage in the coronary arteries that supply blood to the heart muscle.

The results of the exercise nuclear stress test show a fixed, severe apical defect, a partially reversible severe anterior wall defect, moderate global hypokinesis, and severe hypokinesis of the distal anterior wall and apex. This suggests that there is a significant blockage in the left anterior descending artery, which is the main coronary artery that supplies blood to the left ventricle.

Given these findings, the best course of action would be to perform coronary artery reimplantation, which involves taking a healthy blood vessel from another part of the body and using it to bypass the blocked coronary artery. This would allow blood to flow more freely to the heart muscle, reducing the patient's symptoms and improving his quality of life.

Now, let's discuss why the other answer choices are incorrect.

A. Percutaneous coronary intervention of the left anterior descending artery: While this procedure may be necessary in some cases, it is not the best option for this patient. The patient has a severe blockage in the left anterior descending artery, which would require a more extensive procedure to bypass the blockage. Percutaneous coronary intervention involves using a small balloon or stent to open up the blockage, but in this case, a more comprehensive bypass surgery would be needed.

B. Coronary artery bypass graft surgery: This procedure involves taking a healthy blood vessel from another part of the body and using it to bypass the blocked coronary artery. While this procedure may be necessary in some cases, it is not the best option for this patient. The patient has a history of dilated cardiomyopathy, which suggests that the heart muscle is already weakened

**Answer**:C. Order cerebrospinal fluid prion disease panel

The patient's presentation of progressive vision loss, gait changes, memory loss, and weight loss, along with the abnormalities in the confrontation visual fields and the normal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) results, suggests a possible diagnosis of a neurodegenerative disorder. Prion diseases, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), are a group of progressive neurodegenerative disorders that can cause visual disturbances, including homonymous hemianopia, and can be diagnosed by analyzing the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for abnormal prion protein.

Therefore, option C, Order cerebrospinal fluid prion disease panel, is the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic workup of this patient. This test can help confirm or rule out a prion disease as the cause of the patient's symptoms.

Option A, Pars plana vitrectomy with vitreous biopsy, is not appropriate at this time, as there is no indication for surgical intervention based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings.

Option B, Prescribe aspirin for secondary stroke prevention, is not relevant to the patient's current symptoms and examination findings, and there is no indication for aspirin therapy.

Option D, Refer to psychiatry for functional vision loss, is not appropriate, as the patient's visual symptoms are not consistent with functional vision loss, and there are other objective neurological findings that suggest a neurodegenerative disorder.

**Answer**:C. Order systemic laboratory workup

The correct answer is C. Order systemic laboratory workup, as it is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's condition.

The patient presents with slowly progressive unilateral blepharoptosis, which is a symptom that could be associated with various underlying conditions, including local eyelid disorders, systemic diseases, or neurological disorders. The presence of a yellow nodular lesion along the tarsal conjunctiva and the positive staining with Congo red suggest the possibility of amyloidosis, a condition characterized by the accumulation of abnormal proteins in various tissues, including the eye.

Therefore, it is important to perform a systemic laboratory workup to rule out any underlying systemic conditions that may be associated with the patient's symptoms and signs. Laboratory tests may include a complete blood count, serum protein electrophoresis, and urinalysis, among others. Additionally, imaging studies such as ultrasonography, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging may be considered to evaluate the extent of the disease and identify any potential secondary causes.

Option A, perform a complete excision, is not the most appropriate next step at this point. While surgical excision may be considered in some cases of blepharoptosis, it is not the first line of management for a patient with a suspected systemic condition. Moreover, the presence of a yellow nodular lesion along the tarsal conjunctiva suggests that the condition may be more than just a local eyelid disorder, making excision less likely to be effective in addressing the underlying cause.

Option B, administer cryotherapy treatment, is also not the most appropriate next step. Cryotherapy is typically used to treat benign lesions such as actinic keratoses, warts, and molluscum contagiosum, but it is not commonly used to treat amyloidosis or other systemic conditions.

Option D, observe, is not a suitable option as it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and signs. Observation may be appropriate in some cases where the condition is benign and not progressing, but in this case, the patient has slowly progressive blepharopt

**Answer**:A. Initiate immunosuppressive therapy

The correct answer is A, "Initiate immunosuppressive therapy," because the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a diagnosis of central serous retinopathy (CSR), which is a type of retinal vascular disease. CSR is often associated with systemic inflammatory conditions, such as sarcoidosis, and initiating immunosuppressive therapy can help to reduce inflammation and prevent further progression of the disease.

Option B, "Monitor for resolution of subretinal fluid," is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a more severe and rapidly progressive disease, and monitoring alone may not be sufficient to prevent further vision loss.

Option C, "Retinal detachment repair with vitrectomy and/or scleral buckle," is incorrect because the patient does not have a retinal detachment, and this procedure would not address the underlying cause of the disease.

Option D, "Surgery to create scleral windows," is also incorrect because it is not a appropriate surgical procedure for CSR and would not address the underlying inflammatory process.

It's important to note that the question is asking for the next step in management, and the answer should be based on the information provided in the question. In this case, the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a diagnosis of CSR, and initiating immunosuppressive therapy is an appropriate next step in management.

**Answer**: D. Pagetoid reticulosis

Pagetoid reticulosis is a rare, benign condition characterized by a chronic, patchy or plaque-like eruption on the skin, often on the extremities. It is also known as pagetoid reticulosis of the skin or PRS.

The clinical presentation of pagetoid reticulosis often mimics other skin conditions, such as psoriasis, eczema, or contact dermatitis, making it challenging to diagnose. However, there are some distinct features that can help differentiate PRS from other conditions.

One of the key features of pagetoid reticulosis is the presence of Pautrier microabscesses, which are small, walled-off collections of lymphocytes that resemble tiny abscesses. These microabscesses are found in the epidermis and are a result of the abnormal migration of lymphocytes into the skin.

In the case presented, the biopsy results showed marked epidermotropism of atypical lymphocytes with irregular nuclear contours and halos, both singly and in small collections (Pautrier microabscesses), which is a classic feature of pagetoid reticulosis. Additionally, the presence of CD3, CD5, and CD8 positive lymphocytes, along with the absence of fungal or yeast elements, further supports the diagnosis of PRS.

Now, let's discuss why the other answer choices are incorrect:

A. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH): LCH is a rare, benign proliferative disorder of Langerhans cells, which are a type of dendritic cell found in the skin. While LCH can present with a similar clinical appearance to PRS, it is characterized by the presence of Langerhans cells with a distinctive "coffin lid" shape and a positive staining for CD1a and CD207. In contrast, PRS does not show a significant number of Langerhans cells.

**Answer**: B. Linear atrophoderma of Moulin

Linear atrophoderma of Moulin is a rare, acquired, progressive, and benign condition characterized by linear, atrophic, hypopigmented or depigmented macules or patches on the trunk and limbs, often following the lines of Blaschko. The condition typically affects one side of the body and is more common in females than males.

In this case, the patient presented with asymptomatic hyperpigmentation on the right side of the trunk, right upper arm, and right leg, strictly following the lines of Blaschko. The patient also reported a slight atrophy of the hyperpigmented skin without any signs of induration. The clinical images show slightly atrophic hyperpigmented macules following the lines of Blaschko on the right side of the trunk and upper arm. The histopathologic images of punch biopsy specimen show normal epidermis and dermis with a slight hyperpigmentation of the basal epidermis layer, and preserved elastic fibers in the reticular dermis.

Given the patient's history of gradual spreading of the hyperpigmentation over the affected areas, the lack of any signs of inflammation or induration, and the characteristic distribution of the lesions following the lines of Blaschko, Linear atrophoderma of Moulin is the most likely diagnosis.

Now, let's discuss why the other choices are incorrect:

A. Epidermal nevus: Epidermal nevi are benign growths of the epidermis that can appear as hyperpigmented macules or patches. However, they are usually present at birth or appear early in childhood, and are not typically progressive or acquired in adulthood. Additionally, epidermal nevi do not typically follow the lines of Blaschko.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain why C. Rosacea-like angiosarcoma is the correct answer and why the other choices are incorrect.

**Answer: C. Rosacea-like angiosarcoma**

C. Rosacea-like angiosarcoma is the correct answer because it matches the clinical and histopathological features described in the case. The patient presented with a 4-month history of new-onset persistent facial eruption, which is consistent with the indolent course of rosacea-like angiosarcoma. The clinical appearance of asymmetric, centrofacial, erythematous-violaceous indurated telangiectatic and ecchymotic plaques over a phymatous background is also consistent with rosacea-like angiosarcoma.

The histopathological findings of ectatic vessels with plump endothelia involving the deep dermis and hypodermis, and the negative immunohistochemistry for Human herpesvirus 8, also support the diagnosis of rosacea-like angiosarcoma. This entity is characterized by the presence of atypical endothelial cells lining the ectatic vessels, which is consistent with the histopathological findings in this case.

**Answer: A. Kaposi sarcoma**

A. Kaposi sarcoma is an incorrect answer because, although it can present with a similar clinical appearance, it typically affects the skin and lymph nodes, and the patient did not have any evidence of lymph node involvement. Additionally, the histopathological findings of Kaposi sarcoma are characterized by the presence of spindle-shaped cells, which were not seen in this case.

**Answer: B. Elder abuse**

B. Elder abuse is an incorrect answer because there is no evidence to suggest that the patient's condition was related to elder abuse.

**Answer**: D. Progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM)

PERM is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the central nervous system, primarily the brain and spinal cord. It is characterized by a combination of symptoms, including rigidity, myoclonus, and progressive weakness or paralysis. The patient's symptoms of worsening spasms in her axial and lower limb muscles, new-onset urinary retention, and hyperhidrosis, as well as the abnormal mental status, cranial nerve examination results, and electromyography (EMG) findings, are consistent with PERM.

In contrast, the other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and examination findings as well:

A. Progressive myoclonic epilepsies (PMEs): PMEs are a group of rare genetic disorders that cause myoclonic seizures, which are sudden, brief muscle jerks or twitches. While myoclonus is a symptom of PERM, it is not the primary feature of PMEs. The patient's symptoms of spasms and rigidity are not typical of PMEs.

B. Faciobrachial dystonic seizures: Faciobrachial dystonic seizures are a type of seizure that affects the muscles of the face, neck, and upper limbs. They are often associated with a specific genetic mutation. The patient's symptoms of spasms and rigidity in her axial and lower limb muscles do not fit the pattern of faciobrachial dystonic seizures.

C. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD): CJD is a rare, degenerative brain disorder caused by an abnormal form of a protein called a prion. It is characterized by rapid neurological deterioration, including memory loss, confusion, and movement disorders. While CJD can cause myoclonus, the patient's symptoms of spasms and rigidity are not typical of CJD.

**Answer**: C. Intravascular natural killer/T-cell lymphoma

The correct answer is C. Intravascular natural killer/T-cell lymphoma because it best matches the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

The patient presented with painful erythematous plaques on her lower legs, which rapidly progressed to both legs, and was accompanied by marked lower-leg edema and intermittent fever that did not respond to antibiotic therapy. These symptoms suggest a systemic inflammatory response, which is consistent with intravascular lymphoma.

The laboratory results also support this diagnosis. The patient's complete blood cell count showed a normal white blood cell count with moderate anemia, which is consistent with intravascular lymphoma. Additionally, the elevated level of serum lactate dehydrogenase and the high viral load of EBV in peripheral blood suggest a viral-associated lymphoproliferative disorder, which is consistent with intravascular natural killer/T-cell lymphoma.

The skin biopsy specimen revealed dilated vessels filled with atypical large lymphoid cells throughout the dermis, which is consistent with the infiltration of malignant cells in the skin.

In contrast, choice A, Erysipelas, is a bacterial infection that typically presents with well-defined, raised borders and is not associated with a high viral load or systemic inflammatory response.

Choice B, Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma, is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that affects the blood vessels, but it typically presents with more widespread involvement of the skin and other organs, and is not typically associated with a high viral load.

Choice D, Cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis, is a condition that involves inflammation of the blood vessels in the skin, but it is not associated with a high viral load or systemic inflammatory response.

**Answer**: D. Perform transesophageal echocardiography

Explanation:
The patient presented with worsening dyspnea, lower extremity edema, and a new heart murmur, which suggests a cardiac condition. The non-ECG-gated computed tomography angiography did not provide a clear diagnosis due to motion artifacts. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed, which showed severe aortic regurgitation (AR) and a mildly dilated aortic root. However, the TTE did not provide a clear view of the aortic valve and root, and did not rule out other potential cardiac causes of the patient's symptoms.

Performing a transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) would provide a higher resolution view of the aortic valve and root, and would be able to diagnose any potential cardiac causes of the patient's symptoms, such as aortic dissection or aortic valve endocarditis. Additionally, TEE can also assess the severity of the aortic regurgitation and the left ventricular function, which would help guide further management.

Therefore, option D is the correct answer.

Option A, ordering blood culture, may be appropriate in the workup of a patient with fever and suspected infection, but it would not provide information about the patient's cardiac condition.

Option B, performing cardiac catheterization, may be necessary in some cases, but it is an invasive procedure that carries risks and would not be the next step in the management of this patient.

Option C, repeating non-ECG-gated computed tomography angiography, may be appropriate if the initial study was not diagnostic, but it would not provide the same level of detail as TEE and may not be able to diagnose all potential cardiac causes of the patient's symptoms.

**Answer**:D. Initiate laboratory testing for immunoglobulins

The patient's symptoms and clinical findings suggest a possible diagnosis of amiodarone-induced corneal verticillata and crystals. Although the patient has stopped taking amiodarone for 10 months, it is still possible that the medication is causing the corneal deposits.

Option A is incorrect because, although it is true that the patient is no longer taking amiodarone, it does not address the underlying cause of the corneal verticillata and crystals.

Option B is incorrect because genetic testing is not typically indicated in cases of amiodarone-induced corneal verticillata and crystals.

Option C is incorrect because corneal scraping and culture are not necessary to diagnose amiodarone-induced corneal verticillata and crystals.

Option D is correct because laboratory testing for immunoglobulins can help support the diagnosis of amiodarone-induced corneal verticillata and crystals. Immunoglobulins are antibodies that can accumulate in the cornea and contribute to the formation of crystals. Laboratory testing can help determine if the patient's immunoglobulin levels are elevated, which can support the diagnosis. Additionally, laboratory testing can help rule out other potential causes of corneal verticillata and crystals, such as systemic autoimmune diseases.

**Answer**:C. Immediate optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF)

The correct answer is C. Immediate optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF) for the following reasons:

A. Begin intravenous anticoagulation:
Anticoagulation therapy may be beneficial in preventing further vision loss in patients with IIH and suspected DVST. However, in this case, the patient already has severe bilateral vision loss, and starting anticoagulation therapy may not reverse the existing damage. Moreover, anticoagulation therapy alone may not address the underlying cause of IIH and DVST. Therefore, this option is not the most appropriate choice.

B. Serial lumbar punctures:
Serial lumbar punctures may be considered as a temporary measure to alleviate symptoms and reduce opening pressure in the absence of a definitive treatment plan. However, this approach has several limitations. Firstly, it may not be effective in managing severe papilledema and vision loss. Secondly, it may not address the underlying cause of IIH and DVST. Lastly, serial lumbar punctures may not be feasible in patients with severe postural headaches and nausea, as they may not be able to tolerate the procedure. Therefore, this option is not the most appropriate choice.

D. Consult neurosurgery for consideration of drain or shunt placement:
While neurosurgical intervention may be necessary in some cases of IIH and DVST, it is not the most appropriate choice in this scenario. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest severe bilateral vision loss, which may not be reversible with surgical intervention alone. Moreover, the risk of surgical complications may outweigh the potential benefits in this case. Therefore, this option is not the most appropriate choice.

C. Immediate optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF):
ONSF is a surgical procedure that has been shown to improve vision in patients with IIH and severe papilledema. The procedure involves creating a window in the optic nerve sheath to relieve pressure on the optic nerve. In this case, the patient's severe bilateral vision loss and severe papilledema suggest that ONS

**Answer**: D. Perform biopsy of lesion

The correct answer is D. Perform biopsy of lesion because it is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's condition.

The patient presents with a large lesion in the right greater wing of the sphenoid bone, which is extending towards the orbital apex and causing proptosis, eyelid edema, and erythema. The lesion also involves the right temporal lobe of the brain, suggesting a possible intracranial extension.

Given the patient's symptoms and the imaging findings, it is important to determine the nature of the lesion. A biopsy would allow for a tissue diagnosis, which would guide further management and treatment.

Option A, ordering a positron emission tomographic (PET) scan, may be considered, but it is not the most appropriate next step. A PET scan would provide information on the metabolic activity of the lesion, but it would not provide a tissue diagnosis.

Option B, starting treatment with intravenous antibiotics, is not appropriate because there is no evidence of an infectious process. The patient has already been treated with oral antibiotics without improvement, and the imaging findings do not suggest an infection.

Option C, starting treatment with intravenous corticosteroids, may be considered, but it is not the most appropriate next step. Corticosteroids may be used to reduce inflammation, but they would not provide a tissue diagnosis or treat the underlying cause of the lesion.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a biopsy of the lesion to determine its nature and guide further management.

**Answer**: C. Herpes vegetans

The patient's symptoms and test results indicate that the most likely diagnosis is Herpes vegetans, also known as herpes simplex virus (HSV) vegetation.

The patient's history of genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) and the presence of a painful, ulcerative lesion on the perianal skin are consistent with HSV infection. The biopsy results also support this diagnosis, as they show a dense inflammatory infiltrate and focal multinucleated keratinocytes with gray-blue cytoplasm, which are characteristic features of HSV infection.

Squamous cell carcinoma (choice A) is unlikely because the patient's age and medical history do not suggest a high risk for this diagnosis, and the biopsy results do not show the characteristic features of squamous cell carcinoma.

CD30-positive primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (choice B) is also unlikely because the patient's age and medical history do not suggest a high risk for this diagnosis, and the biopsy results do not show the characteristic features of CD30-positive primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma.

Giant condyloma acuminatum (Buschke-Löwenstein tumor) (choice D) is unlikely because the patient's age and medical history do not suggest a high risk for this diagnosis, and the biopsy results do not show the characteristic features of giant condyloma acuminatum.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, medical history, and biopsy results, the most likely diagnosis is Herpes vegetans.

**Answer**:C. Primary cutaneous aggressive epidermotropic cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell lymphoma

The correct answer is C, Primary cutaneous aggressive epidermotropic cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell lymphoma, because it best matches the patient's symptoms and laboratory results described in the case.

A. CD8+ mycosis fungoides is an incorrect choice because although there is an epidermotropic infiltrate of CD8+ lymphocytes, the histopathological features described, such as pagetoid reticulosis-like pattern and absence of Pautrier microabscesses, are not typical of mycosis fungoides. Additionally, the patient's age and lack of clinically appreciable lymphadenopathy do not fit the usual presentation of mycosis fungoides.

B. Lymphomatoid papulosis, type D is an incorrect choice because the patient's clinical presentation and histopathological features do not match the characteristics of lymphomatoid papulosis. Lymphomatoid papulosis typically presents with papules or nodules that resolve within weeks to months, and there is no mention of spontaneous resolution of the patient's lesions. Moreover, the histopathological features described, such as epidermotropic infiltrate of CD8+ lymphocytes, are not typical of lymphomatoid papulosis.

D. Natural killer/T-cell lymphoma is an incorrect choice because the patient's histopathological features and immunophenotype do not match the characteristics of natural killer/T-cell lymphoma. Natural killer/T-cell lymphoma typically presents with a CD56+ and CD16+ phenotype, whereas the patient's T cells were negative for CD56 and positive for CD8. Additionally, the patient's age and lack of extranodal involvement do not fit the usual presentation of natural killer/T-cell lymphoma.

**Answer**:B. Angiosarcoma

The correct answer is B. Angiosarcoma because it best matches the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

Angiosarcoma is a rare, malignant tumor that arises from the endothelial cells lining blood vessels. It often presents as a rapidly growing, painful, and tender mass, which is consistent with the patient's description of an enlarging, tender, pruritic patch on the forehead. The presence of central inflammatory papules is also consistent with Angiosarcoma, as it often presents with a papillary or nodular surface.

The histopathological results revealed dissecting vascular channels and spindle cells, which are characteristic features of Angiosarcoma. The immunohistochemical staining results showed diffuse expression of FLI-1 and ERG in the vascular and spindle cell components, which supports the diagnosis of Angiosarcoma. FLI-1 is a transcription factor that is commonly expressed in endothelial cells and is often used as a marker for Angiosarcoma. ERG is a transcription factor that is also commonly expressed in endothelial cells and is often used as a marker for Angiosarcoma.

In contrast, Cutaneous B-cell lymphoma (choice A) typically presents as a painless, slowly growing nodule or plaque on the skin, and the histopathological features are different from Angiosarcoma. Metastatic carcinoma (choice C) can have a variety of skin manifestations, but the presence of central inflammatory papules and the histopathological features of dissecting vascular channels and spindle cells are not typical of metastatic carcinoma. Merkel cell carcinoma (choice D) is a rare, aggressive skin cancer that typically presents as a painless, firm nodule on the skin, and the histopathological features are different from Angiosarcoma.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and histopathological features, the most likely diagnosis is Angiosarcoma.

**Answer**:C. Consult cardiothoracic surgery for controlled operative thrombectomy

Explanation:

A. Start intravenous unfractionated heparin: This choice is incorrect because while heparin is an appropriate medication for treating deep vein thrombosis (DVT), it may not be effective in dissolving large pulmonary emboli. Additionally, heparin may increase the risk of bleeding in patients with pulmonary embolism, and its use in this case may not be appropriate given the patient's recent syncopal event.

B. Consult interventional radiology for catheter-directed thrombolysis: This choice is incorrect because catheter-directed thrombolysis may not be the best approach for treating large pulmonary emboli. While it may be effective in some cases, it may not be able to effectively dissolve larger clots, and it may also carry a risk of bleeding complications.

D. Give systemic thrombolysis and admit to the intensive care unit: This choice is incorrect because systemic thrombolysis may not be the best approach for treating pulmonary embolism, especially in patients with a recent syncopal event. While it may be effective in dissolving clots, it may also increase the risk of bleeding complications, which could be dangerous for the patient. Admitting the patient to the intensive care unit may also not be necessary, as the patient's vital signs are stable and there are no signs of severe respiratory or cardiac distress.

C. Consult cardiothoracic surgery for controlled operative thrombectomy: This choice is correct because controlled operative thrombectomy is a surgical procedure that can effectively remove large pulmonary emboli. It may be the best approach for treating patients with large pulmonary emboli who are hemodynamically stable, as it allows for immediate removal of the clot and may reduce the risk of bleeding complications compared to systemic thrombolysis. In this case, the patient's stable vital signs and absence of severe respiratory or cardiac distress suggest that she may be a good candidate for this procedure. Consulting cardiothoracic surg

The correct answer is B: Acromegaly.

Acromegaly is a rare hormonal disorder that occurs when the pituitary gland produces too much growth hormone (GH) over a long period of time. This excess GH can cause a variety of symptoms, including enlargement of the hands, feet, and tongue, as well as changes in the bones and facial features.

In this case, the patient's symptoms of a change in bite, growth in his tongue and feet, and intermittent swelling with numbness in his hands are all consistent with acromegaly. The patient's oropharyngeal examination findings, including a Mallampati 4 oropharynx score, 3-plus tonsils, and macroglossia without scalloping of the tongue, are also consistent with acromegaly.

The other answer choices are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and examination findings. Allergic rhinitis (choice A) is an allergic reaction that affects the nasal passages and is not associated with the symptoms described in the case. Lymphoma (choice C) is a type of cancer that affects the immune system and is not associated with the patient's symptoms or examination findings. Normal anatomic variant (choice D) is not a diagnosis, but rather a description of a normal variation in the size and shape of the tonsils.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: Acromegaly.

D. Castleman disease is the correct answer because it is a benign lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by the proliferation of lymphoid tissue, often with a dominant follicle surrounded by a mantle of small lymphocytes, as seen in the low-power histology image provided (Figure 1B). The patient's history of a persistent neck mass, elevated white blood cell count, and C-reactive protein level, as well as the negative results of various infectious disease tests, support this diagnosis.

In contrast, Rosai-Dorfman disease (choice A) is a rare benign histiocytic disorder characterized by the proliferation of histiocytes, usually with emperipolesis (phagocytosis of lymphocytes by histiocytes). While it can present with lymphadenopathy, the histopathology is distinct from Castleman disease.

Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease (choice B) is a rare autoimmune lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by the proliferation of lymphocytes and histiocytes, with a characteristic "coffin lid" or "bird's wing" appearance on histological examination. While it can present with lymphadenopathy and elevated inflammatory markers, the histopathology and clinical features are distinct from Castleman disease.

Dianzani autoimmune lymphoproliferative disease (choice C) is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by the proliferation of lymphocytes and plasma cells, with a characteristic "salt and pepper" appearance on histological examination. While it can present with lymphadenopathy and elevated inflammatory markers, the histopathology and clinical features are distinct from Castleman disease.

Therefore, D. Castleman disease is the most appropriate answer.

**Answer**: D. Elect observation

Explanation:

A. Initiate an oral prednisone course:

While it's true that corticosteroids, such as prednisone, can be used to treat certain eye conditions, such as uveitis, they are not the appropriate choice for this patient's condition. The patient's symptoms of sudden onset of multiple green spots in both eyes, with no associated eye pain or photophobia, and normal anterior segment examination, suggest a diagnosis of acute zonal occult outer retinopathy (AZOOR). AZOOR is a rare, idiopathic condition that is often associated with certain medications, including cobimetinib, which the patient had started taking 2 weeks prior to presentation.

Initiating oral prednisone therapy would not address the underlying cause of the condition, and may even mask the symptoms, making it more difficult to diagnose and monitor the progression of the disease.

B. Order a positron emission tomography scan:

While a positron emission tomography (PET) scan may be useful in evaluating the patient's breast cancer, it would not provide any information about the patient's ocular symptoms. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a diagnosis of AZOOR, which is an ocular condition that does not require a PET scan for diagnosis or monitoring.

C. Discontinue breast cancer treatment:

Discontinuing the patient's breast cancer treatment would not address the underlying cause of the AZOOR. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a diagnosis of AZOOR, which is an ocular condition that is associated with certain medications, including cobimetinib. Discontinuing the breast cancer treatment would not resolve the patient's ocular symptoms, and may even compromise the patient's cancer treatment.

D. Elect observation:

Given the patient's sudden onset of multiple green spots in both eyes, with no associated eye pain or photophobia, and normal anterior segment examination, the most appropriate course of action would be to elect observation. This would allow the patient's condition to be monitored closely, with regular follow-up appointments

**Answer**:C. Inquire about bright light exposures

The correct answer is C. Inquire about bright light exposures, as it is the most appropriate next step in the evaluation of this patient's symptoms.

The patient's symptoms of bilateral reduced central visual acuity, characterized as atraumatic, painless, constant, symmetric, and nonprogressive, along with the physical examination findings of a bilateral maculopathy with focal areas of gray-brown discoloration and yellow-orange pigmentation, suggest a possible diagnosis of retinal toxicity. The patient's history of recent hospitalization for a suspected overdose with multiple medications, including atomoxetine, quetiapine, melatonin, fluoxetine, bupropion, and clonazepam, increases the likelihood of drug-induced retinal toxicity.

Inquire about bright light exposures is the most appropriate next step because it could help identify a potential cause of the retinal toxicity. Bright light exposure can cause damage to the retina, particularly in cases of drug-induced retinal toxicity. By asking about the patient's exposure to bright lights, the clinician can gather information that may help establish the underlying cause of the retinal damage.

Stopping all psychiatric medications (option A) may be a necessary step in managing the patient's symptoms, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this point in the evaluation. Obtaining an electroretinogram (option B) may also be useful in evaluating the patient's retinal function, but it is not the most pressing concern at this stage. Prescribing oral steroids (option D) is not a appropriate next step, as steroids are not typically used to treat retinal toxicity.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Inquire about bright light exposures.

**Answer**: B. Perform transcutaneous retrobulbar injection of an antifungal agent

The patient presented with acute-onset visual acuity loss in the right eye, along with periorbital pain, and was found to have inflammatory changes in the right medial orbital wall and orbital apex on noncontrast imaging. These findings are concerning for an orbital infection, which can be a serious and sight-threatening condition.

The patient's history of advanced diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease increases the likelihood of an infectious etiology, and the presence of fungal hyphal elements on sinus biopsy supports this diagnosis.

Given the patient's clinical presentation and imaging findings, urgent treatment is warranted to prevent further visual loss and potential life-threatening complications.

Option A, awaiting improvement in renal status and performing contrast-enhanced imaging, may not be the most appropriate choice at this time. While it is important to consider the patient's overall health and potential risks of contrast-enhanced imaging, the acute nature of the patient's symptoms and the presence of inflammatory changes on noncontrast imaging suggest that prompt intervention is needed.

Option C, perform orbital debridement, may be a necessary step in managing the patient's condition, but it is not the most appropriate initial step. Debridement is a surgical procedure that involves removing dead or damaged tissue, and it may not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

Option D, perform orbital exenteration, is a more invasive procedure that involves removing the entire orbit, and it is not indicated in this case given the patient's clinical presentation and imaging findings.

Therefore, option B, perform transcutaneous retrobulbar injection of an antifungal agent, is the most appropriate next step in managing the patient's condition. This treatment approach can help address the likely infectious etiology of the patient's symptoms, and it can be performed relatively quickly and easily, without the need for more invasive surgical intervention.

**Answer**: C. Ductal adenocarcinoma of the breast

The patient's symptoms and test results point to ductal adenocarcinoma of the breast as the most likely diagnosis. The presence of a translucent nodule on the right nipple, along with a family history of breast cancer in the patient's mother and sister, are both indicative of this condition. Additionally, the dermoscopic examination revealed a translucent lesion with arborizing vessels and erosion, which is consistent with ductal adenocarcinoma of the breast.

The other options are less likely diagnoses for the following reasons:

A. Basal cell carcinoma: This type of skin cancer typically appears as a flesh-colored or pink nodule, rather than a translucent one. It is also less likely to have a family history of breast cancer.

B. Amelanotic melanoma: This type of skin cancer is characterized by a lack of pigmentation, but it typically appears as a flat or slightly raised discolored patch, rather than a translucent nodule. It is also less likely to have a family history of breast cancer.

D. Erosive adenomatosis of the nipple: This condition is characterized by erosive changes on the nipple, but it is typically associated with a history of breastfeeding, which is not mentioned in the patient's history.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and test results, ductal adenocarcinoma of the breast is the most likely diagnosis.

**Answer**: B. Primary umbilical endometriosis

The correct answer is B. Primary umbilical endometriosis. This is because the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and histopathologic features are consistent with this diagnosis.

The patient's 1-year history of an umbilical nodule, occasional pain, and intermittent bleeding from the site are consistent with the symptoms of primary umbilical endometriosis. This condition is characterized by the growth of endometrial tissue outside the uterus, often in the form of a nodule or mass, and can cause pain and bleeding.

The physical examination findings of a discrete, reddish-brown, noncompressible, smooth nodule within the umbilicus are also consistent with primary umbilical endometriosis. The absence of any change in size with the Valsalva maneuver suggests that the nodule is not caused by a hernia or other types of benign tumors.

The histopathologic examination findings of stromal tissue and glandular epithelium within the dermis, with spindle-cell stroma, hemorrhage, and hemosiderin-laden macrophages, are consistent with primary umbilical endometriosis. The presence of glandular epithelium composed of basophilic cuboidal cells and showing decapitation secretion further supports this diagnosis.

Computed tomography scan of the abdomen showed a well-circumscribed nodule within the umbilicus without intrabdominal extension or herniation, which is consistent with primary umbilical endometriosis.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Metastatic adenocarcinoma: This diagnosis is unlikely given the patient's age and the absence of any other symptoms or signs of malignancy. The histopathologic features of the nodule are also not consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma.

C. Urachal duct cyst: This diagnosis is unlikely given the absence of any other symptoms or signs of urachal duct cyst, such as abdominal pain, fever, or

**Answer**:C. Pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of progressive dyspnea, weight gain, and bilateral ground-glass opacities on chest CT, along with the presence of para-aortic and inguinal lymphadenopathies, are consistent with pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy (PTTM). PTTM is a rare condition caused by tumor emboli lodging in the small pulmonary arteries, leading to occlusion and inflammation. The patient's history of lung adenocarcinoma and the presence of extramammary Paget disease on autopsy support this diagnosis.

The other choices do not fit the patient's symptoms and findings:

A. Left ventricular systolic dysfunction: The patient's echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular function, which rules out this diagnosis.

B. Sarcoidosis: Sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect various organs, including the lungs. However, the patient's symptoms and findings are not consistent with sarcoidosis. The presence of bilateral ground-glass opacities and consolidative lesions on chest CT, as well as the absence of any other signs of sarcoidosis, make this diagnosis unlikely.

D. Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension: While the patient's symptoms of dyspnea and weight gain are consistent with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), the absence of any other signs of CTEPH, such as chronic thromboembolic lesions, makes this diagnosis less likely. Additionally, the patient's history of lung adenocarcinoma and the presence of extramammary Paget disease on autopsy support the diagnosis of PTTM over CTEPH.

**Answer**: B. Pericardiocentesis with pericardial drain placement

The correct answer is B, Pericardiocentesis with pericardial drain placement, because it is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's pericardial effusion.

A. Urgent referral for cardiovascular surgery is not the most appropriate next step, as the patient's condition is not severe enough to require immediate surgical intervention. While surgery may be necessary in the future, it is not the most urgent step in the patient's management.

C. Urgent vascular surgery referral for IVC stent removal is also not the most appropriate next step. While the IVC stent may need to be removed in the future, it is not the most pressing concern in the patient's management at this time. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest that the pericardial effusion is the more urgent issue that needs to be addressed.

D. Initiation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and colchicine and observation is not the most appropriate next step, as these medications are not effective in managing pericardial effusions. While they may be used in the long-term management of the patient's condition, they are not the most urgent intervention needed at this time.

Pericardiocentesis with pericardial drain placement, on the other hand, is a minimally invasive procedure that can quickly and effectively drain the pericardial effusion, relieving the patient's symptoms and improving their cardiac function. This procedure can be performed under local anesthesia and has a low risk of complications, making it the most appropriate next step in the patient's management.

**Answer**: C. IgG4-related disease

The patient's symptoms of progressive odynophagia, hoarseness, and dysphagia of solids, liquids, and secretions, as well as the physical examination findings of erythema and swelling to the right arytenoid, are consistent with a diagnosis of IgG4-related disease. This is a rare autoimmune disorder that can affect various organs, including the larynx. The patient's history of reactive airway disease and eczema also supports this diagnosis, as these conditions are commonly associated with IgG4-related disease.

The patient's negative respiratory symptoms and unremarkable complete head and neck physical examination make option A, laryngeal tuberculosis, less likely. Tuberculosis typically presents with respiratory symptoms such as cough, fever, and weight loss, and would likely have been detected on the physical examination.

Option B, systemic lupus erythematosus, is also less likely given the patient's history and physical examination findings. While lupus can affect the larynx, it typically presents with a wider range of symptoms, including joint pain, rash, and serositis. The patient's lack of respiratory symptoms and negative complete head and neck physical examination also make lupus less likely.

Option D, Churg-Strauss syndrome, is a rare condition that can affect the larynx, but it typically presents with a history of asthma and eosinophilic infiltration of various organs. The patient's history of reactive airway disease and eczema, as well as the negative results of the biopsy and culture, make Churg-Strauss syndrome less likely.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, history, and physical examination findings, as well as the results of the diagnostic tests, the most likely diagnosis is IgG4-related disease.

**Answer**:A. Glomus tumor

The patient's symptoms, such as right nasal pain, radiating facial pain, nasal tenderness, and worsening pain with exposure to cold temperatures, are consistent with a glomus tumor. Glomus tumors are rare, benign tumors that originate from the glomus cells, which are specialized cells located in the nasal septum and turbinate bones. They are characterized by their ability to regulate the temperature and humidity of the air we breathe.

The patient's physical examination findings, including a submucosal, round, firm, tender lesion located on the right anterior nasal septum, are also consistent with a glomus tumor. The lesion's size, shape, and location, as well as its attachment to the underlying perichondrium, are all typical features of a glomus tumor.

The other answer choices are less likely possibilities based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

B. Inverted papilloma: Inverted papillomas are benign growths that occur in the nasal cavity and are typically associated with chronic rhinosinusitis. They are more common in older adults and are characterized by a wart-like appearance. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest an inverted papilloma.

C. Hemangiopericytoma: Hemangiopericytomas are rare, benign tumors that originate from the blood vessels. They are typically located in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest a hemangiopericytoma.

D. Paraganglioma: Paragangliomas are rare, benign tumors that originate from the paraganglia, which are clusters of cells located near the sympathetic nerve fibers. They are typically located in the head and neck region. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest a paraganglioma.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is a glomus tumor.

**Answer**: C. Rhinoscleroma

Rhinoscleroma is a rare, chronic granulomatous disease that affects the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. It is caused by the bacterium Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis and is most commonly seen in tropical and subtropical regions. The patient's symptoms of nasal congestion, dysphonia, and subglottic stenosis, as well as the physical examination findings of bilateral nasal polyps and laryngeal masses, are consistent with rhinoscleroma. The patient's history of emigrating from Guatemala, where rhinoscleroma is endemic, also supports this diagnosis.

The patient's age and lack of other symptoms, such as fever, dysphagia, or odynophagia, also fit with the typical presentation of rhinoscleroma. The disease tends to affect middle-aged adults and often presents with nasal symptoms, such as nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and epistaxis, as well as laryngeal symptoms, such as dysphonia and stridor.

The radiologic findings, including the subglottic stenosis and laryngeal masses, are also consistent with rhinoscleroma. The disease can cause stenosis of the subglottic region and can also result in the formation of polyps or masses in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses.

The biopsy results showing vacuolated macrophages with bacilli and eosinophilic inclusions within plasma cells are also consistent with rhinoscleroma. The bacilli are thought to be a result of the chronic infection with K. rhinoscleromatis and are a hallmark of the disease.

In summary, the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, radiologic results, and biopsy results are all consistent with a diagnosis of rhinoscleroma.

**Answer**:C. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma

The patient's symptoms, which include a palatal swelling of unknown duration that is not painful or uncomfortable, and the absence of any other symptoms such as fever, weight loss, or night sweats, are consistent with a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The patient's age, in her 60s, is also consistent with the typical age range for DLBCL.

The clinical appearance of the lesion, which is described as a focally ulcerated, fluctuant 2.5 × 2 × 1-cm pink-red submucosal swelling in the right palatal mucosa, is also consistent with DLBCL. The fact that the lesion involves almost the entire right side of the hard palatal mucosa and soft palate and terminates at the palatal midline suggests that it is a diffuse process, which is consistent with the name of the disease.

The histopathological findings, which show sheets of large lymphocytes with a moderate amount of cytoplasm and round to oval nuclei containing vesicular chromatin and 2 to 3 small nucleoli, are also consistent with DLBCL. The fact that the lesional cells stained positively with CD20, CD45, CD79, CD21, BCL6, and BCL2 antibodies supports the diagnosis of DLBCL.

In contrast, pleomorphic adenoma (choice A) is a benign salivary gland tumor that typically affects the parotid gland, and is rare in the palate. Angioleiomyoma (choice B) is a rare benign tumor of the soft tissues that is not typically found in the palate. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (choice D) is a malignant tumor that arises in the salivary glands, but is unlikely to present with a diffuse process involving the entire right side of the hard palatal mucosa and soft palate.

**Answer**: D. Pneumoparotid

The correct answer is D. Pneumoparotid because it matches the patient's symptoms and the findings on the noncontrasted computed tomographic (CT) scan of the neck and chest.

Pneumoparotid refers to the presence of air in the parotid gland, which is a salivary gland located in the neck. In this case, the patient had a habit of forcing air into his neck by puffing out his cheeks and then decompressing it back into his oral cavity by pushing behind his ear. This habit likely caused the air to enter the parotid gland, leading to pneumoparotid.

The patient's symptoms of worsening facial swelling, neck pain, dysphagia, and odynophagia are consistent with pneumoparotid. The tender, fluctuant pocket of the left neck near the angle of the mandible without significant crepitus, as well as the inferior dissection of subcutaneous emphysema resulting in pneumomediastinum, are also consistent with pneumoparotid.

The other answer choices do not match the patient's symptoms or the findings on the CT scan:

A. Esophageal perforation: This is a tear or hole in the esophagus that can cause symptoms such as chest pain, fever, and difficulty swallowing. While the patient did have odynophagia (painful swallowing), there is no evidence of a tear or hole in the esophagus.

B. Necrotizing fasciitis: This is a serious bacterial infection that can cause damage to the skin and underlying tissues. While the patient did have neck pain and swelling, there is no evidence of a bacterial infection or damage to the skin and underlying tissues.

B. Starting treatment with topical antibiotics would not be appropriate because there is no evidence of infection. The patient's history of disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infection and previous treatment with rifabutin, ethambutol hydrochloride, and clarithromycin does not indicate a current infection.

C. Planning a descemetorhexis and posterior cornea biopsy would not be appropriate because it is not necessary to remove the deposits. The patient's symptoms are not affecting her vision, and the deposits are not causing any discomfort. Additionally, the risks associated with the procedure outweigh the potential benefits.

D. Reassure the patient and observe is the correct answer because the patient's symptoms are not severe, and the deposits are not affecting her vision. The patient should be monitored regularly to ensure that the deposits do not grow or cause any discomfort. If the patient's symptoms change or the deposits become problematic, treatment can be reevaluated at that time.

**Answer**: B. Blood testing for infectious and inflammatory agents

The patient's symptoms of blurred vision, pain in the left eye, and deep throbbing in the back of the left eye, along with the physical examination findings of visual acuity of 20/20 OD and counting fingers at 1 ft OS, visual field constriction, and a relative afferent pupillary defect in the left eye, suggest a possible diagnosis of anterior optic neuropathy. The patient's history of recurrent episodes of flulike symptoms and blurry vision, with full recovery between episodes, increases the likelihood of an inflammatory or infectious etiology.

Therefore, blood testing for infectious and inflammatory agents is the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation. This would help to identify any underlying conditions that may be causing the optic neuropathy, such as a viral or bacterial infection, autoimmune disorder, or inflammatory condition.

In contrast, magnetic resonance angiography of the neck (choice A) may be useful in evaluating the blood vessels of the neck, but it is not the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation, as it is unlikely to provide information about the underlying cause of the optic neuropathy.

Treatment with oral prednisone (choice C) may be considered if the patient's symptoms are thought to be related to an inflammatory or autoimmune disorder, but it is premature to initiate treatment without first identifying the underlying cause of the optic neuropathy.

Observation (choice D) is not a suitable option, as the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a potentially serious underlying condition that requires further evaluation and management.

In summary, blood testing for infectious and inflammatory agents is the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation, as it has the potential to identify the underlying cause of the optic neuropathy and guide further management.

**Answer**:C. Obtain a family medical history and pursue genetic testing

The correct answer is C. Obtain a family medical history and pursue genetic testing. The patient's symptoms of retinal pigment abnormalities and concern for cancer-associated retinopathy warrant further investigation. The patient's history of thyroid cancer and radiation therapy, as well as the report of trace nuclear sclerosis, suggests that the patient may have a genetic predisposition to certain eye disorders. Additionally, the patient's difficulty with night driving owing to glare and mild cone system dysfunction on full-field electroretinography (ERG) testing suggest that there may be a retinal degeneration component to her symptoms.

Option A, initiating AREDS nutritional supplement treatment for age-related macular degeneration, may be appropriate, but it is not the most appropriate next step. While the patient's age and symptoms are consistent with age-related macular degeneration, the patient's history of thyroid cancer and radiation therapy, as well as the retinal pigment abnormalities and mild cone system dysfunction, suggest that the patient's condition may be more complex than simple age-related macular degeneration.

Option B, monitoring retinal pigment abnormalities without further workup, is not appropriate. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest that further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause of her retinal pigment abnormalities and to rule out any potentially treatable conditions.

Option D, referring for intensification of oral therapy for type 2 diabetes, may be appropriate, but it is not the most appropriate next step. While the patient's diabetes may be a contributing factor to her retinal pigment abnormalities, the patient's history of thyroid cancer and radiation therapy, as well as the retinal pigment abnormalities and mild cone system dysfunction, suggest that the patient's condition may be more complex than simply requiring intensification of oral therapy for diabetes.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to obtain a family medical history and pursue genetic testing to help determine the underlying cause of the patient's retinal

**Answer**: A. Perform biopsy of the iris lesion

The correct answer is A, Perform biopsy of the iris lesion, because it is the most appropriate step to diagnose the cause of the patient's symptoms. The patient has recurrent redness and photophobia in one eye, which suggests an inflammatory or infectious condition. The slitlamp examination reveals a vascularized iris infiltrate, which is consistent with ocular juvenile xanthogranuloma (OJXG).

A biopsy of the iris lesion would allow for a definitive diagnosis of OJXG and would guide further management. The biopsy can be performed using a technique called fine-needle aspiration biopsy, which involves using a thin needle to collect a sample of cells from the iris lesion. The sample can then be sent for histopathological analysis and PCR testing to confirm the diagnosis.

The other answer choices are not as appropriate for the following reasons:

B. Administer subtenon corticosteroid injection: This choice may provide temporary relief of symptoms, but it would not provide a definitive diagnosis or address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

C. Perform anterior chamber paracentesis for viral polymerase chain reaction: While this test may be useful in diagnosing certain viral infections, it is not specific to OJXG and may not provide a definitive diagnosis.

D. Screen for antinuclear antibody: This choice is not relevant to the patient's symptoms or suspected diagnosis of OJXG.

Therefore, the best answer is A, Perform biopsy of the iris lesion, as it would provide a definitive diagnosis and guide further management.

**Answer**: C. Prescribe omeprazole (40 mg twice daily)

The correct answer is C. Prescribe omeprazole (40 mg twice daily) because the patient's symptoms of intermittent dysphagia, primarily to solids, especially meats, localized retrosternally, are consistent with esophageal dysmotility. The patient's history of taking ranitidine (150 mg twice daily) without improvement suggests that the dysphagia is not caused by gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which ranitidine is used to treat.

Esophageal dysmotility can be caused by a variety of factors, including neurological disorders, muscular disorders, and certain medications. In this case, the patient's history and physical examination do not suggest any underlying neurological or muscular disorders. Therefore, it is likely that the dysphagia is caused by a medication side effect or a functional disorder.

Omeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, is commonly used to treat GERD and other gastrointestinal disorders. However, it has also been shown to improve symptoms of esophageal dysmotility in some patients. A study published in the Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology found that omeprazole therapy improved esophageal motility and symptoms in patients with esophageal dysmotility. Therefore, prescribing omeprazole (40 mg twice daily) is a reasonable next step in managing this patient's dysphagia.

The other answer choices are not as appropriate for several reasons:

A. Order barium esophagram: While a barium esophagram can provide useful information about the esophageal anatomy and identify any structural abnormalities, it is not the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's dysphagia. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a functional disorder rather than a structural abnormality.

**Answer**: C. Linear IgA dermatosis

Linear IgA dermatosis, also known as linear IgA bullous dermatosis, is a rare autoimmune skin condition characterized by the formation of blisters and bullae on the skin. The condition is caused by the deposition of IgA antibodies along the basement membrane zone of the skin, leading to a reaction that damages the skin and forms blisters.

In the case described, the patient had a history of coronary artery bypass surgery and was taking medications such as furosemide and amiloride. These medications are known to cause a hypersensitivity reaction, which can lead to the development of linear IgA dermatosis. The patient's symptoms, such as the appearance of a well-demarcated, circular erythematous plaque with raised erythematous margins and studded with numerous blisters and pustules, are consistent with linear IgA dermatosis.

The patient's age and the fact that the lesion showed a marked tendency for centrifugal extension over the chest area also support the diagnosis of linear IgA dermatosis. The negative results of routine laboratory studies, Mantoux test, chest radiography, and chest computed tomography of the area further support the diagnosis, as linear IgA dermatosis is not typically associated with any specific laboratory abnormalities.

The other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms. Annular pustular psoriasis is a condition that causes pustules to form on the skin, but it is not typically associated with a history of coronary artery bypass surgery or the use of medications such as furosemide and amiloride. Bullous tinea is a fungal infection that can cause blisters and bullae on the skin, but it is typically associated with a history of exposure to fungal spores and does not typically affect the chest area. Acute localized exanthematous pustulosis is a condition that causes pustules to form on the skin, but it is typically associated with a bacterial infection and does not have the same clinical appearance as linear IgA dermatosis

**Answer**: B. Spindle cell lipoma

The patient's symptoms, such as progressive skin thickening and subcutaneous enlargement of the right side of her nose and right cheek, are consistent with spindle cell lipoma. The clinical examination findings of slightly hyperplastic soft tissue with dilated patulous follicles involving the right medial malar cheek and right nasal ala, as well as deviation of the nasal tip, also support this diagnosis.

The histopathological findings of interstitial proliferation of spindle cells within mature adipocytes that extends between bundles of skeletal muscle, as well as mature adipocytes that are separated by a proliferation of spindle cells associated with fragments of thickened collagen, are also consistent with spindle cell lipoma.

Spindle cell lipoma is a rare benign tumor that typically affects the subcutaneous tissue of the head and neck, and it is characterized by a proliferation of spindle-shaped cells that infiltrate the fat lobules. It is often misdiagnosed as a fibroma or a lipoma, but it can be distinguished from these entities by the presence of spindle cells and the absence of mature adipocytes.

The other answer choices are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and histopathological findings. Lupus panniculitis (subcutaneous lupus erythematosus) is a condition that causes inflammation of the subcutaneous tissue and is associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. It is characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of the subcutaneous tissue, but it does not have the same histopathological features as spindle cell lipoma.

Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is a rare malignant tumor that affects the skin and subcutaneous tissue. It is characterized by a proliferation of fibroblastic cells that infiltrate the dermis and subcutaneous tissue, but it does not have the same histopathological features as spindle cell lipoma.

**Answer**:C. Bullous mastocytosis

Explanation:

* A. Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the skin and mucous membranes, causing blisters and sores. While DEB can present with similar symptoms, such as recurrent skin blisters and erythema, it is typically associated with skin fragility and scarring, and the blisters are usually larger and more widespread. The absence of oral erosions and difficulty in feeding, as well as the presence of milia formation, are not consistent with DEB.
* B. Chronic bullous disease of childhood (CBDC) is a rare autoimmune disorder that causes recurrent blisters and skin lesions. CBDC typically presents in children under the age of 5, and the blisters are usually larger and more widespread than those seen in bullous mastocytosis. The presence of urticated papules and plaques, as well as the absence of mucosal involvement, are not consistent with CBDC.
* D. Congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the production of heme, a component of hemoglobin. CEP can cause skin symptoms such as blistering, but it is typically associated with other symptoms such as anemia, jaundice, and enlarged liver and spleen. The absence of these systemic symptoms and the presence of mast cell infiltrate in the skin suggest that CEP is unlikely.

Bullous mastocytosis, on the other hand, is a rare disorder characterized by the accumulation of mast cells in the skin, leading to the formation of blisters and bullae. The symptoms described in the case, such as recurrent skin blisters, pruritus, and redness, are consistent with bullous mastocytosis. The presence of a bandlike mast cell infiltrate in the upper dermis, as well as the dense infiltrate of mast cells in the upper dermis, are also consistent with this diagnosis. Therefore, option

A: Consider the risk of adverse events and which drugs are approved for use is the correct answer because it is important to assess the patient's medical history and current symptoms to determine the best course of treatment. This includes considering the risk of adverse events associated with various medications, as well as which drugs are approved for use in treating schizophrenia. In this case, the patient has a history of poor response to citalopram and has exhibited symptoms of psychosis, such as auditory hallucinations and delusions, which suggest a need for antipsychotic medication. Therefore, it is important to consider the risk of adverse events associated with antipsychotic medications, such as weight gain, metabolic changes, and extrapyramidal side effects, and to determine which medications are approved for use in treating first-episode schizophrenia.
B: Commence treatment with oral olanzapine is an incorrect answer because, although olanzapine is an antipsychotic medication that is approved for use in treating schizophrenia, it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient. The patient has a history of poor response to citalopram, which suggests that she may not respond well to other medications in the same class, such as olanzapine. Additionally, olanzapine has a higher risk of metabolic side effects, such as weight gain and hyperglycemia, which may be a concern for this patient given her history of overweight.
C: Commence treatment with oral clozapine is an incorrect answer because, although clozapine is an antipsychotic medication that is sometimes used as a last resort for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, it is not typically used as a first-line treatment for first-episode schizophrenia. Clozapine has a number of potential side effects, including agranulocytosis, which requires regular monitoring of white blood cell counts, and it may not be appropriate for this patient given her young age and lack of treatment resistance.
D: Commence cognitive behavioral therapy for psychosis is an incorrect answer because, although cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can be a useful adjunct to medication in treating psychosis, it is not a substitute for medication in this case

**Answer**:B. Bone marrow–liver–spleen type of large B-cell lymphoma

The patient's symptoms and test results point to a hematological malignancy, particularly a B-cell lymphoma. The patient's splenomegaly, pancytopenia, high LDH and ferritin levels, and positive Pax-5 staining on bone marrow biopsy all support this diagnosis.

The patient's symptoms and test results point to a hematological malignancy, particularly a B-cell lymphoma. The patient's splenomegaly, pancytopenia, high LDH and ferritin levels, and positive Pax-5 staining on bone marrow biopsy all support this diagnosis.

Infectious bone-marrow disease (choice A) is unlikely because the patient did not report any bone pain, and the bone-marrow biopsy results showed a diffuse infiltrate of large lymphoid cells with scattered residual hematopoietic elements, which is consistent with lymphoma.

Primary bone lymphoma (choice C) is less likely because the patient had a history of seronegative autoimmune constrictive pericarditis and pleural effusions, which suggests a systemic lymphoma. Additionally, the patient's bone-marrow biopsy results showed a diffuse infiltrate of large lymphoid cells, which is more consistent with a disseminated lymphoma.

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (choice D) is unlikely because the patient's bone-marrow biopsy results did not show any evidence of hemophagocytosis, and the patient's liver and spleen were not enlarged, which are common findings in hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Bone marrow–liver–spleen type of large B-cell lymphoma.

**Answer**: C. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of a regular wide complex tachycardia with electrolyte derangements, specifically hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, suggests a possible underlying cardiac condition. The patient's history of bulimia also increases the likelihood of an electrolyte imbalance. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most appropriate next step in diagnosing and managing the patient's condition.

Cardiac MRI can help identify any structural abnormalities in the heart, such as left ventricular hypertrophy, which may be indicative of an underlying cardiac condition. Additionally, MRI can assess cardiac function and identify any areas of scar tissue or inflammation, which may be contributing to the patient's arrhythmia.

Coronary angiography (choice A) may be necessary in the future, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's symptoms and electrocardiogram (ECG) do not suggest a significant coronary artery disease.

Ambulatory cardiac monitoring (choice B) may be useful in detecting any arrhythmic episodes or monitoring the effectiveness of treatment, but it is not the most appropriate next step in diagnosing the underlying cause of the patient's condition.

Invasive electrophysiology study (choice D) is a more invasive procedure that carries risks and is not necessary at this point in the patient's management. It may be considered in the future if other diagnostic tests do not provide a clear diagnosis or if the patient's arrhythmia persists despite treatment.

Therefore, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (choice C) is the most appropriate next step in diagnosing and managing the patient's condition.

**Answer**: C. Lateral saccular cyst

The answer is C. Lateral saccular cyst because it is the most likely diagnosis based on the symptoms and findings described in the case.

A. Granular cell tumor is an unlikely diagnosis because it is a rare benign tumor that typically affects the larynx in adults, and is not commonly seen in neonates. Additionally, the symptoms described in the case, such as stridor and respiratory distress, are not typically associated with granular cell tumors.

B. Laryngeal neurofibroma is also an unlikely diagnosis because it is a rare benign tumor that typically affects the larynx in children and adults, and is not commonly seen in neonates. Moreover, the symptoms described in the case, such as stridor and respiratory distress, are not typically associated with laryngeal neurofibroma.

D. Macrocystic lymphatic malformation is an unlikely diagnosis because it is a rare congenital malformation that typically affects the neck and thorax, and is not commonly seen in the larynx. Moreover, the symptoms described in the case, such as stridor and respiratory distress, are not typically associated with macrocystic lymphatic malformations.

C. Lateral saccular cyst, on the other hand, is a common congenital malformation that can occur in the larynx, and can cause symptoms such as stridor and respiratory distress. The fact that the mass was soft and fluctuant on palpation and that it involved the left side of the epiglottis, false fold, aryepiglottic fold, and arytenoid, as described in the case, are also consistent with a lateral saccular cyst. Therefore, option C is the most likely diagnosis.

**Answer**: D. Spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma

The correct answer is D. Spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma because it best matches the patient's symptoms and test results described in the case study.

A. Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) is a type of soft tissue sarcoma that can arise in various parts of the body, including the head and neck. However, MFH typically affects the skin and subcutaneous tissue, and it is rare for it to involve the temporal bone or infratemporal fossa. Moreover, the histopathologic features of MFH are not consistent with the spindle cell morphology described in the case study. Therefore, option A is incorrect.

B. Paraganglioma is a type of rare tumor that originates from the paraganglia, which are clusters of cells located near the sympathetic nerve fibers. Paragangliomas can occur in various parts of the body, including the head and neck. However, they typically present with symptoms related to cranial nerve dysfunction, such as hoarseness, dysphagia, or facial weakness, which are not mentioned in the case study. Additionally, the histopathologic features of paraganglioma are not consistent with the spindle cell morphology described in the case study. Therefore, option B is incorrect.

C. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a common type of skin cancer that can arise in various parts of the body, including the head and neck. SCC can infiltrate surrounding tissues and bones, causing symptoms such as pain, swelling, or difficulty swallowing. However, the patient in the case study had a history of metastatic SCC in the left parotid gland and hypopharynx, which were treated with surgery and radiation therapy. The current symptoms and imaging findings do not suggest a recurrence of SCC. Moreover, the histopathologic features of SCC are not consistent with the spindle cell morphology described in the case study. Therefore, option C is incorrect.

B. Thyroglossal duct cyst is an incorrect choice because it is a type of cyst that forms in the neck, usually resulting from the persistence of a portion of the thyroglossal duct. It typically presents as a painless mass in the neck, and is not associated with a midline anterior neck lesion.

C. Cutaneous bronchogenic cyst is an incorrect choice because it is a type of congenital cyst that arises from the embryonic bronchial apparatus and typically presents as a skin-colored or pink papule or nodule on the chest, back, or neck. It is not associated with the midline anterior neck.

D. Midline anterior neck inclusion cyst is the correct answer because it is a type of cyst that forms in the midline of the anterior neck, typically presenting as a small, soft, and mobile nodule. It is usually asymptomatic and can be diagnosed by ultrasonography, which showed a superficial cutaneous lesion without evidence of tracking into deeper layers of subcutaneous tissue or fluid collection, consistent with the case presentation.

**Answer**: B. Hibernoma

A. Liposarcoma: Liposarcoma is a type of soft tissue sarcoma that arises from fat cells. While it's possible that a liposarcoma could present as a neck mass, the histopathologic features described in the case, such as the uniform univacuolar and multivacuolated granular eosinophilic cells with centrally placed nucleoli, are not typical of liposarcoma. Liposarcoma typically has a more pleomorphic appearance, with a mix of small, round cells and larger, irregular cells.

C. Angiolipoma: Angiolipoma is a benign tumor of blood vessels that can occur in the soft tissues of the neck. However, the histopathologic features described in the case do not match the characteristic features of angiolipoma, which typically shows a proliferation of thin-walled blood vessels with a "sawtooth" pattern.

D. Lipoma: Lipoma is a benign tumor of fat cells that can occur in the soft tissues of the neck. However, the histopathologic features described in the case, such as the uniform univacuolar and multivacuolated granular eosinophilic cells with centrally placed nucleoli, are not typical of lipoma. Lipoma typically has a more homogeneous appearance, with a mix of mature adipocytes and scattered inflammatory cells.

B. Hibernoma: Hibernoma is a rare benign tumor of the soft tissues that is composed of brown adipose tissue. The histopathologic features described in the case, such as the yellowish-brown, homogenous, lobular adipose tissue covered by a thin, tan, transparent membrane, are consistent with hibernoma. Additionally, the patient's symptoms of waxing and waning pain that radiated to the back of her neck, headaches, and intermittent dysphagia, as well as the fluctuation in size of the mass, are consistent with the clinical presentation of hibernoma.

**Answer**:C. Stop the ATRA and start steroids

Explanation:

A. Continue chemotherapy therapy and observe: This choice is incorrect because the patient's sudden vision loss and fundus findings are suggestive of a severe ocular toxicity. Continuing chemotherapy without addressing the ocular toxicity may lead to further vision loss and permanent damage.

B. Order magnetic resonance imaging of brain and orbits with and without contrast and lumbar puncture: This choice is incorrect because while imaging studies may be necessary to rule out other causes of vision loss, they are not the most urgent step in management. The patient's symptoms and fundus findings are highly suggestive of acute retinal toxicity, and prompt treatment is needed to prevent further vision loss.

D. Send HLA-B51 and start steroids: This choice is incorrect because HLA-B51 testing is not relevant to the patient's current condition. The patient's symptoms and fundus findings are consistent with acute retinal toxicity, and steroids may not be effective in reversing the damage.

C. Stop the ATRA and start steroids: This is the correct answer. The patient's sudden vision loss and fundus findings are consistent with acute retinal toxicity, likely related to the ATRA therapy. Stopping the ATRA and starting steroids can help to reduce the inflammation and prevent further vision loss. The steroids may also help to reduce the risk of further retinal damage.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Stop the ATRA and start steroids.

**Answer**: C. Administer intravitreal foscarnet and initiate valganciclovir

Explanation:

A. Administer intravitreal clindamycin: This choice is incorrect because clindamycin is an antibiotic that is not effective against viral infections such as herpetic retinitis. While it may be used in combination with other medications to treat bacterial conjunctivitis or other ocular infections, it is not the appropriate choice for this patient's condition.

B. Administer intravitreal foscarnet and admit for intravenous acyclovir: This choice is incorrect because while intravitreal foscarnet is a appropriate medication for herpetic retinitis, intravenous acyclovir is not necessary for this patient's condition. The patient has already received a recent course of chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow transplant, which puts them at high risk for infection. Administering intravenous acyclovir would increase the risk of fungal infections and other complications.

D. Administer an intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor agent followed by panretinal photocoagulation: This choice is incorrect because while anti-VEGF agents are commonly used to treat retinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy, they are not effective against herpetic retinitis. Additionally, panretinal photocoagulation may not be effective in treating the patient's diffuse retinal involvement.

C. Administer intravitreal foscarnet and initiate valganciclovir: This is the correct answer because it addresses the patient's herpetic retinitis with a medication that has been shown to be effective in treating this condition (foscarnet). Additionally, valganciclovir is an oral antiviral medication that can be used to treat herpetic retinitis and prevent recurrences. Initiating valganciclovir in this patient would provide additional protection against herpetic retinitis recurrences, which is important given the patient's history of limited immune dysfunction and previous episodes of herpetic

**Answer**: B. Perform a complete excisional biopsy of the lesion

The correct answer is B because a complete excisional biopsy of the lesion is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's atypical conjunctival lesion. The patient's history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) with transformation to large B-cell lymphoma, as well as the recent history of bladder cancer, suggests that the lesion may be a manifestation of a systemic malignancy.

A complete excisional biopsy of the lesion would allow for a thorough histopathological evaluation, which would help to determine the nature of the lesion and guide further management. This approach is supported by the fact that the patient's symptoms have not responded to oral prednisone therapy, which suggests that the lesion may be resistant to steroid treatment and may require a different approach.

In contrast, administering intralesional corticosteroids (choice A) may not be effective in treating a malignant lesion, and may even mask the true nature of the lesion, leading to a delay in appropriate treatment. Administering topical antibiotics (choice C) would not be appropriate, as there is no evidence of an active infection. Obtaining magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits (choice D) may be considered later in the management of the patient, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this point.

Therefore, based on the patient's history and symptoms, as well as the clinical findings, a complete excisional biopsy of the lesion is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's atypical conjunctival lesion.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain it in detail.

The correct answer is C. Start oral antiviral and topical antibiotic therapy.

Here's why:

A. Start topical antibiotics:
This choice is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a viral infection, not a bacterial infection. Topical antibiotics would not be effective in treating a viral infection, and using them could lead to unnecessary side effects and antibiotic resistance.

B. Start oral antiviral therapy:
This choice is also incorrect because while oral antiviral therapy may be effective in treating some viral infections, it is not the best approach for treating keratitis caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV). HSV keratitis is typically treated with topical antiviral medications, which are more effective and targeted to the affected area.

D. Admit patient for intravenous antiviral therapy:
This choice is incorrect because the patient's condition does not require hospitalization or intravenous antiviral therapy. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a mild to moderate case of HSV keratitis, which can be effectively treated with topical antiviral medications and supportive care.

C. Start oral antiviral and topical antibiotic therapy:
This choice is correct because it covers both the topical and systemic aspects of the infection. The patient's history of recurrent HSV keratitis and the presence of madarosis, mild eyelid edema, and conjunctival injection suggest that the infection may be caused by a reactivation of the virus. Topical antiviral medications can help to treat the keratitis and prevent further damage to the cornea. Oral antiviral therapy can help to reduce the severity and duration of the infection, and may also help to prevent recurrences. Additionally, topical antibiotics can help to treat any secondary bacterial infections that may have developed.

Therefore, the best approach would be to start both oral antiviral and topical antibiotic therapy to effectively manage the patient'

**Answer**:A. Begin antimicrobial therapy

The correct answer is A, Begin antimicrobial therapy, because the patient's symptoms of fever, diarrhea, and weight loss, along with the elevated inflammatory markers, suggest a possible infection. The patient's history of inflammatory polyarthritis and recent development of symptoms suggestive of gastrointestinal involvement also support the possibility of an infection.

 choice B, Initiate intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, is not appropriate at this time because there is no indication of an immune-mediated disorder or a need for immunosuppression.

 choice C, Perform genetic analysis for evaluation of hematologic malignancy, is not relevant to the patient's current symptoms and medical history.

 choice D, Refer to a nutritionist for education on gluten-free diet, may be appropriate at some point, but it is not the most pressing concern given the patient's current symptoms and medical history.

Therefore, the best next step would be to begin antimicrobial therapy to treat the possible infection and address the patient's symptoms.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is B: Prescribe antibiotics followed by anthelminthic therapy.

The patient's symptoms of fever, abdominal pain, and jaundice, along with the laboratory results of elevated liver enzymes and bilirubin, suggest a possible biliary tract infection. The presence of worms in the biliary tree, as revealed by endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), supports this diagnosis.

Antibiotics should be prescribed to treat the biliary tract infection, as the presence of worms in the biliary tree can cause inflammation and infection. The antibiotics will help to clear the infection and reduce the risk of further complications.

After the infection has been treated, anthelminthic therapy should be prescribed to eliminate the worms in the biliary tree. Anthelminthic therapy is effective in treating Ascaris infections, which are the most common type of worm infection in the biliary tree.

The other options are not the best choices for several reasons:

A: Prescribing anthelminthic therapy alone may not be effective in treating the biliary tract infection, as the worms may not be the only cause of the infection.

C: Ordering a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for Ascaris may not be necessary at this stage, as the diagnosis of a biliary tract infection and the presence of worms in the biliary tree have already been confirmed by ERCP.

D: Ordering serum serologic testing for Ascaris may not be useful, as the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are not consistent with a serum sickness-like reaction, which is the typical presentation of Ascaris infection.

Therefore, the best course of action is to prescribe antibiotics followed by anthelminthic therapy to treat the biliary tract infection and eliminate the worms in the biliary tree.

**Answer**:C. Discontinue ibuprofen

The correct answer is C. Discontinue ibuprofen because the patient has a history of a similar eruption at the same site with spontaneous resolution 1 year previously, after she had taken a cold medication containing ibuprofen. This suggests that the patient may have a hypersensitivity reaction to ibuprofen, which is a common cause of blisters and other skin eruptions. Discontinuing ibuprofen would help to prevent further exposure to the potential allergen and allow the skin to heal.

Option A, administering valacyclovir, is not the correct answer because the patient does not have a history of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, and there is no indication for antiviral therapy.

Option B, discontinuing all cosmetics, is not the correct answer because there is no evidence to suggest that cosmetics are playing a role in the patient's condition.

Option D, administering antibiotics, is not the correct answer because the patient does not have a bacterial infection. Antibiotics would not be effective in treating the patient's symptoms and may cause unnecessary side effects.

**Answer**: B. Late cutaneous bilharziasis

The correct answer is B, Late cutaneous bilharziasis, because the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with this diagnosis.

Onchocerciasis, or river blindness, is a parasitic infection caused by Onchocerca volvulus that is transmitted through the bite of an infected blackfly. It is characterized by skin rashes, eye lesions, and vision loss. While Onchocerciasis can cause skin nodules, the histopathologic features described in the case, such as pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia and transepidermal elimination of basophilic oval-shaped structures, are not typical of this condition. Therefore, option A is incorrect.

Periorificial cutaneous tuberculosis is a form of tuberculosis that affects the skin and subcutaneous tissue around the mouth, nose, and eyes. It is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is characterized by the formation of granulomas and caseating necrosis. While granulomas are present in the histopathologic specimen described in the case, the presence of numerous dermal structures surrounded by a dense acute and chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate with granuloma formation, and the absence of caseating necrosis, makes this diagnosis less likely. Therefore, option C is incorrect.

Granuloma inguinale, also known as donovanosis, is a sexually transmitted infection caused by Klebsiella granulomatis. It is characterized by the formation of granulomas in the genital area. While granulomas are present in the histopathologic specimen described in the case, the location of the lesion on the labium majus and the absence of any history of sexual contact make this diagnosis unlikely. Therefore, option D is incorrect.

Late cutaneous bilharziasis, also known as bilharzial dermatitis, is a skin manifestation of schistosomiasis, a parasitic infection caused by Schistosoma haematobium. It is characterized by the formation of papular

**Answer**:B. Extrafacial granuloma faciale

The correct answer is B, Extrafacial granuloma faciale, for the following reasons:

A. Sweet syndrome: This is an uncommon diagnosis for this type of lesion. Sweet syndrome is a rare condition characterized by the rapid growth of small blood vessels, typically in the setting of systemic disease or medication use. The patient's lack of relevant medical history and the absence of other cutaneous or mucosal lesions make this diagnosis less likely.

C. Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia: This diagnosis is also unlikely given the patient's age and the absence of a history of trauma or infection. Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia typically affects younger patients and is associated with a history of trauma or infection.

D. Leishmaniasis: This diagnosis is unlikely given the patient's lack of travel history and the absence of other symptoms consistent with Leishmaniasis. Leishmaniasis is a parasitic infection that is typically found in tropical and subtropical regions and is characterized by skin lesions, fever, and other systemic symptoms.

In contrast, Extrafacial granuloma faciale is a rare benign tumor that typically presents as a slowly growing, painless nodule on the earlobe, as seen in this case. The histopathologic findings of mixed diffuse dermatitis involving the reticular dermis, with small-vessel vasculitis, characteristic sparing of a superficial dermal grenz zone, and mixed leukocytic infiltrate with eosinophils, lymphocytes, and neutrophils involving the full thickness of the vessel wall, are consistent with this diagnosis.

Sure! Here's my explanation:

**Answer**: C. Pulmonary arteriovenous shunt

The patient's symptoms of seizures, altered consciousness, and facial flushing, along with the physical examination findings of clubbing and papilledema, suggest a possible diagnosis of a pyogenic brain abscess. The presence of a ring-enhancing lesion with surrounding brain edema and mass effects on the cranial magnetic resonance image supports this diagnosis. The chest radiograph showing a nodular shadow in the left middle field of the lung suggests a possible lung infection, which could be the source of the bacterial emboli that caused the brain abscess.

The patient's history of being a vegetarian, nonsmoker, and nondrinker, and his lack of a history of fever, head trauma, limb weakness, or vomiting, make option A, Encysted empyema thoracis, less likely. Empyema thoracis is typically caused by an infection of the lung, which can lead to the formation of a cavity filled with pus. While the patient does have a lung infection, the presence of a brain abscess and the absence of fever and other symptoms suggestive of a lung infection make encysted empyema thoracis less likely.

Option B, Lung abscess, is also less likely given the patient's symptoms and examination findings. While the patient does have a lung infection, the presence of a brain abscess and the absence of symptoms such as fever, chest pain, and cough suggestive of a lung abscess make this option less likely.

Option D, Bronchogenic carcinoma, is unlikely given the patient's age and lack of smoking history. Bronchogenic carcinoma is typically seen in older patients with a history of smoking.

Therefore, option C, Pulmonary arteriovenous shunt, is the most likely diagnosis given the patient's symptoms and examination findings. A pulmonary arteriovenous shunt is a connection between the pulmonary artery and the pulmonary vein, which can cause blood to bypass the lung tissue and lead to the formation of a

**Answer**: C. Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis

Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the brain and tendons. It is caused by a mutation in the CYP27A1 gene, which codes for an enzyme involved in the metabolism of lipids. The mutation leads to an accumulation of lipids in the brain and tendons, resulting in the formation of xanthomas, which are painless masses of lipid-rich material.

The patient's symptoms, such as cognitive decline, memory loss, and changes in personality, are consistent with CTX. The physical examination findings, including unstable balance while walking, positive ankle clonus bilaterally, positive Babinski sign bilaterally, positive Chaddock sign bilaterally, and positive Romberg sign, are also consistent with CTX. The patient's elevated triglyceride level and the abnormal signal in the brain and ankle joint MRI are further evidence of CTX.

The other answer choices are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and examination findings. Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a group of neurodegenerative disorders that affect the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain, leading to changes in personality, behavior, and language. While the patient's cognitive decline and memory loss may be consistent with FTD, the presence of xanthomas and the abnormal signal in the brain and ankle joint MRI are not typical of FTD.

Wilson disease is a genetic disorder that affects the metabolism of copper, leading to an accumulation of copper in the liver, brain, and other organs. While Wilson disease can cause neurological symptoms, such as tremors, ataxia, and cognitive decline, it does not typically cause xanthomas or elevated triglyceride levels.

Autoimmune encephalitis is a condition in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the brain, leading to inflammation and damage to brain tissue. While autoimmune encephalitis can cause cognitive decline,

**Answer**:B. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of dyspnea, orthopnea, and tachypnea, along with the echocardiogram findings of a normal left ventricular ejection fraction and an echogenic band traversing the apical portion of the left ventricle, suggest the possibility of a cardiac condition. The patient's history of hereditary spherocytosis, polycythemia vera, hemochromatosis, hypereosinophilia, and asymptomatic paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia also support the likelihood of a cardiac diagnosis.

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most appropriate next step in the patient's workup because it can provide detailed information about the structure and function of the heart, including the left ventricle, which is the primary focus of the patient's symptoms and echocardiogram findings. Cardiac MRI can help to identify potential causes of the patient's symptoms, such as left ventricular noncompaction, which is a condition characterized by abnormal development of the left ventricle during fetal life and can lead to decreased cardiac function and symptoms of heart failure.

Endomyocardial biopsy (choice A) may be considered in some cases of suspected cardiac disease, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's workup. While endomyocardial biopsy can provide valuable information about the myocardium, it is an invasive procedure that carries risks and may not be necessary in this case given the patient's relatively stable condition and the availability of less invasive diagnostic tests.

A whole-body positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan (choice C) may be useful in certain cases of suspected cardiac disease, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's workup. While this test can provide information about the body's metabolic activity, it may not provide the same level of detail about the heart's structure and function as cardiac MRI.

Genetic testing for noncompaction (choice D) may be considered in some cases of suspected cardiac disease,

**Answer**:B. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor

The correct diagnosis is B. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, as it best matches the clinical and pathological features described in the case.

A. Spindle cell carcinoma: This is an incorrect diagnosis as spindle cell carcinoma is a type of squamous cell carcinoma that typically affects the larynx and is associated with a history of tobacco use. The patient's history and the pathological features described do not support this diagnosis.

C. Laryngeal granuloma: This is an incorrect diagnosis as laryngeal granulomas are typically associated with a history of vocal cord trauma or chronic inflammation. The patient's history and the pathological features described do not support this diagnosis.

D. Plasmacytoma of the larynx: This is an incorrect diagnosis as plasmacytoma is a type of cancer that affects the plasma cells in the bone marrow. The patient's history and the pathological features described do not support this diagnosis.

The patient's symptoms of hoarseness and the presence of a vocal fold mass suggest a lesion affecting the larynx. The pathological features described, including a hemorrhagic exophytic mass, spindled, fibroblastic-myofibroblastic cells, and inflammatory cells, are consistent with an inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor. The negative staining for desmin, S100, P63, and cytokeratin and the positive staining for vimentin and ALK1 also support this diagnosis.

Therefore, the correct diagnosis is B. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor.

**Answer**: D. Glial heterotopia

The correct answer is D. Glial heterotopia because it best matches the patient's symptoms and test results described in the case.

A. Lipoma is a benign tumor composed of fat cells, usually found just under the skin. It is not a possible diagnosis for this patient because the mass is located in the subcutaneous fat of the right occiput and has irregular borders and infiltration into the paraspinal musculature, which is not consistent with the characteristics of a lipoma.

B. Rhabdomyosarcoma is a malignant tumor that develops from immature muscle cells. It is not a possible diagnosis for this patient because the tumor cells have oval nuclei and multiple small nucleoli surrounded by a pale eosinophilic and slightly fibrillary stroma, which is not consistent with the characteristics of rhabdomyosarcoma. Additionally, the patient's age and the location of the tumor are not typical for rhabdomyosarcoma.

C. Infantile hemangioma is a benign tumor of infancy that is composed of abnormal blood vessels. It is not a possible diagnosis for this patient because the tumor is not composed of blood vessels and does not have the characteristic appearance of an infantile hemangioma on imaging or histology.

**Answer**:B. Cerebral vein thrombosis

The correct answer is B. Cerebral vein thrombosis. This is because the patient's symptoms of isolated dysphagia and dysphonia, along with the finding of right vocal cord paralysis on laryngoscopic examination, suggest a lower cranial nerve palsy. The computed tomographic (CT) images with contrast show a thrombosis of the right sigmoid-jugular complex, which causes acute compression of the recurrent nerve as it follows the course of the cranial accessory nerve and then the vagus nerve. This compression leads to a lower cranial nerve palsy, which manifests as dysphagia and dysphonia.

A. Carotid artery dissection is an incorrect choice because there is no evidence of carotid artery dissection in the patient's history or imaging studies.

C. Posttraumatic central motor impairment is an incorrect choice because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a central motor impairment. The patient has isolated dysphagia and dysphonia, which suggests a lower cranial nerve palsy rather than a central motor impairment.

D. Postoperative laryngeal paralysis is an incorrect choice because the patient's symptoms developed on postoperative day 2, which is too early for postoperative laryngeal paralysis to occur. Additionally, the patient's symptoms are not consistent with postoperative laryngeal paralysis, which typically presents with a weak or absent cough, hoarseness, and difficulty speaking.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Cerebral vein thrombosis, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain why C. Kimura disease is the correct answer and why the other choices are incorrect.

**Answer**: C. Kimura disease

Kimura disease is a rare, benign inflammatory condition that affects the lymph nodes, particularly in the head and neck region. It is characterized by the proliferation of lymphoid tissue, with prominent eosinophilia and follicular hyperplasia. The clinical presentation of Kimura disease can vary, but it often presents as a painless, slowly growing mass in the neck or face.

In this case, the patient presented with a 3-year history of a steadily growing, increasingly pruritic, painless mass behind the right ear. The mass was mobile and nontender, with superficial excoriations, and there was no evidence of bleeding, ear pain, or fistula into the external auditory canal. The patient had an elevated absolute eosinophil count and eosinophilia percentage, which is consistent with Kimura disease.

The T1-weighted postcontrast magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck showed a heterogeneously enhancing mass with irregular borders in the right retroauricular space, with a tract coursing anteriorly toward the parotid gland. The excised mass was an enlarged lymph node with a smooth, pale core and no hemorrhage or necrosis. The capsule was moderately thickened by collagen fibrosis with focal areas of interstitial fibrosis. Reactive follicular hyperplasia was present with prominent eosinophilia in the interfollicular areas and within follicles, forming eosinophilic microabscesses and follicular cysts. These findings are all consistent with Kimura disease.

Now, let's discuss why the other choices are incorrect:

**Answer**:C. Repeat the whole-body positron emission tomography scan

The correct answer is C. Repeat the whole-body positron emission tomography scan. The patient has a history of stage IV breast cancer treated with letrozole, and the imaging findings of thickening and enhancement of both optic nerves, cranial nerve III in the right eye, cranial nerve V bilaterally, the pituitary infundibulum, and the hypothalamus, as well as adjacent cavernous sinuses, and leptomeningeal thickening over the convexities of the anterior frontal lobes, are concerning for a possible metastatic process. The patient's symptoms of decreased visual acuity, dyschromatopsia, relative afferent pupillary defect, and visual-field defects on the right side, as well as facial pain and paresthesias, are also consistent with a metastatic process.

Repeating the whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) scan would be the most appropriate next step, as it would provide additional information on the extent and location of any possible metastatic disease. This would help guide further management and treatment decisions.

Administering high-dose corticosteroids (choice A) may be considered for their anti-inflammatory effects, but it would not provide any additional information on the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.

Repeating the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain (choice B) may also be considered, but it would not provide any additional information that would change the management of the patient's symptoms.

Repeating the testing for angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (choice D) is not necessary at this time, as the patient's symptoms and imaging findings are more consistent with a metastatic process rather than an autoimmune disorder.

The patient in this case has chronic conjunctivitis with a pseudomembrane in the left eye, which is causing blepharedema, erythema, and discharge. The patient has already tried topical steroids, antibiotics, and serum tears, but the symptoms have persisted.

Option A, starting treatment with systemic steroids, may help reduce inflammation, but it is not targeting the root cause of the problem, which is the pseudomembrane in the conjunctiva.

Option B, performing a dacryocystorhinostomy, is not necessary at this point, as the patient does not have any nasolacrimal duct obstruction or dacryostenosis.

Option D, performing a canaliculotomy, is also not necessary, as the patient does not have any canalicular obstruction or stenosis.

Option C, sweeping the superior fornix, is the most appropriate next step in management. The superior fornix is a fold in the conjunctiva that can harbor bacteria and other debris, which can cause chronic inflammation and discharge. Sweeping the superior fornix can help remove any debris or bacteria that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms, and can be done in conjunction with topical antibiotics and steroids to further reduce inflammation.

The correct answer is D, Perform a full-thickness eyelid resection with intraoperative control of margins, because it is the most appropriate treatment option for a pigmented lesion on the eyelid that has been present for 6 weeks and has ulcerated, notched the eyelid margin, and caused madarosis.

Option A, Treat with hot compresses and an antibiotic-steroid ointment, may provide some symptomatic relief, but it is unlikely to effectively treat the underlying condition, which appears to be a benign tumor.

Option B, Perform an incision and drainage, may be appropriate for an abscess or cyst, but it is not the best approach for a pigmented lesion that has been present for an extended period and has ulcerated.

The correct answer is C. Initiate vitamin C supplementation.

The patient's history of recurrent venous thromboembolism, peripheral edema, and widespread hematomas suggests a bleeding disorder. The low folic acid level and normal vitamin B12 level suggest a deficiency in vitamin C, which is important for folate metabolism. Vitamin C deficiency can lead to bleeding diathesis, which would explain the patient's symptoms.

Option A, ordering a bone marrow biopsy, is not necessary at this point in the patient's workup. While a bone marrow biopsy may be helpful in diagnosing certain hematologic disorders, it is not specifically indicated in this case given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

Option B, administering prothrombin complex concentrate, is also not appropriate at this time. Prothrombin complex concentrate is used to treat bleeding episodes in patients with severe vitamin K-dependent coagulopathy, but it is not indicated in patients with vitamin C deficiency.

Option D, ordering additional coagulation tests (thrombin time, platelet function assay), may be helpful in evaluating the patient's coagulation status, but it is not the most appropriate next step in the patient's management. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a bleeding disorder, and initiating vitamin C supplementation is a more urgent and appropriate intervention.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Initiate vitamin C supplementation.

**Answer**: D. Perform a plasma INR test to confirm POC INR test results.

The correct answer is D, Perform a plasma INR test to confirm POC INR test results, because the patient's POC INR result of 3.7 is higher than the desired therapeutic range of 2.0 to 3.0. This suggests that the patient may be at a higher risk of bleeding. Before making any changes to the patient's warfarin dosage, it is important to confirm the POC INR result with a plasma INR test, which is a more accurate and reliable test. This will help to ensure that the patient's anticoagulation therapy is appropriately managed and that the risk of bleeding or thrombosis is minimized.

Choice A, Continue current warfarin dosing and perform a point-of-care (POC) international normalized ratio (INR) test in 1 week, is not the best option because it does not address the elevated INR result and may put the patient at further risk of bleeding.

Choice B, Skip 2 doses of warfarin then resume current dosage and perform a POC INR test in 2 weeks, is also not the best option. Skipping doses of warfarin may lead to a decrease in the patient's INR, which could increase the risk of thrombosis. Additionally, this approach does not address the current elevated INR result and may not provide adequate monitoring of the patient's anticoagulation therapy.

Choice C, Skip 2 doses of warfarin, reduce weekly dosage by 10%, and perform a POC INR in 2 weeks, is not the best option for the same reasons as Choice B. Reducing the patient's warfarin dosage without confirming the elevated INR result may put the patient at risk of thrombosis.

**Answer**: D. Stop diltiazem drip and administer intravenous verapamil

The correct answer is D. Stop diltiazem drip and administer intravenous verapamil, as it is the most appropriate choice based on the patient's history of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and the current presentation of narrow complex tachycardia.

A. Stop diltiazem drip and administer intravenous amiodarone:
Amiodarone is an anti-arrhythmic drug that is commonly used to treat ventricular arrhythmias, but it is not the most appropriate choice for SVT. The patient has already received adenosine and direct current cardioversion, which are more effective for converting SVT, and amiodarone may not be effective in this case. Additionally, amiodarone has a long half-life and can take several days to reach therapeutic levels, making it less suitable for an emergency situation like this.

B. Repeat synchronized direct current cardioversion at 200 J:
Repeating direct current cardioversion at the same energy level (200 J) may not be effective in converting the arrhythmia, as the patient has already received multiple doses of adenosine and direct current cardioversion without success. It may be necessary to try a different approach, such as medication, to terminate the arrhythmia.

C. Switch to intravenous esmolol drip:
Esmolol is a beta-blocker that can be used to treat tachycardia, but it may not be the most appropriate choice in this case. The patient has already received a beta-blocker (metoprolol) and the arrhythmia has not been terminated. Additionally, esmolol has a slower onset of action compared to verapamil, which may be more effective in this emergency situation.

D. Stop diltiazem drip and administer intravenous verapamil:
Verapamil is a calcium channel blocker that can be used to treat SVT, and it has a faster onset of action compared to esmolol. It can also slow the heart rate and reduce the risk of rec

The correct answer is A, Periumbilical pseudoxanthoma elasticum, for the following reasons:

A. Periumbilical pseudoxanthoma elasticum is a rare benign condition characterized by yellowish papules or plaques in the periumbilical region. The clinical presentation and dermoscopic features of the case match this diagnosis. The patient's age and obesity also support this diagnosis, as pseudoxanthoma elasticum tends to affect middle-aged to elderly individuals, and there is a higher prevalence in obese individuals.

B. Periumbilical pseudoxanthoma elasticum-like papillary dermal elastolysis is a rare variant of pseudoxanthoma elasticum that presents with papillary dermal elastolysis. While the clinical presentation and dermoscopic features may resemble the case, the absence of follicular plugging and linear vessels on dermoscopy, as well as the presence of clumped eosinophilic elastic fibers in the middermis on histopathology, argue against this diagnosis.

C. Elastosis perforans serpiginosa is a rare condition characterized by minute, yellowish, perforating papules on the face, neck, and upper trunk. While the clinical presentation may resemble the case, the absence of a perforating pattern on dermoscopy and the presence of clumped eosinophilic elastic fibers in the middermis on histopathology argue against this diagnosis.

D. Late-onset focal dermal elastosis is a rare condition characterized by localized, yellowish, and slightly elevated plaques on the face and neck.

The correct answer is B, Primary cutaneous large B-cell lymphoma, leg type, for the following reasons:

A. Langerhans cell histiocytosis: This is an incorrect choice because Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disease that typically affects children and young adults, and is characterized by the proliferation of Langerhans cells, which are a type of dendritic cell. The clinical presentation and histopathological features of Langerhans cell histiocytosis are different from those described in the case.

C. Merkel cell carcinoma: This is an incorrect choice because Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare type of skin cancer that typically affects the elderly and is characterized by a nodular, firm, and painless skin lesion. The histopathological features of Merkel cell carcinoma are different from those described in the case, and it is not typically associated with a dense dermal infiltrate of cells.

D. Cutaneous angiosarcoma: This is an incorrect choice because cutaneous angiosarcoma is a rare type of skin cancer that typically affects the elderly and is characterized by a rapidly growing, painful skin lesion with a characteristic "sieve-like" or "spiculated" border. The histopathological features of cutaneous angiosarcoma are different from those described in the case, and it is not typically associated with a dense dermal infiltrate of cells.

In contrast, Primary cutaneous large B-cell lymphoma, leg type, is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that typically affects the elderly and is characterized by a large, nodular, or infiltrative skin lesion. The histopathological features of Primary cutaneous large B-cell lymphoma, leg type, are consistent with those described in the case, including a dense dermal infiltrate of large atypical cells with scanty cytoplasm. Therefore, B is the correct answer.

**Answer**:C. Chorea-acanthocytosis

The patient's symptoms, such as involuntary orofaciolingual movements, dysphagia, dysarthria, and gait disturbances, are consistent with chorea-acanthocytosis. Chorea-acanthocytosis is a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive chorea, cognitive decline, and acanthocytosis (abnormal red blood cell shapes) on blood smear. The patient's blood smear showed acanthocytes, which supports this diagnosis.

Option A, pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration, is a rare genetic disorder that can cause progressive supranuclear palsy, dementia, and axonal degeneration. Although the patient's cognitive decline and gait disturbances may be consistent with this diagnosis, the presence of acanthocytosis and chorea-like movements suggests chorea-acanthocytosis as a more likely diagnosis.

Option B, hypobetalipoproteinemia, is a rare genetic disorder that can cause a decrease in apolipoprotein B, leading to low levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). The patient's low LDL and apolipoprotein B levels may be consistent with this diagnosis, but the presence of neurological symptoms and acanthocytosis makes chorea-acanthocytosis a more likely diagnosis.

Option D, Huntington disease-like 2, is a rare genetic disorder that can cause progressive cognitive decline, chorea, and other neurological symptoms. However, the patient's age of onset (30 years old) and the absence of a family history suggest chorea-acanthocytosis as a more likely diagnosis.

In summary, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, including acanthocytosis and low LDL and apolipoprotein B levels, are consistent with chorea-acanthocytosis. While other diagnoses may also be considered

**Answer**: A. Transthoracic echocardiogram

The correct answer is A, Transthoracic echocardiogram, because it is the most appropriate test to evaluate the pacemaker lead position and ensure that it is properly placed in the ventricle. The patient's symptoms of recurrent stroke and aphasia, along with the abnormal chest radiography findings, suggest the possibility of a lead displacement or malposition. A transthoracic echocardiogram can provide valuable information about the lead's position, orientation, and stability within the heart, which can help guide further management and prevent complications.

**Answer**: B. Screen for thrombophilia

Although screening for thrombophilia may be appropriate in patients with recurrent stroke, it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's pacemaker and recent stroke symptoms suggest a potential cardiac source for the stroke, and evaluating the pacemaker lead position is a more pressing concern.

**Answer**: C. Prolonged Holter monitoring

Prolonged Holter monitoring may be useful in detecting arrhythmic events or pacemaker dysfunction, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's symptoms and chest radiography findings suggest a potential lead displacement or malposition, which requires prompt evaluation and management.

**Answer**: D. Take serial blood cultures

Taking serial blood cultures may be appropriate in patients with fever or suspected infection, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's symptoms and chest radiography findings suggest a cardiac source for the stroke, and evaluating the pacemaker lead position is a more pressing concern.

**Answer**:B. PPV plus pathological examination plus genetic test

The patient's symptoms and family history suggest a possible inherited vitreoretinal disorder. While option A, aqueous humor biopsy, may provide some information about the vitreous opacity, it may not be sufficient to diagnose a genetic disorder. Option C, abdominal ultrasonography, is not relevant to the patient's eye symptoms. Option D, follow-up, is not a specific diagnostic or therapeutic plan.

In contrast, option B, PPV plus pathological examination plus genetic test, provides a more comprehensive approach to diagnosing and managing the patient's condition. PPV allows for a thorough examination of the vitreous and retina, which can help identify any abnormalities. The pathological examination of the vitreous tissue can provide additional information about the nature of the vitreous opacity. Additionally, genetic testing can help identify any inherited genetic disorders that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. This combination of diagnostic tests can help provide a more accurate diagnosis and guide appropriate management.

**Answer**:B. Obtain orbital imaging

The patient's symptoms and findings, including a new retro-orbital hypoechoic cavity causing right globe deformation on B-scan ultrasonography, suggest the possibility of an orbital lesion. Obtaining orbital imaging, such as a CT or MRI scan, would be the appropriate next step to evaluate the extent and nature of the lesion. This would help to determine the appropriate management and follow-up for the patient.

Option A, performing fluorescein angiography, would not be the next best step as it is primarily used to evaluate the retina and choroidal circulation, and would not provide information about the orbital lesion.

Option C, recommending a liver biopsy, is not relevant to the patient's current symptoms and findings, and would not be appropriate at this time.

Option D, monitoring the patient with follow-up in 6 months, may be appropriate after obtaining additional information from orbital imaging, but without further evaluation, it would be difficult to determine the appropriate interval for follow-up and whether any changes in the lesion have occurred.

**Answer**:A. Investigate for sarcoidosis and tuberculosis; if negative, start treatment with steroids

The patient's symptoms and clinical findings, including blurred vision, hypertension, and an amelanotic choroidal mass with subretinal fluid, suggest a possible diagnosis of uveitis. Uveitis can be caused by various inflammatory conditions, including sarcoidosis and tuberculosis. Therefore, it is appropriate to investigate for these conditions before starting treatment with steroids.

Option B, treating the mass with radiotherapy, is not appropriate as the first line of treatment. While radiotherapy may be considered for cases of uveal melanoma, it is not typically used for inflammatory conditions such as uveitis.

Option C, referring the patient to a primary care physician for a metastatic workup, is also not appropriate as the first line of treatment. While metastatic disease should be considered in the differential diagnosis of uveitis, it is not the most likely diagnosis given the patient's age and clinical presentation.

Option D, proceeding with pars plana vitrectomy and biopsy, is not appropriate at this stage. While vitrectomy and biopsy may be necessary for definitive diagnosis and treatment of uveal melanoma, it is not the first step in management of uveitis.

Therefore, the correct answer is A, investigating for sarcoidosis and tuberculosis; if negative, starting treatment with steroids. This approach allows for a systematic evaluation of the patient's symptoms and clinical findings, and provides a appropriate treatment plan based on the underlying diagnosis.

**Answer**: B. Subungual squamous cell carcinoma

The correct answer is B, Subungual squamous cell carcinoma, because the clinical presentation and histopathological findings described in the case are consistent with this diagnosis.

The patient presented with a 7-year history of a painful subungual mass on the right thumb, which is a classic presentation for subungual squamous cell carcinoma. The physical examination findings of a subungual nodule with exudation and crusts, as well as destruction of the distal nail plate with onycholysis, are also consistent with this diagnosis.

The histopathological findings of proliferation of atypical squamous cells invading the dermis, as seen in the lesional biopsy, are diagnostic of squamous cell carcinoma. The large atypical squamous cells with hyperchromatic, pleomorphic, and atypical mitosis shown in the biopsy are also characteristic of squamous cell carcinoma.

In contrast, onychomycosis (choice A) is a fungal infection of the nail that does not typically present with a subungual mass or destruction of the nail plate. Subungual verruca vulgaris (choice C) is a benign growth that is usually smaller and less painful than the lesion described in the case. Subungual exostosis (choice D) is a benign bony growth that does not have the same clinical or histopathological features as squamous cell carcinoma.

Therefore, based on the clinical and histopathological findings described in the case, the most likely diagnosis is subungual squamous cell carcinoma.

**Answer**: D. Test for serum cryoglobulin level

The patient's symptoms of widespread painful purpura, fever, night sweats, and fatigue, along with the physical examination findings of diffuse, symmetric patches and soft, thin plaques of retiform purpura with minimally erythematous borders, are consistent with a diagnosis of cryoglobulinemia. Cryoglobulinemia is a condition where abnormal proteins in the blood clump together in cold temperatures, leading to the formation of blood clots and damage to blood vessels.

The correct answer, D. Test for serum cryoglobulin level, will help to confirm the diagnosis of cryoglobulinemia. A serum cryoglobulin test measures the level of cryoglobulins in the blood. If the test is positive, it supports the diagnosis of cryoglobulinemia.

The other answer choices are not relevant to the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

A. Administer empirical intravenous antibiotics: This choice is not appropriate because there is no evidence of an infection. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with cryoglobulinemia, not an infection.

B. Administer protein C concentrate: This choice is not appropriate because protein C concentrate is used to treat bleeding disorders, and there is no evidence of a bleeding disorder in this patient.

C. Calculate a calcium-phosphate product: This choice is not appropriate because there is no indication of a calcium or phosphate imbalance in the patient's blood work. Calculating a calcium-phosphate product would not help to diagnose or treat the patient's condition.

**Answer**:A. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma

The correct answer is A, Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, because the patient's symptoms and biopsy results are consistent with this diagnosis.

Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) is a type of cancer that affects the skin and can cause a variety of skin lesions, including papules, nodules, and plaques. The patient in this case has numerous pink-purple papules on his trunk and extremities, which is consistent with CTCL.

The biopsy results also support this diagnosis. The presence of a nodular to diffuse lymphohistiocytic infiltrate (hematoxylin-eosin) and admixed atypical, irregularly contoured lymphocytes with numerous histiocytes are both consistent with CTCL. Additionally, the low CD4 signal and robust CD8 signal (magnification ×20) suggest a T-cell dominant infiltrate, which is consistent with CTCL.

Granuloma annulare (choice B) is a benign skin condition characterized by the formation of small, firm papules or nodules on the skin. While the patient's skin lesions may resemble granuloma annulare, the presence of numerous papules on the extensor surfaces of the arms and legs, as well as the patient's history of polyarticular inflammatory arthritis and pulmonary symptoms, make CTCL a more likely diagnosis.

Small-vessel vasculitis (choice C) is a condition that causes inflammation in the small blood vessels of the skin and other organs. While the patient's skin lesions may resemble those seen in small-vessel vasculitis, the absence of other symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and abdominal pain, as well as the normal results of blood tests and imaging studies, make this diagnosis less likely.

Sarcoidosis (choice D) is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect various organs, including the skin, lungs, and lymph nodes. While the patient's lung symptoms and weight loss may be consistent with sarcoidosis, the skin les

**Answer**: D. Nevus comedonicus

Nevus comedonicus is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple small, flesh-colored or white papules on the skin, often with a central punctate dark core. The papules are typically found on the face, neck, and limbs, and may be accompanied by other skin manifestations such as acne, folliculitis, and keratosis pilaris.

In this case, the patient presented with grouped and circumscribed, firm, skin-colored, 1- to 3-mm papules with a central punctate dark core on the right palm and finger. The papules were asymptomatic and had been present since age 2 years. The patient had a history of partial improvement with previous treatments, including cryotherapy, pulsed dye laser, and 40% salicylic acid, but never complete clearance.

The clinical and histopathological features of the patient's papules are consistent with nevus comedonicus. The histopathological examination of a 4-mm punch biopsy from a papule on the palm showed a dilated follicular infundibulum with a keratinous core and absent hair shaft, which is a characteristic feature of nevus comedonicus.

In contrast, the other answer choices do not fit the patient's clinical and histopathological features.

A. Porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple small, flesh-colored or white papules on the skin, often with a central punctate dark core. However, the papules in this condition are typically located on the scalp, face, and neck, and are not usually found on the palms or soles.

**Answer**:B. Erdheim-Chester disease

The patient's symptoms of progressive neurological impairment, including numbness, incoordination, and imbalance, as well as the MRI findings of a brainstem lesion and dural enhancement, are consistent with Erdheim-Chester disease. This is a rare, slowly progressive, and often indolent neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages in the brain. The patient's age and the absence of other causes of neurodegeneration, such as Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease, also support this diagnosis.

The other choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and MRI findings.

A. Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease that can affect the nervous system, but it is unlikely to cause the type of progressive neurological impairment seen in this patient. Additionally, the MRI findings of a brainstem lesion and dural enhancement are not typical of sarcoidosis.

C. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that can affect the brain, but it is unlikely to cause the type of slow progression and focal brainstem lesion seen in this patient. Additionally, the patient's age and lack of other symptoms, such as fever or weight loss, make this diagnosis less likely.

D. Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis associated with myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody is a rare autoimmune disorder that can cause rapidly progressive neurological symptoms, but it is unlikely to cause the type of slow progression and focal brainstem lesion seen in this patient. Additionally, the patient's age and the absence of other symptoms, such as fever or headache, make this diagnosis less likely.

**Answer**: D. Switch ticagrelor to clopidogrel

The correct answer is D. Switch ticagrelor to clopidogrel, as it addresses the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, which is the bradycardia and high-grade atrioventricular (AV) block caused by the drug interaction between ticagrelor and metoprolol tartrate.

Ticagrelor is a P2Y12 inhibitor that works by inhibiting platelet activation and aggregation. It is commonly used in combination with aspirin to prevent thrombotic events in patients with acute coronary syndrome. However, ticagrelor has been shown to cause bradycardia and AV block in some patients, particularly when combined with other medications that slow the heart rate, such as metoprolol tartrate.

In this case, the patient's history of remote coronary artery bypass grafting and the recent percutaneous coronary intervention suggest that he has a high risk of cardiac events. Therefore, it is important to address the underlying cause of his symptoms, which is the drug interaction between ticagrelor and metoprolol tartrate.

Switching ticagrelor to clopidogrel, another P2Y12 inhibitor, will eliminate the drug interaction and reduce the risk of bradycardia and AV block. Clopidogrel has a different chemical structure than ticagrelor and is less likely to interact with metoprolol tartrate. Additionally, clopidogrel has a shorter half-life than ticagrelor, which means that it will be eliminated from the body faster, reducing the risk of prolonged bradycardia and AV block.

The other options are not appropriate for the following reasons:

A. Implant a permanent pacemaker: While a pacemaker may be necessary in some cases of bradycardia, it is not the first-line treatment for drug-induced bradycardia. In this case, the patient's bradycardia is a result of the drug interaction between ticagrelor and metoprolol tartrate, and switching to a different medication will address the underlying cause of the problem.

**Answer**: C. Ectopic thymus

The correct answer is C. Ectopic thymus because the patient's symptoms and imaging results are consistent with an ectopic thymus. The patient has a neck mass and intermittent inspiratory stridor, which are common symptoms associated with an ectopic thymus. The MRI results show a multispatial mildly enhancing mass within the bilateral retropharyngeal, parapharyngeal, and carotid spaces, which is consistent with the location and appearance of an ectopic thymus. Additionally, the presence of a vallecular cyst, which is a common association with ectopic thymus, supports this diagnosis.

A. Lipoma is an incorrect choice because it is a benign tumor composed of fat cells, and it does not explain the patient's symptoms or imaging results.

B. Branchial cleft cyst is an incorrect choice because it is a congenital anomaly that occurs when the branchial cleft fails to close during embryonic development, and it does not match the patient's symptoms or imaging results.

D. Rhabdomyosarcoma is an incorrect choice because it is a malignant tumor that arises from immature muscle cells, and it does not explain the patient's symptoms or imaging results.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Ectopic thymus.

The correct answer is B: Quantiferon and rapid plasma reagin tests and chest radiography.

This patient presents with bilateral retinal detachments, which could be caused by various conditions such as retinal degeneration, trauma, or inflammation. However, the patient's history of fever, chills, and coughing, along with the physical examination findings of mild conjunctival redness, anterior chamber cell, and flare, suggest a possible infectious etiology.

The Quantiferon and rapid plasma reagin tests are used to diagnose tuberculosis, which can cause ocular inflammation and retinal detachment. A positive result on these tests would indicate that the patient has been exposed to tuberculosis, and further investigation would be needed to determine if the retinal detachment is caused by tuberculous uveitis.

Chest radiography is also necessary to evaluate for any pulmonary abnormalities that may be related to tuberculosis.

Intravitreal triamcinolone (choice A) may be used to treat uveitis, but it is not the first step in the diagnostic workup.

Human leukocyte antigen genotyping (choice C) may be useful in certain cases of uveitis, but it is not typically performed as a first-line test.

A pars plana vitrectomy with a chorioretinal biopsy (choice D) may be necessary for definitive diagnosis and treatment of the retinal detachment, but it is not the first step in the diagnostic workup.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: Quantiferon and rapid plasma reagin tests and chest radiography.

**Answer**:B. Initiate course of topical ophthalmic antibiotics and corticosteroids

Explanation:

B. Initiate course of topical ophthalmic antibiotics and corticosteroids is the correct answer because it addresses the primary concern of the patient's bilateral limbus-sparing conjunctivitis and provides a comprehensive approach to managing the associated symptoms.

A. Recommend systemic corticosteroids is not the best choice because, while systemic corticosteroids may be beneficial in reducing inflammation, they may not directly target the underlying cause of the conjunctivitis. Moreover, systemic corticosteroids can have significant side effects, especially when used in children.

C. Perform amniotic membrane transplantation is not appropriate at this stage, as it is a surgical procedure that is typically considered for more severe cases of ocular surface disease, such as limbal stem cell deficiency or corneal perforation. The patient's condition, while severe, does not yet require such an intervention.

D. Discontinue antibiotics and avoid all medications associated with Stevens-Johnson syndrome may be a reasonable consideration, but it does not address the immediate need to manage the patient's ocular symptoms. The patient's history of allergies and rashes suggests that caution should be taken when prescribing medications, but discontinuing antibiotics without proper management of the conjunctivitis may lead to further complications.

Therefore, choice B, initiating a course of topical ophthalmic antibiotics and corticosteroids, provides the most comprehensive approach to managing the patient's symptoms while minimizing the risk of adverse effects.

**Answer**:C. Obtain an in-depth medical and personal history, including drug history

The correct answer is C. Obtain an in-depth medical and personal history, including drug history, because it is crucial to identify the underlying cause of the patient's bilateral foveal lesions. The patient's medical history, including any medications they are currently taking or have taken in the past, could provide valuable information about potential causes of intraocular inflammation. Additionally, a detailed personal history, such as exposure to toxins or any systemic diseases, could also help in determining the etiology of the lesions.

Option A, Prescribe laboratory testing to investigate causes of intraocular inflammation, may be necessary later on in the diagnostic process, but it is not the most appropriate next step. Laboratory testing may not provide a clear diagnosis without a more specific indication of the underlying condition.

Option B, Perform dye angiography, is not the most appropriate next step as it is an invasive procedure that may not provide any additional information that would help in determining the cause of the foveal lesions. Dye angiography is typically used to evaluate retinal vasculature and identify any abnormalities, but it may not be necessary at this point in the diagnostic process.

Option D, Treat patient with antiviral drugs, is incorrect as there is no indication that the patient has a viral infection. Additionally, antiviral medication may not be effective in treating the underlying cause of the foveal lesions.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to obtain an in-depth medical and personal history, including drug history, to help determine the underlying cause of the patient's bilateral foveal lesions.

**Answer**:B. Observation for the eye and MRI and magnetic resonance angiography of the head

The correct answer is B because the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a possible diagnosis of retinoblastoma, a malignant intraocular tumor that can affect children. The patient's age, unremarkable medical history, and presence of leukocoria (white pupillary reflex) are all consistent with this diagnosis. The mass obscuring the optic nerve head and the surrounding pigmented crescent are also characteristic features of retinoblastoma.

Orbital MRI and brain MRI (choice A) may be necessary later on to assess for optic nerve invasion or metastasis, but they are not the most appropriate next steps in management. Chemotherapy (also part of choice A) is a treatment option for retinoblastoma, but it is not the first-line treatment for all patients, and its use depends on the stage and location of the tumor.

Observation (choice B) is a reasonable first step in management, as it allows for close monitoring of the tumor and assessment of any changes in the patient's symptoms or examination findings. MRI and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the head can provide additional information about the tumor's size, location, and vascularity, which can help guide further management decisions.

Enucleation (choice D) is a surgical procedure that involves removing the affected eye, and it is usually considered a last resort for treating retinoblastoma. It may be necessary if the tumor is large and causing significant vision loss or pain, or if other treatments have been unsuccessful. However, it is not the most appropriate next step in management for this patient, given her young age and the relatively small size of the tumor.

Careful examination of the skin and genetic testing of genes on chromosomes 9 and 16 (choice C) may be appropriate for patients with a family history of retinoblastoma or those with other risk factors, but it is not the most pressing concern for this patient. Retinoblastoma can occur sporadically, without a known family history, and genetic testing may not be necessary for all

**Answer**: C. Nivolumab-induced inflammatory arthritis

The correct answer is C. Nivolumab-induced inflammatory arthritis, as it aligns with the patient's history of metastatic human papillomavirus–positive cervical adenocarcinoma and the initiation of nivolumab therapy 1 year prior to the index visit. The patient's symptoms of joint deformities and partial response to intra-articular steroids also support this diagnosis.

Option A, erosive osteoarthritis, is an incorrect diagnosis as it does not take into account the patient's history of cancer and the recent initiation of nivolumab therapy. While osteoarthritis can cause joint deformities, the presence of multifocal osseous erosions and synovitis on magnetic resonance imaging suggests a more inflammatory condition.

Option B, metastatic bone disease, is also an incorrect diagnosis. Although the patient has a history of metastatic cervical adenocarcinoma, the symptoms and imaging findings do not suggest bone metastases. The patient's joint deformities and synovitis are not typical of metastatic bone disease.

Option D, seronegative rheumatoid arthritis, is an unlikely diagnosis as the patient's symptoms began shortly after initiating nivolumab therapy, and there is no evidence of autoantibodies in the patient's blood. Additionally, the patient's age and lack of morning stiffness also make this diagnosis less likely.

Therefore, option C, Nivolumab-induced inflammatory arthritis, is the most appropriate diagnosis for this patient's symptoms and clinical findings.

**Answer**:C. Perform a laboratory-based HbA1c test to determine the patient’s glycemic status.

The correct answer is C because a laboratory-based HbA1c test is the most appropriate test to determine the patient's glycemic status. HbA1c is a measure of average blood glucose levels over the past 2-3 months and is a reliable indicator of diabetes diagnosis and monitoring. A laboratory-based HbA1c test is more accurate and precise than a point-of-care (POC) test, especially in patients with borderline diabetes or those who are not symptomatic.

Choice A, a laboratory-based glucose test, is not the best option because it only measures current blood glucose levels and may not accurately reflect the patient's long-term glycemic status.

Choice B, a POC HbA1c test via fingerstick, may not be the best option for this patient because it may not be as accurate as a laboratory-based test, and the patient's obesity and hypertension may make it difficult to obtain an adequate fingerstick sample.

Choice D, not performing glycemic testing, is not appropriate because the patient has risk factors for diabetes and has expressed concern about having the disease. It is important to evaluate the patient's glycemic status to determine if he has diabetes or is at risk for developing it.

**Answer**: B. Ichthyosiform mycosis fungoides

The correct answer is B. Ichthyosiform mycosis fungoides because it best matches the patient's symptoms and test results described in the case.

Ichthyosiform mycosis fungoides (IMF) is a rare cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that typically presents with scaly, itchy patches or nodules on the skin, similar to what the patient in the case experienced. The patient's history of a 12-year history of itchy eruptions over the whole body, with multiple nodules appearing on the upper back 1 year previously and gradually increasing in number and size, is consistent with the characteristic presentation of IMF.

The patient's physical examination findings, including extensive, dry scaly patches on the trunk, arms, and legs, and several 0.5- to 1-cm, dome-shaped, red papules and nodules on the upper back, are also consistent with IMF. Additionally, the patient's mildly enlarged lymph nodes in the cervical, axillary, and inguinal regions are a common finding in IMF.

The biopsy results showed small to medium-sized atypical cells and focal areas of epidermotropism, which are consistent with the histopathologic features of IMF. The positive CD4 immunohistochemical analysis result also supports the diagnosis of IMF, as CD4 is a marker of T cells, which are the primary cells involved in this lymphoma.

In contrast, the other answer choices do not match the patient's symptoms and test results as well as IMF does.

A. Cutaneous pseudolymphoma is a rare condition characterized by the development of lymphoid tissue in the skin, leading to the formation of papules, nodules, or plaques. While it can present with scaly patches or nodules, the patient's history of a long-standing, widespread eruption and the presence of atypical cells on biopsy are not typical of cutaneous pseudolymphoma.

**Answer**: B. Annular atrophic lichen planus

The correct answer is B. Annular atrophic lichen planus because it matches the clinical presentation described in the case.

Annular atrophic lichen planus is a rare variant of lichen planus that is characterized by the development of small, round, atrophic patches on the skin. The lesions are typically asymptomatic and may be found on any sun-exposed area of the body. The condition is more common in women than men, and the exact cause is not known.

In this case, the patient presented with 1- to 2-cm slightly erythematous annular atrophic plaques on the inferior medial bilateral breasts, with more involvement of the left breast than the right. The rims of the lesions were raised with slight white scale, and the centers were slightly depressed and wrinkled in appearance. These findings are consistent with the clinical presentation of annular atrophic lichen planus.

The other answer choices do not match the clinical presentation of the patient's condition:

A. Erythema annulare centrifugum is a condition characterized by the development of small, round, erythematous patches on the skin that are typically found on the extremities. The lesions are usually asymptomatic and may be associated with other conditions such as atopic dermatitis or allergic contact dermatitis. The patient's lesions are not consistent with this condition.

C. Porokeratosis is a condition characterized by the development of small, round, atrophic patches on the skin that are typically found on the extremities. The lesions are usually asymptomatic and may be associated with other conditions such as psoriasis or eczema. The patient's lesions are not consistent with this condition.

D. Granuloma annulare is a condition characterized by the development of small, round, firm nodules on the skin that are typically found on the extremities. The lesions are usually asymptomatic and may be associated with other conditions such as tuberculosis or syphilis. The patient's lesions are not consistent with this condition.

**Answer**: C. Glioma

The patient's symptoms of progressive lower extremity weakness, sensory loss, and sphincter dysfunction, along with the MRI findings of a long-segment, expansile T2 hyperintense lesion spanning C5 through T12 and involving greater than two-thirds of the cord diameter, are consistent with a diagnosis of glioma. The patient's history of travel to Yosemite National Park and consumption of nutraceuticals increases the likelihood of a glioma diagnosis, as exposure to certain environmental toxins and certain nutraceuticals have been linked to the development of gliomas.

The patient's normal complete blood cell count, electrolytes, kidney and liver function, B12, and thyrotropin, as well as the absence of oligoclonal bands and benign cytology on lumbar puncture, rule out a diagnosis of postinfectious myelopathy (choice A). The patient's symptoms and MRI findings are not consistent with toxic myelopathy (choice B), as this condition is typically associated with a history of exposure to toxins such as heavy metals or pesticides, and the MRI findings would likely show a more diffuse and symmetrical involvement of the spinal cord.

The patient's age and symptoms are not consistent with a diagnosis of spinal dural arteriovenous fistula (choice D), as this condition typically affects older adults and is characterized by a history of back pain, sensory changes, and motor weakness. The MRI findings would likely show a characteristic "salt and pepper" appearance of the spinal cord, which is not seen in this case.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, medical history, and MRI findings, the most likely diagnosis is glioma.

The correct answer is B. Right and left heart catheterization.

Let's go through each answer choice and explain why it's incorrect or correct:

A. Transesophageal echocardiography: While this test can provide excellent images of cardiac structures, it may not be able to diagnose the cause of the patient's symptoms. The patient's neck fullness and liver enlargement suggest a possible cardiac output insufficiency, which may not be adequately evaluated by transesophageal echocardiography alone. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.

C. Magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement: This test may be able to diagnose any cardiac or vascular abnormalities, but it may not be able to evaluate the hemodynamic significance of the patient's symptoms. Additionally, it may not be able to diagnose any potential cardiac output insufficiency. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.

D. Liver biopsy: While this test may be able to diagnose any liver abnormalities, it is not directly related to the patient's cardiac symptoms. The patient's neck fullness and liver enlargement suggest a possible cardiac output insufficiency, which may not be adequately evaluated by liver biopsy alone. Therefore, this choice is incorrect.

B. Right and left heart catheterization: This test can evaluate the patient's cardiac output, pulmonary artery pressure, and potential shunts or blockages in the coronary arteries. It can also evaluate the patient's response to different interventions, such as vasodilators or inotropes. This test is the most appropriate choice to diagnose the cause of the patient's symptoms and determine the best course of treatment. Therefore, this choice is correct.

In summary, right and left heart catheterization is the most appropriate test to diagnose the cause of the patient's symptoms and determine the best course of treatment. The other choices may not be able to adequately evaluate the patient's cardiac output insufficiency or potential cardiac abnormalities.

**Answer**: A. Perform percutaneous biopsy of the mass

The correct answer is A, Perform percutaneous biopsy of the mass, because it is the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic workup of this patient's breast mass.

Percutaneous biopsy is a minimally invasive procedure that allows for the removal of a small sample of tissue from the mass for further examination. This is the recommended approach in this case because it will provide the most accurate diagnosis with the least amount of risk and discomfort to the patient.

Option B, Excise the mass, is not the best next step because it involves removing the entire mass without first confirming the diagnosis. This could potentially lead to unnecessary surgery and may not provide adequate tissue for diagnosis.

Option C, Order breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may be useful in certain cases, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this particular case. MRI is typically used to further evaluate a breast mass after a biopsy has been performed, rather than as a first-line diagnostic test.

Option D, Send hormonal evaluation for gynecomastia, is not relevant to this case because there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has gynecomastia.

Therefore, the best answer is A, Perform percutaneous biopsy of the mass.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain why C. Multiforme erythema is the correct answer and why the other choices are incorrect.

**Answer**: C. Multiforme erythema

Multiforme erythema is a rare autoimmune disease that affects the skin and mucous membranes. It is characterized by the presence of multiple, variably-sized, round or oval, erythematous lesions on the skin and mucous membranes. The lesions are typically accompanied by a mild to moderate inflammatory response and may be associated with symptoms such as fever, headache, and fatigue.

In the case described, the patient presented with desquamatory lesions on the mucosa of the oral cavity, lips, and penis, as well as hemorrhagic lesions of the eye sclera. These findings are consistent with the skin and mucous membrane lesions seen in multiforme erythema. Additionally, the patient's history of a similar but less severe clinical event 5 years previously, which resolved following treatment with corticosteroids, suggests that the current episode may also be related to an autoimmune response.

The other choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and findings.

A. Bullous pemphigus is a rare autoimmune disease that affects the skin and mucous membranes, causing large, fluid-filled blisters to form. While the patient's desquamatory lesions may resemble the blisters seen in bullous pemphigus, the absence of large, fluid-filled blisters and the presence of hemorrhagic lesions of the eye sclera argue against this diagnosis.

B. Toxic epidermal necrolysis (Lyell syndrome) is a severe, life-threatening condition that is caused by a severe immune response to a drug or other trigger. The patient's symptoms and findings, including the desquamatory lesions and eye sclera hemorrhages, are not consistent with the widespread, severe skin and mucous membrane damage seen in toxic epidermal necrolysis.

**Answer**:C. Papillary adenocarcinoma

The correct answer is C. Papillary adenocarcinoma because it best matches the patient's symptoms and the histopathological features of the tumor.

A. Squamous cell carcinoma is a malignant tumor that arises from squamous epithelial cells, commonly found in the nasopharynx. However, the histopathological features of the tumor, such as the papillary structures with fibrovascular cores and nuclear grooves, do not support this diagnosis.

B. Lymphoma is a malignancy that affects the immune system, primarily originating from lymphoid tissues. The patient's symptoms, such as recurrent epistaxis, and the tumor's location in the nasopharynx, do not suggest lymphoma as the most likely diagnosis.

D. Chondrosarcoma is a malignant tumor that arises from cartilage cells. The patient's symptoms and the tumor's location in the nasopharynx do not support this diagnosis, as chondrosarcoma typically affects the cartilage in the respiratory tract, and the histopathological features of the tumor do not show any evidence of cartilaginous differentiation.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, the tumor's location, and the histopathological features, the most likely diagnosis is C. Papillary adenocarcinoma.

**Answer**:C. Pemphigus vulgaris

The patient's symptoms and test results point to pemphigus vulgaris as the correct diagnosis. Pemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune disease that causes painful blisters and sores on the skin and mucous membranes. The patient's skin and mucous membrane lesions, as well as the positive anti-desmoglein 1 and anti-desmoglein 3 IgG test results, are consistent with this diagnosis.

Squamous cell carcinoma (choice A) is unlikely because the patient's lesions are not characteristic of this condition. Squamous cell carcinoma typically appears as a firm, raised bump on the skin and is not associated with mucous membrane involvement.

Paracoccidioidomycosis (choice B) is a fungal infection that can cause skin and mucous membrane lesions, but it is not associated with autoantibody production or positive anti-desmoglein test results.

Lupus vulgaris (choice D) is a form of cutaneous tuberculosis that can cause skin lesions, but it is not associated with mucous membrane involvement or positive anti-desmoglein test results.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and test results, the correct diagnosis is pemphigus vulgaris.

**Answer**:C. Eosinophilic sialodochitis

The correct answer is C. Eosinophilic sialodochitis.

Eosinophilic sialodochitis is a rare condition characterized by the inflammation of the salivary ducts, particularly the Wharton's duct, which is the main duct that drains saliva from the submandibular gland. The inflammation is caused by an abnormal accumulation of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, in the duct. This condition is often associated with allergic reactions, and symptoms include swelling and pain in the submandibular gland, difficulty swallowing, and sometimes fever.

In the given case, the patient presented with recurring left submandibular gland swelling and pain, which is a common symptom of eosinophilic sialodochitis. The patient's medical history, including allergic rhinitis, also supports this diagnosis. The histological slide of the cast showing numerous eosinophils, which are characteristic of eosinophilic sialodochitis, further supports this diagnosis.

Now, let's discuss why the other answer choices are incorrect:

A. IgG4-related sialadenitis: IgG4-related sialadenitis is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the salivary glands, particularly the submandibular gland. It is characterized by the infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells into the gland, leading to inflammation and obstruction of the salivary ducts. While IgG4-related sialadenitis can present with similar symptoms to eosinophilic sialodochitis, such as swelling and pain in the submandibular gland, it is a distinct condition with a different underlying cause.

B. Kimura disease: Kimura disease is a rare condition characterized by the proliferation of lymphatic vessels, leading to the formation of masses in the head and neck, including the submandibular gland. While Kimura disease can present with swelling and pain in the submandibular gland, it is a distinct condition

**Answer**:B. Start topical and systemic antifungal treatment

Explanation:

A. Start a broad-spectrum oral antibiotic such as moxifloxacin:
This choice is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and signs suggest a fungal infection, rather than a bacterial infection. While broad-spectrum antibiotics can cover a wide range of bacterial pathogens, they are ineffective against fungal infections. Therefore, starting a broad-spectrum oral antibiotic would not be the appropriate next step in managing this patient's condition.

C. Restart topical steroid drops:
This choice is incorrect because topical steroids are not effective against fungal infections and may even exacerbate the condition by suppressing the immune response. The patient's current symptoms and signs suggest an active infection, and restarting topical steroids would not address the underlying infection.

D. Bring the patient to the operating room urgently and remove and send the DSAEK graft for microbiological culture and sensitivity:
This choice is incorrect because it is not necessary to remove the graft at this point. The patient's symptoms and signs suggest a fungal infection that can be treated with antifungal medication. Removing the graft would not address the underlying infection and may lead to unnecessary complications.

B. Start topical and systemic antifungal treatment:
This choice is correct because the patient's symptoms and signs suggest a fungal infection. Topical and systemic antifungal treatment can effectively manage fungal infections and prevent further complications. The crisscross pattern of the graft-host interface haze and the negative microbiological results suggest a fungal infection, and starting antifungal treatment would be the appropriate next step in managing this patient's condition.

**Answer**:C. Interferon-γ release assay

The correct answer is C. Interferon-γ release assay, as it is the most appropriate diagnostic test to order next for this patient.

The patient's symptoms of gradual decline in vision bilaterally over the past 2 years, along with the physical examination findings of scattered subretinal lesions in the right eye and a few pigmented anterior vitreous cells, suggest the possibility of a chronic inflammatory condition affecting the retina. The patient's history of immigration from Mexico and lack of known ocular or medical history also increase the likelihood of a rare or infectious condition.

An interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) is a diagnostic test that measures the presence of certain proteins in the blood that are produced in response to specific infections. It is commonly used to diagnose diseases such as tuberculosis, which can cause uveitis and chorioretinal lesions similar to those described in the patient's case. The IGRA test can help identify whether the patient has an underlying infection that may be contributing to the observed retinal lesions.

In contrast, human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotyping (option A) is a test used to identify genetic variations in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes, which play a critical role in the immune system. While HLA haplotyping may be relevant in certain ocular inflammatory conditions, it is not the most appropriate test to order next for this patient given the absence of any known ocular or medical history and the patient's recent immigration from Mexico.

Empirical steroids (option B) may be considered as a treatment option for certain inflammatory conditions affecting the retina, but it is not the most appropriate next step in the patient's management. Steroids can have significant side effects, and their use should be guided by the results of diagnostic tests and a thorough clinical evaluation.

Observation (option D) may be appropriate for certain patients with mild or stable retinal lesions, but it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient given the gradual decline in vision and the presence of numerous chor

D. Provide patient education and observation is the correct answer because the patient's symptoms and examination results do not indicate a clear cause for his acute vision loss. The patient's history of hypertension and asthma may be relevant to his overall health and potential treatment plan, but they do not necessarily explain his acute vision loss.

The patient's visual acuity has worsened rapidly, and his intraocular pressure is elevated, which could indicate a number of possible causes, including angle-closure glaucoma, uveitis, or a posterior segment condition. However, the absence of any masses or abnormalities on ultrasonography suggests that the cause of his vision loss is more likely to be related to the anterior segment.

Performing a peripheral iridotomy (choice A) may be a treatment option for angle-closure glaucoma, but it is not appropriate in this case because there is no evidence of angle closure. Ordering magnetic resonance imaging (choice B) may be appropriate to rule out any intracranial causes of vision loss, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. Performing a clear lens extraction (choice C) is not indicated in this case because the patient's visual acuity has worsened rapidly, and there is no evidence of a cataract.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to provide patient education and observation (choice D). The patient should be educated about the possible causes of his vision loss and the need for further evaluation and monitoring to determine the underlying cause. The patient should be advised to follow up with his ophthalmologist regularly to monitor his visual acuity and intraocular pressure, and to seek immediate medical attention if his symptoms worsen or if he experiences any new symptoms.

**Answer**:C. Magnetic resonance imaging of orbits

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as a bulging left eye, frequent ipsilateral tearing, and limited abduction and supraduction, suggest the possibility of an orbital tumor or mass. The patient's history of melanoma in the right temple also raises the concern of a metastatic lesion in the left eye.

Option C, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits, is the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation. MRI is a non-invasive imaging modality that can provide high-resolution images of the orbits and can help to identify any intraorbital masses or tumors. MRI can also help to evaluate the extent of any potential tumor and its relationship to surrounding structures, such as the optic nerve and extraocular muscles.

Option A, applanation tonometry, is not the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation. Although applanation tonometry can be used to assess the intraocular pressure, it does not provide any information about the orbital structures or potential tumors.

Option B, serum thyroid testing, is also not the most appropriate next step. Although thyroid dysfunction can cause changes in the eye, such as proptosis or lid retraction, there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has a thyroid disorder.

Option D, computed angiography of the head, may be considered in the evaluation of certain orbital tumors, such as a suspected hemangioma or arteriovenous malformation. However, in the absence of any specific symptoms or findings suggestive of these conditions, MRI is a more appropriate initial imaging modality.

**Answer**: D. Myasthenia gravis and myositis syndrome

The patient's symptoms of diplopia, myalgia, and abnormal muscle strength are consistent with a myasthenia gravis and myositis syndrome. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder that affects the nerve-muscle connection, leading to muscle weakness and fatigue. Myositis is an inflammatory condition that affects the muscles, leading to muscle weakness, pain, and swelling. The patient's elevated creatine kinase and aldolase levels, as well as the abnormal single-fiber electromyography results, support the diagnosis of myositis. The patient's myasthenia gravis is likely caused by the presence of acetylcholine receptor binding and modulating antibodies, which are autoantibodies that target the nerve-muscle connection.

Guillain-Barré syndrome, which is an autoimmune disorder that affects the peripheral nervous system, may present with similar symptoms such as muscle weakness and diplopia. However, Guillain-Barré syndrome typically presents with a rapid progression of muscle weakness, areflexia, and sensory loss, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms. Additionally, the patient's elevated creatine kinase and aldolase levels and abnormal single-fiber electromyography results do not support the diagnosis of Guillain-Barré syndrome.

Lambert-Eaton syndrome is an autoimmune disorder that affects the nerve-muscle connection and may present with similar symptoms such as muscle weakness and myalgia. However, Lambert-Eaton syndrome typically presents with a slower progression of symptoms, and the patient's elevated creatine kinase and aldolase levels and abnormal single-fiber electromyography results do not support the diagnosis of Lambert-Eaton syndrome.

Miller Fisher syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the nerve-muscle connection and may present with similar symptoms such as muscle weakness, myalgia, and

**Answer**:C. Obtain MRI of the head and orbits

Explanation:

A. Initiate high-dose intravenous corticosteroid medication:
This choice is incorrect because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a typical corticosteroid-responsive condition, such as optic neuritis or uveitis. Additionally, corticosteroids may worsen the patient's cancer, and their use in this case would not address the underlying cause of the vision loss.

B. Inject intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) into both eyes:
This choice is incorrect because while anti-VEGF therapy is commonly used to treat age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy, it is not typically used to treat vision loss due to metastatic breast cancer. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a more systemic issue, rather than a localized retinal problem.

D. Stop capecitabine and trastuzumab:
This choice is incorrect because the patient's vision loss is not necessarily related to the cancer treatment. Cancer treatment-related eye toxicity is rare with capecitabine and trastuzumab, and it is unlikely that stopping the medications would improve the patient's vision. Moreover, stopping the cancer treatment could potentially compromise the patient's oncologic outcome.

C. Obtain MRI of the head and orbits:
This choice is correct because it would help to identify the underlying cause of the patient's vision loss. MRI can help to evaluate the brain and orbit for any metastatic disease, which could be causing the patient's symptoms. It is important to rule out any intracranial or orbital metastatic disease, which could be causing the vision loss, before considering other potential causes such as a retinal detachment or a stroke.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Obtain MRI of the head and orbits.

The correct answer is C: The patient has both iron and vitamin B12 deficiencies.

Let's go through each answer choice and explain why it's incorrect or correct:

A: This patient has iron deficiency anemia in the setting of polycystic ovarian syndrome.

This choice is incorrect because while the patient does have iron deficiency anemia, it's not the only deficiency present. The patient also has vitamin B12 deficiency, as evidenced by the low serum vitamin B12 level. Additionally, there's no mention of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) in the patient's history.

B: This patient has B12 deficiency.

This choice is incorrect because while the patient does have vitamin B12 deficiency, they also have iron deficiency anemia. The patient's low serum iron and low transferrin saturation indicate iron deficiency, and the low vitamin B12 level suggests a deficiency in that nutrient as well.

D: The patient has anemia of chronic disease.

This choice is incorrect because anemia of chronic disease (ACD) is a type of anemia that occurs in people with chronic diseases, such as cancer, HIV/AIDS, and rheumatoid arthritis. While the patient does have a history of obstructive sleep apnea and depression, there's no evidence to suggest that they have a chronic disease that could be causing their anemia. Additionally, ACD is typically associated with a normocytic or macrocytic anemia, whereas the patient's anemia is microcytic, suggesting iron deficiency.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: The patient has both iron and vitamin B12 deficiencies. This answer choice accurately reflects the patient's diagnosis, as they have both iron deficiency anemia and vitamin B12 deficiency.

**Answer**: D. Cutaneous metastatic mucinous carcinoma from rectal carcinoma

The patient's history of rectal carcinoma with lymph node metastasis and recent development of painful skin eruptions on the vulva, as well as the physical examination findings of well-defined, firm, indurated plaques on the vulva with nodules on the surface, are all consistent with cutaneous metastatic mucinous carcinoma from rectal carcinoma. The biopsy results (Figure 1B and C) also support this diagnosis, as they show features of mucinous adenocarcinoma, which is a type of cancer that can originate in the rectum and spread to other parts of the body, including the skin.

In contrast, primary mucinous adenocarcinoma (choice A) would not be expected to have a history of rectal carcinoma, and would more likely present as a primary vulvar lesion. Invasive extramammary Paget disease (choice B) typically presents with itching, scaling, and crusting of the skin, rather than the painful, indurated plaques described in this case. Vulvar Crohn disease (choice C) is a chronic inflammatory condition that can cause skin thickening and nodules, but would not be expected to have the same histopathologic features as mucinous adenocarcinoma.

D. Fibrous cephalic plaque is the correct answer because it matches the clinical presentation and histopathological features described in the case.

A. Sclerotic neurofibroma is an incorrect choice because it is a benign tumor that affects the nervous system, usually occurring in the skin, subcutaneous tissue, or peripheral nerves. It is characterized by a sclerotic appearance, with a dense, fibrous stroma and a lack of significant cellularity. While it can have a similar appearance to the firm plaque described in the case, it is not typically associated with the superimposed papules or the histopathological features described.

B. Familial cutaneous collagenoma is an incorrect choice because it is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple collagenous tumors on the skin, usually appearing as firm, skin-colored nodules. While it can have a similar appearance to the firm plaque described in the case, it is not typically associated with the superimposed papules or the histopathological features described.

C. Shagreen patch is an incorrect choice because it is a rare, benign growth that appears as a firm, rough, irregularly shaped patch on the skin, usually on the scalp or face. It is characterized by a thickened, irregular epidermis and an abundance of dermal collagen. While it can have a similar appearance to the firm plaque described in the case, it is not typically associated with the superimposed papules or the histopathological features described.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Fibrous cephalic plaque, which matches the clinical presentation and histopathological features described in the case.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

**Answer**: C. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, atrophic variant

The correct answer is C. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, atrophic variant, because it best matches the patient's symptoms and test results described in the case.

Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a rare type of skin cancer that grows slowly and can infiltrate surrounding tissue. The atrophic variant is a type of DFSP that is characterized by a lack of significant tumor bulk, and instead, there is a diffuse infiltrate of spindle cells in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue.

The patient's symptoms, such as numerous atrophic papules and plaques on the trunk and extremities, and the associated pain, are consistent with DFSP. The buttonhole sign, which is a characteristic feature of DFSP, is also present in the patient's lesions.

The histopathology results show a poorly circumscribed hypercellular proliferation of spindle cells occupying the lower reticular dermis with lacelike infiltration of the subcutaneous fat. This is consistent with the infiltrative growth pattern of DFSP. The uniform appearing spindle cells with mildly hyperchromatic, elongated, wavy nuclei surrounded by pale cytoplasm are also characteristic of DFSP.

The other answer choices do not match the patient's symptoms and test results as well as DFSP.

A. Neurofibroma is a benign tumor of the nerve sheath that usually grows slowly and can cause skin changes, such as a nodule or a plaque. However, it does not typically cause the diffuse infiltrate of spindle cells in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue that is seen in DFSP.

B. Anetoderma is a rare condition characterized by the development of multiple, small, soft, skin-colored papules on the trunk and extremities. It is not associated with the buttonhole sign or the infiltrative growth pattern of DFSP.

**Answer**:A. Autoimmune Isaacs syndrome

Autoimmune Isaacs syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by the presence of anti-Hu antibodies, which target the neuronal protein HuD. The clinical presentation of Autoimmune Isaacs syndrome includes a combination of neurological symptoms such as muscle twitching, cramps, and weakness, as well as skin manifestations like psoriasis. The patient's history of psoriasis and the presence of purple striae on the abdomen and calves are consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's symptoms of muscle twitching and weakness are also consistent with Autoimmune Isaacs syndrome.

Morvan syndrome, which is associated with autoantibodies against voltage-gated potassium channels, can also present with muscle twitching and weakness, but it is less likely in this case because the patient does not have a history of cardiac arrhythmias or ocular abnormalities, which are commonly seen in Morvan syndrome.

Rippling muscle disease, also known as IBM2, is a rare genetic disorder that affects the muscles and can cause muscle twitching and weakness. However, it is unlikely in this case because the patient does not have a family history of the disorder, and the age of onset is typically earlier than 42 years.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurological disorder that affects the motor neurons and can cause muscle twitching, cramps, and weakness. However, ALS typically presents with a history of progressive weakness over months or years, and the patient's symptoms are not consistent with this diagnosis.

Therefore, based on the patient's history of psoriasis, the presence of purple striae, and the symptoms of muscle twitching and weakness, Autoimmune Isaacs syndrome is the most likely diagnosis.

**Answer**:A. Start corticosteroid therapy

The patient in this case has a history of vasospastic angina (VA), which is a condition characterized by sudden, severe spasms of the coronary arteries, leading to decreased blood flow to the heart muscle and potentially life-threatening cardiac events. The patient has already experienced multiple episodes of cardiac arrest and asystole, and her ejection fraction has declined to 30%.

The correct answer, A. Start corticosteroid therapy, is chosen because corticosteroids are a class of medications that have been shown to be effective in reducing the frequency and severity of vasospastic angina episodes. Corticosteroids work by reducing inflammation and relaxing blood vessels, which can help to prevent the spasms that occur in VA. In this case, starting corticosteroid therapy could help to prevent further cardiac events and potentially improve the patient's ejection fraction.

The other answer choices are not correct for the following reasons:

B. Reprogram the ICD: While an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) can be an effective tool in preventing sudden cardiac death in patients with VA, it is not the most appropriate choice in this case. The patient's ICD has already failed to deliver a shock during a previous cardiac arrest, and reprogramming the device is unlikely to address the underlying cause of the patient's vasospastic angina.

C. Surgical revascularization: Surgical revascularization, such as coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), may be a viable option for some patients with VA, but it is not the most appropriate choice in this case. The patient's vasospastic angina is caused by spasms in the coronary arteries, rather than a blockage, and surgical revascularization is unlikely to address the underlying cause of the spasms.

D. Percutaneous revascularization: Percutaneous revascularization, such as angioplasty or stenting, may also be a viable option for some patients with VA, but it is not the most appropriate choice in this case. Like surgical revascularization,

**Answer**: B. Chordoma

The correct answer is B. Chordoma because it best matches the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.

A. Lipoma is a benign tumor made up of fat cells, usually slow-growing and painless. It is not typically found in the sphenoid sinus and would not explain the patient's symptoms of facial trauma and neurological deficits.

C. Ecchordosis physalsiphora is a rare, benign tumor that originates from the notochordal remnants in the sphenoid sinus. However, it typically presents with symptoms of nasal congestion, headaches, and proptosis (bulging eye), which are not mentioned in the patient's history. Additionally, the imaging findings of a multilobulated mass with heterogeneous enhancement do not match the typical appearance of ecchordosis physalsiphora on MRI.

D. Chondrosarcoma is a malignant tumor that arises from cartilage cells. It can occur in the sphenoid sinus, but it is rare. The patient's symptoms and imaging findings are consistent with a chordoma, which is a type of chondrosarcoma that arises from the notochordal remnants in the sphenoid sinus. The patient's age and the location of the tumor also match the typical demographics and characteristics of chordoma patients.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, imaging findings, and demographics, the most likely diagnosis is B. Chordoma.

**Answer**: C. NUT carcinoma

NUT carcinoma, also known as nasopharyngeal carcinoma, is a type of cancer that originates in the nasopharynx, which is the upper part of the throat behind the nose. It is a rare type of cancer, but it is a common type of cancer in certain parts of the world, such as China and Southeast Asia.

The patient's symptoms, such as epiphora, headache, and facial pressure, are consistent with NUT carcinoma. The patient's age and the location of the tumor, which involves the left medial canthus and extends through the nasolacrimal duct into the left nasal cavity, are also consistent with NUT carcinoma.

The immunohistochemical (IHC) staining results, which showed positivity for cytokeratin 5/6 and p63, and negativity for Epstein-Barr virus, p16, CD45 (leukocyte common antigen), and synaptophysin, are also consistent with NUT carcinoma.

The patient's treatment, which involved left medial maxillectomy via lateral rhinotomy approach, with resection of residual tumor, is also consistent with the treatment for NUT carcinoma.

The other answer choices are not consistent with the patient's symptoms, location of the tumor, and treatment.

A. Olfactory neuroblastoma is a rare type of cancer that originates in the olfactory epithelium, which is the lining of the nasal cavity. It is not consistent with the patient's symptoms or the location of the tumor.

**Answer**: B. X-linked deafness 2

X-linked deafness 2 is the correct answer because it matches the patient's symptoms and family history. The patient's symptoms of hearing loss, restricted middle ear mobility, and bilateral moderately severe mixed hearing loss rising to normal hearing sensitivity in both ears are consistent with X-linked deafness 2. Additionally, the family history of childhood hearing loss in the patient's maternal grandfather also supports this diagnosis.

X-linked deafness 2 is caused by mutations in the POU3F4 gene, which is located on the X chromosome. This gene plays a crucial role in the development and maintenance of the inner ear and auditory nerve. Mutations in the POU3F4 gene can lead to hearing loss, which is usually severe to profound and affects both ears.

The other answer choices do not match the patient's symptoms and family history:

A. Branchio-oto-renal syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of the branchial arches, inner ear, and kidneys. It is not associated with X-linked inheritance or hearing loss.

C. Usher syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the inner ear and retina. It is characterized by hearing loss, vestibular dysfunction, and progressive visual loss. While it can have a similar presentation to X-linked deafness 2, it is not associated with mutations in the POU3F4 gene.

D. Pendred syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the thyroid gland and the inner ear. It is characterized by thyroid dysfunction and hearing loss, but it is not associated with X-linked inheritance or the specific symptoms described in the case.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and family history, the most likely diagnosis is X-linked deafness 2.

**Answer**: D. Obtain biopsy results

Explanation:
The patient's bilateral orbital masses, as shown in the provided MRI images, must be thoroughly examined to establish their nature and purpose. A biopsy is the best approach to achieve this. It will provide tissue samples for histopathological analysis, aiding in the diagnosis and management of the patient's condition.

Option A, obtaining thyroid function test results or endocrine evaluation results, may be relevant for evaluating the patient's overall endocrine health. However, it is not directly related to the patient's orbital masses and does not provide the necessary information for their diagnosis.

Option B, obtaining Doppler ultrasonography results with and without Valsalva, is not the most appropriate step. Although it may provide information about blood flow and potential vascular abnormalities, it does not directly address the patient's orbital masses.

Option C, chest computed tomography, is not relevant to the patient's current symptoms and findings. It may be necessary in specific cases, but it is not the next step in this scenario.

Therefore, the best course of action is to obtain biopsy results to determine the nature of the patient's bilateral orbital masses.

**Answer**:B. Order magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and a medical genetics evaluation

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, including a visual acuity of 20/125 OD and 20/20 OS, severely diminished color vision in the right eye, and no detectable stereoacuity, suggest a possible diagnosis of a pigmented macular lesion. The patient's history of an Escherichia coli infection complicated by hemolytic uremic syndrome increases the likelihood of this diagnosis.

Option A, referring the patient for consideration of plaque brachytherapy or enucleation of the right eye, is not the next best step. These treatments are typically considered for more advanced stages of eye cancer, and the patient's symptoms do not suggest that they are at this stage.

Option C, starting oral corticosteroids, may be a consideration for uveitis or other inflammatory conditions, but it is not directly related to the patient's symptoms or possible diagnosis.

Option D, performing a vitreous tap and injecting with antivirals, may be a consideration for viral retinitis or other retinal infections, but it is not directly related to the patient's symptoms or possible diagnosis.

Therefore, the next best step would be to order magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and a medical genetics evaluation to further investigate the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and to rule out other potential diagnoses. This will help guide further management and treatment decisions.

**Answer**: B. Surgery to create scleral windows

The patient in the case presented with intermittent temporal visual field loss, floaters, and headaches, which suggests a possible retinal detachment. The bilateral eye examination revealed a left retinal detachment extending from 1:30 to 10:00 o’clock, with macular involvement, and 360° left choroidal detachments. Optical coherence tomography showed choroidal thickening in both maculae. These findings indicate that the patient has a retinal detachment and choroidal effusion, which can cause vision loss if left untreated.

The correct answer, B. Surgery to create scleral windows, is the best option to treat the patient's condition. Scleral windows are small incisions made in the sclera, the white part of the eye, to allow the surgeon to access the underlying retina and choroid. This surgery can help to reattach the retina and remove any fluid or blood that may have accumulated underneath it, thus improving the patient's vision.

The other answer choices are not appropriate for the patient's condition:

A. Diagnostic vitrectomy with cytologic testing: This procedure involves removing a small sample of vitreous gel and cells from the eye to examine for inflammatory or infectious causes of retinal detachment. While it may be useful in some cases, it is not the best option for this patient since the diagnosis of retinal detachment and choroidal effusion has already been made, and there is no indication of an inflammatory or infectious cause.

C. Surgery to create a scleral buckle: A scleral buckle is a device that is placed under the retina to push it back into place and reattach it. This procedure is typically used for retinal detachments that are caused by a tear or hole in the retina. In this case, the patient's retinal detachment is not caused by a tear or hole, but rather by choroidal effusion, making a scleral buckle less effective.

**Answer**: C. Intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor injections and laser panretinal photocoagulation

The patient in the case presented has a significant loss of visual acuity in the left eye, with a hemoglobin A1c level of 11.0%, indicating poor compliance with diabetic treatment. The examination reveals retinal thickening, capillary nonperfusion, and disc neovascularization with leakage, as well as cystoid abnormalities and subretinal fluid on optical coherence tomography.

Option A, laser panretinal photocoagulation, is incorrect because it is not the most appropriate treatment for the patient's severe macular edema and disc neovascularization. While laser photocoagulation can be used to treat diabetic retinopathy, it is primarily used for peripheral retinal lesions and may not effectively address the macular edema and disc neovascularization in this case.

Option B, intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor injections, is also incorrect. While anti-VEGF injections can be used to treat diabetic macular edema, they are not the most appropriate treatment for the patient's severe disc neovascularization and retinal nonperfusion.

Option D, pars plana vitrectomy with endolaser, is also incorrect. Vitrectomy is a surgical procedure that may be considered for advanced diabetic retinopathy with severe vitreous hemorrhage or tractional retinal detachment. However, it is not the most appropriate treatment for the patient's current condition, which primarily involves macular edema and disc neovascularization.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C, a combination of intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor injections and laser panretinal photocoagulation. This combination can effectively address the patient's severe macular edema, disc neovascularization, and retinal nonperfusion, and is a more comprehensive approach to treating the patient's diabetic retinopathy. The anti-VEGF injections can help reduce the macular edema and prevent

**Answer**:A. Observe

The patient presents with bilateral blurry vision occurring 2 hours after a car crash. The patient was wearing a seatbelt, and the airbag deployed, causing an intense flexion-extension head movement. The patient's visual acuity is 20/125 OD and 20/63 OS, and intraocular pressure is 19 mm Hg OD and 20 mm Hg OS. Slitlamp examination reveals no palpebral hematoma, and the anterior segment is normal. On the fundus bilaterally, there is an alteration of the foveal reflection, with neither retinae commotio nor hemorrhages. Macular optical coherence tomography (OCT) shows bilateral macular edema with cystoid abnormalities.

Given the patient's history and examination findings, the most appropriate next step would be to observe the patient. The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with a possible diagnosis of bilateral macular edema with cystoid abnormalities, which can be caused by various factors, including trauma. However, the patient's recent history of a car crash and the absence of any other ocular injuries suggest that the macular edema may be related to the head movement caused by the airbag deployment.

Observing the patient would allow for close monitoring of the macular edema and any potential changes in the patient's vision. If the edema does not improve or worsens over time, further diagnostic testing or treatment may be necessary.

The other options are not the most appropriate next steps for the following reasons:

B. Systemic or bilateral intraocular corticosteroid therapy: Corticosteroids may be used to treat macular edema, but they are not the first line of treatment for this condition. In this case, the patient's macular edema is likely related to the recent trauma, and corticosteroids may not address the underlying cause.

**Answer**: C. Merkel cell carcinoma

The patient's symptoms and the skin punch biopsy results suggest Merkel cell carcinoma. The patient had a 30 cm-wide, easily bleeding, violaceous, cutaneous lesion on the left scapular region, with a superinfected necrotic central portion surrounded by satellite telangiectatic papules. The patient also reported decreased appetite, weight loss, and intense and continuous pain from the lesion. These symptoms are consistent with Merkel cell carcinoma, a rare and aggressive type of skin cancer that typically affects the elderly and is known for its high metastatic potential.

The skin punch biopsy results also support this diagnosis. Merkel cell carcinoma typically has a characteristic histopathological appearance, with a proliferation of small, round, blue cells with finely granular chromatin, which is consistent with the hematoxylin-eosin stain image provided (Figure, C). Additionally, the presence of a left adrenal gland mass consistent with adenoma, and enlarged supraclavicular and cervical lymph nodes, suggests a possible association with Merkel cell carcinoma.

The other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and biopsy results. Cutaneous metastasis from small cell lung cancer (Answer A) is unlikely given the patient's age and the absence of any history of lung cancer. Loxoscelism (Answer B) is a rare condition caused by the bite of a brown recluse spider, which is not common in the patient's location. Primary cutaneous lymphoma (Sézary syndrome) (Answer D) is a type of cancer that affects the skin and can cause skin lesions, but it typically presents with more widespread skin involvement and lymphadenopathy, which is not consistent with the patient's presentation.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is B: Review the ECG for features of atrial fibrillation.

Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is a type of arrhythmia characterized by a rapid and irregular heartbeat. The ECG in Figure 1 shows several features consistent with AFib, including:

* Irregular rhythm: The R-R intervals are variable and do not follow a regular pattern, indicating an irregular heartbeat.
* Fibrillation waves: There are irregular, wavy lines on the ECG that represent the abnormal electrical activity in the atria.
* No P waves: In AFib, the P waves are often absent or difficult to identify, as the atria are not functioning properly.
* Rapid ventricular response: The ventricles are responding to the atrial fibrillation by beating rapidly, resulting in a rapid heart rate.

Given these features, choice B is the correct answer.

Now, let's discuss why the other choices are incorrect:

A: Review the ECG for frequent atrial ectopic beats. While atrial ectopic beats can be a sign of AFib, they are not a definitive diagnostic feature. The ECG in Figure 1 does not show any obvious atrial ectopic beats.

C: Review the ECG for atrial flutter with varying AV block. Atrial flutter is a type of arrhythmia characterized by a regular, rapid heartbeat. While atrial flutter can have varying AV block, the ECG in Figure 1 does not show any evidence of atrial flutter.

D: Review the ECG for features of multifocal atrial tachycardia. Multifocal atrial tachycardia is a type of arrhythmia characterized by rapid, irregular heartbeats originating from multiple sites in the atria. While the ECG in Figure 1 does show some irregularity in the heartbeat, it does not have the characteristic features of multifocal atrial tachycardia.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: Review the ECG for features of atrial fibrillation.

**Answer**:B. Assess serum α1-antitrypsin level and genotype

The correct answer is B. Assess serum α1-antitrypsin level and genotype, because the patient's history of tobacco use and symptoms of progressive cough and dyspnea suggest the possibility of alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency, a genetic disorder that can lead to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and bronchiectasis. AAT is a protease inhibitor that protects the lung tissue from proteolytic damage caused by neutrophil elastase, and deficiency in AAT can lead to uncontrolled proteolytic damage and lung tissue destruction. The patient's low FEV1 and FVC, and the presence of bronchiectasis on CT scan, are consistent with AAT deficiency.

Assessing serum α1-antitrypsin level and genotype can help confirm the diagnosis of AAT deficiency and guide further management. If the patient has a low serum AAT level or a genotype associated with AAT deficiency, it may be necessary to initiate augmentation therapy with intravenous AAT, which has been shown to slow the progression of lung disease in patients with AAT deficiency.

The other options are not as appropriate for several reasons:

A. Order bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsy: While bronchoscopy may be necessary to evaluate the patient's lung disease further, it is not the most appropriate next step. The patient's symptoms and radiologic findings are consistent with AAT deficiency, and assessing serum AAT level and genotype can help confirm the diagnosis without the need for invasive procedures.

C. Order inhaled nasal nitric oxide and ciliary dyskinesia genetic testing: Inhaled nasal nitric oxide and ciliary dyskinesia genetic testing may be appropriate for patients with primary ciliary dyskinesia, but they are not relevant to the patient's symptoms and radiologic findings, which suggest AAT def

**Answer**:A. Mycosis fungoides

Mycosis fungoides (MF) is a rare cutaneous T-cell lymphoma characterized by the presence of malignant T cells that resemble mycosis fungoides. The condition typically presents with patches or plaques on the skin, which can progress to tumors and eventually spread to other parts of the body.

The patient's history of mildly pruritic poikilodermatous patches and thin plaques involving the bilateral axilla and groin for 5 years, with expanding lesions on both flanks, is consistent with the diagnosis of MF. The physical examination findings of hypopigmented and hyperpigmented reticulated patches and thin, atrophic plaques covering more than 10% of the total body surface area, involving the axilla, groin, and flanks bilaterally, are also consistent with MF.

The histopathological examination of the punch biopsy specimen showed features consistent with MF, including a dense infiltrate of atypical lymphocytes in the dermis, and the immunohistochemical analysis showed positivity for CD4 and CD79a, which are markers of T cells. These findings support the diagnosis of MF.

In contrast, large-plaque parapsoriasis is a rare variant of psoriasis that is characterized by large, scaly plaques on the skin. Cutaneous amyloidosis is a condition in which abnormal proteins accumulate in the skin, leading to the formation of firm, yellowish deposits. Dowling-Degos disease is a rare genetic disorder that affects the skin and causes the formation of small, dark spots on the skin. None of these conditions match the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, and therefore, they are not the correct diagnoses.

Therefore, the correct answer is A. Mycosis fungoides.

The correct answer is D: Intralymphatic histiocytosis.

Intralymphatic histiocytosis is a rare condition characterized by the infiltration of histiocytes into the lymphatic vessels. The patient's symptoms of an irregularly linear, rusty-brown, atrophic, streaklike plaque extending from the tip of his right shoulder to the right biceps, with scattered, slightly indurated, irregular papules within it, and the absence of warmth, thrills, or pulsations across the affected area, are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's history of easy bruising also supports this diagnosis, as intralymphatic histiocytosis can cause bruising and bleeding due to the infiltration of histiocytes into the lymphatic vessels.

The punch biopsy results also support this diagnosis, as they show a dermal infiltrate arranged in nodules with clefting between nodules, and some inflammatory aggregates within dilated vessels. The immunohistochemical staining for CD68 antigen, which reveals that the infiltrate is composed mostly of histiocytes, further supports the diagnosis of intralymphatic histiocytosis.

The other answer choices are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and medical history.

A: Linear morphea is a condition characterized by the formation of linear or streaklike lesions on the skin, often with a wavy or zigzag pattern. While the patient's lesion does have a linear appearance, it does not have the characteristic wavy or zigzag pattern of linear morphea. Additionally, linear morphea is typically associated with inflammation and scaling, which are not features of the patient's lesion.

B: Serpentine supravenous hyperpigmentation is a condition characterized by the formation of serpentine or wavy lines of hyperpigmentation on the skin, often in a distribution that follows the course of underlying veins.

**Answer**: B. Diffuse melanosis cutis

The patient's symptoms of painless, nonpruritic, diffuse dark gray skin, nail beds, and eye discoloration are consistent with diffuse melanosis cutis. This condition is characterized by the accumulation of melanin in the skin, leading to a darkening of the skin, nails, and eyes. The patient's history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and treatment with pembrolizumab may have contributed to the development of this condition.

**A**: Hemochromatosis is a condition in which the body absorbs too much iron from food and stores it in the liver, heart, and other organs. While it can cause skin darkening, it is not typically associated with diffuse melanosis cutis. Therefore, choice A is incorrect.

**C**: Addison disease is a condition in which the adrenal glands do not produce enough cortisol and aldosterone hormones. While it can cause skin darkening, it is not typically associated with diffuse melanosis cutis. Therefore, choice C is incorrect.

**D**: Hyperpigmentation due to sun exposure is a common condition that occurs when the skin is exposed to UV radiation. However, the patient's symptoms of diffuse dark gray skin, nail beds, and eye discoloration are not consistent with this condition. Therefore, choice D is incorrect.

In summary, based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, the most likely diagnosis is diffuse melanosis cutis, which is correctly answered as choice B.

**Answer**:B. Subcutaneous ICD reprogramming and observation

The patient in this case has a subcutaneous implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (S-ICD) that has delivered several shocks during the early morning hours, waking her up from sleeping. The device interrogation showed shock therapies delivered post-implant on days 3, 5, 6, and 10. The surface electrogram recorded by the S-ICD showed a rapid ventricular rhythm with a narrow QRS complex, consistent with ventricular tachycardia (VT).

Given the patient's history of dilated cardiomyopathy and the recent shocks delivered by the S-ICD, it is likely that the patient is experiencing recurrent VT, which is not effectively controlled by the current device settings.

Option A, administering anticoagulation and increasing the dose of the β-blocker, may be appropriate for patients with atrial fibrillation or other conditions where anticoagulation is indicated, but it is not directly related to the patient's current problem of recurrent VT.

Option C, administering a loading dose of amiodarone, may be effective in converting VT to sinus rhythm, but it is not a long-term solution and may not address the underlying cause of the arrhythmia.

Option D, referring the patient for catheter ablation, may be a consideration for patients with refractory VT, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as the patient has a recently implanted S-ICD and the focus should be on optimizing the device settings to effectively manage the arrhythmia.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B, subcutaneous ICD reprogramming and observation. This approach allows for adjusting the device settings to better manage the patient's VT and observing the patient's response to the new settings before considering other options.

**Answer**: B. Schwannoma with a traumatic ulcerative granuloma with stromal eosinophilialike reaction

The correct answer is B, Schwannoma with a traumatic ulcerative granuloma with stromal eosinophilialike reaction, because it most closely matches the patient's symptoms and the results of the biopsy.

A. Human papillomavirus–related squamous cell carcinoma is an unlikely diagnosis because the patient's age and the absence of any history of tobacco or alcohol use. Additionally, the histopathological features described in the case, such as ulceration, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, and abundant acute and chronic inflammation replete with eosinophils, are not typical of squamous cell carcinoma.

C. Ulcerated plexiform neurofibroma is also an unlikely diagnosis because the patient's symptoms do not suggest a neurological disorder, and the histopathological features described in the case do not match the characteristic features of plexiform neurofibroma.

D. Ulcerated granular cell tumor is a rare entity, and the patient's symptoms and histopathological features do not suggest this diagnosis.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is B, Schwannoma with a traumatic ulcerative granuloma with stromal eosinophilialike reaction, as it matches the patient's symptoms and the results of the biopsy. The presence of spindle-shaped cells, palisaded areas (Verocay bodies), and an associated inflammatory infiltrate with abundant eosinophils, as well as the positive staining for SOX-10, support this diagnosis.

**Answer**: C. Histoplasmosis

The correct answer is C. Histoplasmosis. The patient's symptoms of dysphagia, nasal regurgitation, nonproductive cough, and breathy voice, along with the physical examination findings of perforation of the hard palate, are consistent with histoplasmosis. The patient's history of HIV infection and recent treatment with HAART, as well as the radiologic findings of necrotic lymph nodes, also support this diagnosis.

Histoplasmosis is a fungal infection caused by Histoplasma capsulatum. It is commonly seen in patients with HIV infection, particularly in those with low CD4 counts. The infection can affect various organs, including the lungs, lymph nodes, and gastrointestinal tract. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with involvement of the palate, which is a rare manifestation of histoplasmosis.

The other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and findings. Tuberculosis of the palate (A) is a possible diagnosis, but it is less likely given the patient's recent treatment with HAART and the absence of other signs of tuberculosis. Tertiary syphilis (B) can cause a variety of symptoms, including nasal and oral lesions, but the patient's history of HIV infection and recent treatment with HAART make it less likely. Sarcoidosis (D) is a systemic inflammatory disease that can affect various organs, including the lungs and lymph nodes, but it is less likely to cause the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Histoplasmosis.

The patient's symptoms of sudden-onset painless blurry vision, reduced visual acuity, and stable posterior segment findings on dilated fundus examination and OCT suggest a possible issue with the intraocular lens (IOL) implanted in the capsular bag. The patient's history of proliferative diabetic retinopathy, previous vitreous hemorrhage, and multiple treatments with intravitreous bevacizumab may have contributed to the development of this issue.

Option B, Perform posterior capsulotomy with Nd:YAG laser, is the correct answer because it addresses the likely cause of the patient's symptoms, which is the hyperdistention of the capsular bag with turbid fluid, as seen in the OCT imaging (Figure 1B). The Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy will create a hole in the posterior capsule, allowing the turbid fluid to drain and relieving the pressure on the IOL, which should improve the patient's visual acuity.

Option A, Perform posterior capsulotomy as part of pars plana vitrectomy, is not the best choice because it involves a more invasive surgical procedure, which may not be necessary at this point. While pars plana vitrectomy may be considered in cases where there is significant vitreous hemorrhage or tractional retinal detachment, it is not the most appropriate approach for this patient's presentation.

Option C, Exchange the IOL, is not the correct answer because it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, which is the hyperdistention of the capsular bag. Moreover, IOL exchange is a more invasive procedure that carries a higher risk of complications, and it may not be necessary if the capsular bag can be successfully decompressed with Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy.

Option D, Observe the patient, is not a viable option because the patient's symptoms are significant and warrant further evaluation and treatment. Observation alone may lead to a delay in proper management and potentially worsen the patient'

The correct answer is D. Perform superficial corneal biopsy.

A. Begin oral acyclovir sodium: This choice is incorrect because there is no indication of a viral infection in the patient's corneas. The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with corneal opacification, which is not typically caused by a viral infection.

B. Perform penetrating keratoplasty: This choice is incorrect because penetrating keratoplasty is a surgical procedure that involves replacing the entire cornea with a donor cornea. It is not indicated in this case because the patient's corneal opacification is limited to the subepithelium and anterior stroma, and the deeper stroma and Descemet's membrane are intact. Penetrating keratoplasty would be excessive and could potentially cause more harm than good.

C. Initiate topical cyclosporine: This choice is incorrect because cyclosporine is an immunosuppressive medication that is used to prevent rejection in organ transplant patients. It has no role in the treatment of corneal opacification.

D. Perform superficial corneal biopsy: This is the correct answer. A superficial corneal biopsy would be appropriate to diagnose the cause of the patient's corneal opacification. The biopsy would allow for a tissue sample to be examined under a microscope to determine the presence of any abnormal cells or tissue. This information would be useful in determining the appropriate treatment for the patient's condition.

In summary, the correct answer is D. Perform superficial corneal biopsy, as it is the most appropriate diagnostic test to determine the cause of the patient's corneal opacification. The other choices are not appropriate based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings.

**Answer**:A. Aspiration with absolute alcohol injection

Aspiration with absolute alcohol injection is the correct answer because it is a minimally invasive procedure that can effectively treat a cystic iris lesion. The procedure involves using a 25-gauge needle to aspirate the cystic contents, followed by injection of absolute alcohol into the cyst to prevent recurrence. This approach has been shown to be safe and effective in several studies, with minimal risk of complications or recurrence.

In contrast, surgical resection (option B) may be associated with a higher risk of complications, such as cataract formation, glaucoma, or retinal detachment. Continued monitoring (option C) may not be appropriate given the patient's worsening symptoms and the growth of the lesion. Laser cystotomy (option D) may not be effective in removing the entire lesion and may also lead to recurrence.

Therefore, aspiration with absolute alcohol injection is the best course of action for this patient's cystic iris lesion.

The correct answer is C: Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits.

The patient presents with a choroidal mass and a subluxed crystalline lens in the right eye, along with a history of congestive heart failure, cleft lip surgery as an infant, and right eye amblyopia. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest the possibility of a posterior segment mass in the right eye.

Option C, Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits, is the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation. MRI is a non-invasive imaging modality that can provide detailed information about the structure and composition of the posterior segment mass, as well as any potential involvement of the surrounding tissues. This information is essential in determining the appropriate management and treatment plan for the patient.

Option A, Plaque radiotherapy, is not appropriate at this stage of the patient's evaluation. Plaque radiotherapy is a treatment modality used for certain types of eye tumors, but it is not typically used for diagnostic purposes. Before considering plaque radiotherapy, the patient's diagnosis needs to be confirmed, and the extent of the tumor needs to be assessed.

Option B, Pars plana lensectomy to remove the subluxed lens, is also not appropriate at this stage. While the patient does have a subluxed crystalline lens, the primary concern is the choroidal mass, which needs to be evaluated and diagnosed before considering any surgical intervention.

Option D, Biopsy of the choroidal mass, may be considered in some cases, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's evaluation. Biopsy carries a risk of complications, including infection and bleeding, and may not provide a definitive diagnosis. MRI is a safer and more non-invasive way to evaluate the mass and determine the appropriate course of action.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits.

**Answer**:B. Primary central nervous system posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder

The patient's symptoms of frequent falls, right-sided lower-extremity weakness, and intermittent confusion, along with the physical examination findings of expressive aphasia, partial left abducens nerve palsy, decreased motor strength in her right upper and lower extremities, and right-sided pronator drift, are consistent with a central nervous system (CNS) disorder. The patient's history of a renal transplant and immunosuppression with alemtuzumab, tacrolimus, and mycophenolate increases the likelihood of a posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD).

The laboratory findings of a white blood cell count of 9.6 K/μL, a lactic acid dehydrogenase level of 547 U/L, and a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) white blood cell count of 51 cells/μL with 92% lymphocytes, suggest a possible infectious or inflammatory process in the CNS. However, the patient's history of immunosuppression and the imaging findings of multifocal vasogenic edema and mass effect causing near complete effacement of the third ventricle and subsequent rightward midline shift, are more consistent with a PTLD.

The patient's age and the presence of a renal transplant increase the likelihood of a PTLD. The patient's lack of antiviral therapy prior to presentation also supports this diagnosis, as PTLDs are often associated with a lack of immunosuppression.

The imaging findings of multiple ring-enhancing lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the positive fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT (PET/CT) are consistent with a malignant process, such as a PTLD. The biopsy findings of a lesional tissue specimen (Figure, B and C) showing CD20-positive cells, support the diagnosis of a B-cell PTLD.

The correct answer is C. Prescribe oral azithromycin.

Azithromycin is an antibiotic that is effective against Mycoplasma pneumoniae, which is a common cause of oral and genital lesions. The patient's positive serum enzyme immunoassay for Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM suggests that he has an active infection. Prescribing oral azithromycin would be an appropriate treatment for the patient's symptoms.

Now, let's discuss why the other answer choices are incorrect:

A. Perform upper endoscopy and colonoscopy: While endoscopy may be useful in evaluating the patient's oral lesions, it is not necessary at this point in the patient's management. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection, and endoscopy would not change the management of the patient's condition. Additionally, colonoscopy is not typically performed in the evaluation of oral lesions.

B. Test for anti–double-stranded DNA antibodies: This test is used to diagnose lupus, an autoimmune disorder that can cause oral and genital lesions. However, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest lupus, and this test would not be helpful in the patient's management.

D. Prescribe oral suspension nystatin: Nystatin is an antifungal medication that is used to treat oral thrush. While the patient does have oral lesions, there is no indication that they are caused by a fungal infection. Prescribing nystatin would not be an appropriate treatment for the patient's symptoms.

In summary, prescribing oral azithromycin is the most appropriate treatment for the patient's symptoms, given the patient's positive serum enzyme immunoassay for Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM and the patient's symptoms consistent with a Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection.

The correct answer is C. Perform detailed review of systemic and topical medications.

The patient's symptoms of dilated pupil and anisocoria, which is more pronounced in bright lighting conditions, suggest a possible diagnosis of Horner's syndrome. Horner's syndrome is a condition that results from damage to the sympathetic nervous system and can be caused by various factors, including medications.

A detailed review of the patient's systemic and topical medications is necessary to determine if any of them could be causing the Horner's syndrome. Certain medications, such as beta-blockers, can cause dilated pupils as a side effect. Additionally, topical medications that are applied to the eye can also cause pupillary dilation.

Therefore, choice C is the correct answer.

On the other hand, the other choices are not as relevant to the patient's symptoms and potential diagnosis:

A. Order computed tomography angiography of the head to rule out aneurysmal compression of the left third cranial nerve: While this test may be necessary to rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, it is not the most appropriate next step given the patient's history of hyperhidrosis and the presence of Horner's syndrome.

B. Order magnetic resonance imaging of the brain to rule out a brainstem stroke: The patient's symptoms do not suggest a brainstem stroke, and this test would not be the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation.

D. Perform pharmacologic testing with apraclonidine to confirm Horner syndrome: While this test may be useful in confirming the diagnosis of Horner's syndrome, it is not necessary at this point in the patient's evaluation. A detailed review of the patient's medications is a more appropriate next step.

**Answer**:B. Stop further nontubercular diagnostic testing and continue antitubercular therapy

Explanation:
The correct answer is B because the patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a high likelihood of tuberculosis (TB) infection. The patient's history of immigration from a high-prevalence country, chronic hepatitis B, and cirrhosis increase the likelihood of TB infection. The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema are consistent with TB pericarditis. The laboratory results show an elevated adenosine deaminase (ADA) level in the pericardial fluid, which is a diagnostic marker for TB.

Given the strong clinical suspicion of TB, it is appropriate to stop further nontubercular diagnostic testing and continue antitubercular therapy. Performing additional pericardial effusion cytology and culture testing (choice A) may not provide a definitive diagnosis and may delay appropriate treatment. Initiating oral colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and steroids for systemic inflammation (choice C) may not address the underlying TB infection. Performing an interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) (choice D) may not provide a definitive diagnosis and may not be necessary given the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory results.

The correct answer is C: Perform an exploratory laparotomy and excision of the mass.

Let's go through each answer choice and explain why it's incorrect or correct:

A: Perform esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD).

EGD is a procedure used to visualize the inside of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. It's not appropriate in this case because the patient's symptoms and CT scan findings suggest a possible mass in the abdomen, not in the upper gastrointestinal tract. EGD wouldn't be able to visualize the mass or help diagnose the patient's condition.

B: Perform diagnostic laparoscopy with peritoneal washings.

Laparoscopy is a minimally invasive surgical procedure used to visualize the inside of the abdomen and pelvis. It can be used for diagnostic purposes, such as identifying the cause of abdominal pain or bleeding, or for therapeutic purposes, such as removing a mass or cyst. However, in this case, the patient's CT scan already suggests the presence of a mass, so a diagnostic laparoscopy wouldn't be necessary. Additionally, peritoneal washings are not typically performed during a diagnostic laparoscopy.

D: Perform an interventional radiology–guided biopsy of the mass.

Interventional radiology–guided biopsy is a procedure used to obtain a tissue sample from a mass or lesion. It's a minimally invasive procedure that uses imaging guidance, such as CT or ultrasound, to guide a needle or catheter to the location of the mass. However, in this case, the patient's symptoms and CT scan findings suggest a possible malignancy, and a biopsy would not be appropriate. Biopsy can disseminate cancer cells and increase the risk of seeding the tumor to other parts of the body.

Therefore, the best answer is C: Perform an exploratory laparotomy and excision of the mass.

Laparotomy is a surgical procedure that involves opening the abdomen to visual

**Answer**:A. Disseminated candidiasis with transepidermal elimination

The patient's history of acute myeloid leukemia, remote history of breast cancer, and current presentation of pink papules with a white firm center and dark brown core, as well as the laboratory findings of leukopenia with neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, are consistent with disseminated candidiasis. The patient's history of broad-spectrum antibiotic, antifungal, and antiviral treatment for a prior episode of neutropenic fever suggests that the patient has been exposed to immunosuppressive therapy, which increases the risk of developing disseminated candidiasis.

The patient's skin lesions are consistent with perforating papules, which are a rare cutaneous manifestation of disseminated candidiasis. Perforating papules are characterized by small, discrete, pink papules with a white firm center and dark brown core. The presence of these papules in a patient with acute myeloid leukemia and a history of breast cancer suggests that the patient has disseminated candidiasis with transepidermal elimination.

The other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's skin lesions. Reactive perforating collagenosis (answer choice B) is a condition characterized by the development of perforating papules in response to various stimuli, such as infection, inflammation, or trauma. However, the patient's history and laboratory findings do not support this diagnosis. Disseminated cryptococcosis (answer choice C) is a fungal infection caused by Cryptococcus neoformans that can cause skin lesions, but the patient's history and laboratory findings do not support this diagnosis. Malassezia (formerly Pityrosporum) folliculitis (answer choice D) is a fungal infection of the skin caused by Malassezia globosa that can cause papules and pustules, but the patient's history and laboratory findings do not support this diagnosis.

**Answer**:C. Malignant acanthosis nigricans

The correct answer is C. Malignant acanthosis nigricans because it aligns with the patient's symptoms and laboratory test results.

A. Benign acanthosis nigricans is an incorrect choice because, although it is a condition that causes dark, velvety patches on the skin, it is not associated with the patient's other symptoms, such as weight loss, enlarged thyroid, anorexia, and abdominal discomfort. Additionally, the patient's laboratory test results reveal remarkably elevated levels of carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 19-9, carbohydrate antigen 125, tissue polypeptide antigen, and carbohydrate antigen 242, which are not typical of benign acanthosis nigricans.

B. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is an incorrect choice because, although it can cause skin lesions, it is not typically associated with the patient's other symptoms, such as weight loss, enlarged thyroid, anorexia, and abdominal discomfort. Additionally, the patient's laboratory test results do not suggest a diagnosis of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

D. Malignant Addison disease is an incorrect choice because, although it can cause darkening of the skin, it is a rare condition that affects the adrenal glands and is not associated with the patient's other symptoms.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Malignant acanthosis nigricans, which is a rare condition that can cause widespread thickened, verrucous, hyperpigmented plaques on the skin, as well as other symptoms such as weight loss, enlarged thyroid, anorexia, and abdominal discomfort. The patient's laboratory test results also support this diagnosis.

**Answer**: B. Cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis

The correct answer is B. Cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis because it matches the given symptoms and laboratory results.

Cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis is a condition where the blood vessels in the skin become inflamed, leading to the formation of purple or red spots on the skin. This condition is often associated with systemic vasculitis, which is an inflammation of the blood vessels throughout the body.

In this case, the patient presented with a generalized rash over the lower extremities and trunk, which is consistent with cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The rash was also associated with pedal edema, which is swelling of the feet and ankles, which is another common symptom of this condition.

The laboratory results also support this diagnosis. The patient's erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was elevated, which is a common finding in patients with vasculitis. The lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level was also elevated, which suggests that there is tissue damage or breakdown.

The other answer choices do not match the patient's symptoms and laboratory results as well as cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis.

Acrokeratosis paraneoplastica (choice A) is a condition where the skin becomes thickened and hardened, and is often associated with cancer. While the patient did have a history of smoking, which is a risk factor for cancer, there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has cancer.

Cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis (choice C) is a more severe form of vasculitis that can lead to skin necrosis and scarring. While the patient's rash was extensive and had been present for some time, there was no evidence of skin necrosis or scarring.

Henoch-Schönlein purpura (choice D) is a condition where the blood vessels in the skin become inflamed and leak, leading to the formation of purple spots on the skin. While the patient did have a rash, it was not consistent with Hen

**Answer**: C. Treat medically with aspirin, β-blocker, clopidogrel, and a statin

The patient in the scenario presents with symptoms of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), including chest pain, radiation to the left arm, and elevated troponin levels. The electrocardiogram (ECG) shows marked ST-segment elevations in leads V2 to V5, which is consistent with a ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

Given the patient's history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and multiparity, as well as the presence of mild bibasilar crackles and jugular venous distention on physical examination, it is likely that the patient has underlying coronary artery disease (CAD). The coronary angiogram confirms this, showing a significant lesion in the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD).

The correct answer, C, Treat medically with aspirin, β-blocker, clopidogrel, and a statin, is the most appropriate treatment plan for this patient.

Aspirin is an antiplatelet agent that works by inhibiting platelet aggregation, which can help to prevent further blood clot formation and reduce the risk of myocardial infarction. β-blockers, such as metoprolol, work by reducing the heart rate and blood pressure, which can help to reduce the demand for oxygen and alleviate angina symptoms. Clopidogrel is a P2Y12 inhibitor that works by inhibiting platelet activation and aggregation, which can help to prevent stent thrombosis and reduce the risk of myocardial infarction. Statins, such as atorvastatin, work by reducing cholesterol levels and improving lipid profiles, which can help to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events.

In contrast, choice A, Treat medically with aspirin alone, is not sufficient for this patient's condition, as the patient requires more comprehensive treatment to address the underlying CAD and reduce the risk of myocardial infarction.

**Answer**: C. Oral metastasis

The correct answer is C. Oral metastasis because the patient's symptoms and clinical findings are consistent with a metastatic lesion in the gingiva. The patient has a history of stage IV endometrial serous adenocarcinoma, which increases her risk of developing metastatic lesions in distant sites, including the oral cavity. The presence of a firm, erythematous gingival mass with buccal and lingual expansion, as well as the presence of a diffuse, poorly demarcated radiolucency on the periapical radiograph, are both consistent with a metastatic lesion. The incisional biopsy findings, which showed an infiltrative tumor with positive staining for CK7, PAX8, and WT-1, and negative staining for CK20 and TTF-1, also support the diagnosis of an oral metastasis.

In contrast, choice A, Pyogenic granuloma, is an inflammatory lesion that is typically associated with a history of trauma or local irritation. While it can present with similar clinical findings, such as a red, swollen, and painful mass, the histopathologic features are distinct and do not include the presence of an infiltrative tumor.

Choice B, Gingival/periodontal abscess, is an infection of the soft tissues of the periodontium, typically caused by bacteria. While it can also present with pain, swelling, and redness in the affected area, the clinical findings and radiographic features are different from those seen in oral metastasis.

Choice D, Squamous cell carcinoma, is a type of oral cancer that can arise in the gingiva. However, the clinical and histopathologic features of this patient's lesion are not consistent with squamous cell carcinoma. The presence of an infiltrative tumor with positive staining for CK7, PAX8, and WT-1, and negative staining for CK20 and TTF-1, is not typical of squamous cell carcinoma

**Answer**: C. HSV-2 pharyngitis

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with HSV-2 pharyngitis. The patient's history of pharyngeal gonorrhea increases the likelihood of a viral co-infection, such as HSV-2. The presence of ulcerative lesions with exudate and erythema extending diffusely along the base of tongue, oropharynx, nasopharynx, hypopharynx, and epiglottis, as seen on flexible fiber-optic nasopharyngoscopy, is also consistent with HSV-2 pharyngitis.

A. Diphtheria is unlikely given the patient's history of recent negative rapid Streptococcus test and the absence of cervical lymphadenopathy. Diphtheria typically presents with a severe sore throat, fever, and swollen neck lymph nodes.

B. Mononucleosis, or glandular fever, is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and can present with a sore throat, fever, and lymphadenopathy. However, the patient's negative recent HIV screen and absence of dysphonia or dyspnea make mononucleosis less likely.

D. Pharyngeal gonorrhea is a possibility, given the patient's history of pharyngeal gonorrhea, but it is less likely given the patient's negative rapid plasma reagin test and the absence of genital lesions or symptoms. Additionally, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are more consistent with HSV-2 pharyngitis.

Therefore, C. HSV-2 pharyngitis is the most likely diagnosis.

**Answer**: D. Aspergillosis

The correct diagnosis is D. Aspergillosis, based on the patient's symptoms and the results of the flexible laryngotracheoscopy and biopsy.

Aspergillosis is a fungal infection caused by Aspergillus species, which can affect various organs in the body, including the respiratory system. In this case, the patient's symptoms of progressive cough, dyspnea, hoarseness, and fever, along with the physical examination findings of limited glottic mobility and substantial airway obstruction, are consistent with a respiratory infection.

The laryngoscopic images and biopsy results support the diagnosis of Aspergillosis. The pseudomembranous plaques lining the supraglottis and glottis, as well as the posterior wall of the trachea, are characteristic of Aspergillus infection. Additionally, the biopsy demonstrates branching organisms superficial to squamous epithelium, which is consistent with Aspergillus hyphae.

The other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and findings.

A. Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a complication that can occur after organ transplantation, caused by excessive immune suppression. PTLD can affect various organs, including the respiratory system, but the patient's symptoms and examination findings do not suggest this diagnosis.

B. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a type of cancer that can affect the respiratory system, but the patient's symptoms and examination findings do not suggest this diagnosis. SCC typically presents with a persistent cough, hemoptysis, and weight loss, and the patient's history of smoking increases the risk. However, the patient's symptoms have been progressive over a short period, which is not consistent with the slow growth of SCC.

**Answer**: D. Nasal cavity hamartoma

The correct answer is D. Nasal cavity hamartoma because it matches the description of the patient's symptoms and the results of the biopsy.

A. Low-grade sinonasal adenocarcinoma is an unlikely diagnosis because the patient did not present with any symptoms suggestive of a sinonasal tumor, such as nasal obstruction, epistaxis, or facial pain. Additionally, the biopsy results did not reveal any malignant cells.

B. Inflammatory nasal polyps are not a likely diagnosis because the patient did not have any significant nasal symptoms, such as nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, or loss of sense of smell. Moreover, the presence of cystic change and heterogeneously hyperintense T2 signal on MRI suggests a more complex lesion than a simple inflammatory polyp.

C. Inverted papilloma is also an unlikely diagnosis because it typically presents with unilateral nasal obstruction, bleeding, or discharge, which were not reported in this case. Furthermore, the biopsy results did not reveal any characteristic features of inverted papilloma, such as papillary architecture or squamous metaplasia.

D. Nasal cavity hamartoma is the most appropriate diagnosis because it can cause polypoid masses in the nasal cavity, as seen in this case, and can also result in widening and remodeling of the olfactory clefts. The biopsy results support this diagnosis, as they showed submucosal proliferation of seromucinous and respiratory epithelial glands, which is consistent with the characteristic histological features of nasal cavity hamartoma.

**Answer**:A. Initiate a trial of carbamazepine

Explanation:

A. Initiate a trial of carbamazepine is the correct answer because it is a common treatment for gaze-provoked exotropia, which is a type of strabismus that occurs when the eye deviates outward when looking in a specific direction (in this case, to the right). Carbamazepine is an anticonvulsant medication that can help to reduce the frequency and severity of the exotropia by suppressing the abnormal electrical activity in the brain that is causing the eye to deviate.

B. Perform bilateral lateral rectus recessions is an incorrect answer because it is a surgical procedure that is typically used to treat strabismus, but it is not specifically indicated for gaze-provoked exotropia. In addition, it is not clear whether the patient has a significant angle of strabismus that would require surgical intervention.

C. Order cranial magnetic resonance imaging is an incorrect answer because it is not clear whether the patient has any intracranial pathology that would be relevant to the patient's symptoms. While it is possible that the patient may have a structural abnormality in the brain that is contributing to the exotropia, it is not the most likely explanation for the patient's symptoms.

D. Obtain anti-acetylcholine receptor binding antibodies is an incorrect answer because it is not clear whether the patient has an autoimmune disorder that is contributing to the exotropia. While autoimmune disorders can cause various neurological symptoms, including ophthalmological symptoms, it is not the most likely explanation for the patient's symptoms in this case.

**Answer**:A. Obtain magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits

The correct answer is A, "Obtain magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits," because it is the most appropriate next step in the evaluation of this patient's conjunctival lesion.

The patient's symptoms, such as a painless, reddish mass in the lateral conjunctiva that has been present since birth, and rare episodes of pink tears in the right eye, suggest that the lesion may be a benign conjunctival tumor, such as a conjunctival melanocytic nevus. However, it is important to rule out other possible causes of the lesion, such as a malignant melanoma or a metastatic lesion from a primary tumor elsewhere in the body.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits can help to identify any potential intracranial or orbital lesions that may be related to the conjunctival lesion. MRI is a non-invasive imaging modality that can provide high-resolution images of the brain and orbits, allowing for a detailed evaluation of the lesion and its relationship to surrounding structures.

In contrast, option B, "Complete an excisional biopsy of the lesion," may not be the most appropriate next step at this time. While a biopsy may ultimately be necessary to establish a definitive diagnosis, it is important to first gather more information about the lesion and its potential relationship to other structures in the head and neck. Performing a biopsy without first obtaining appropriate imaging may lead to unnecessary risk to the patient, such as damage to surrounding tissues or the introduction of infection.

Option C, "Complete needle drainage of the lesion," is not appropriate at this time, as there is no indication of a fluid-filled lesion that would require drainage.

Option D, "Initiate systemic propranolol," is also not appropriate, as there is no indication of a vascular tumor or other condition that would require this treatment. Propranolol is a medication that is commonly used to treat conditions such as hypertension, angina, and certain types of tremors, but it is not typically used in

**Answer**: B. Iodine 125 plaque brachytherapy

The correct answer is B. Iodine 125 plaque brachytherapy, because it is a treatment option that is specifically used for choroidal melanomas, which is the most likely diagnosis for the patient's condition based on the symptoms and examination findings described in the case.

Iodine 125 plaque brachytherapy is a form of radiation therapy that involves placing a small radioactive plaque directly onto the tumor site. The plaque emits radiation that is absorbed by the tumor, causing damage to the cancer cells and leading to shrinkage or destruction of the tumor. This treatment modality is particularly useful for choroidal melanomas that are located near the fovea, as it allows for precise targeting of the tumor while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissue.

The other answer choices are not appropriate for several reasons:

A. Photodynamic therapy is a treatment that involves the use of a light-sensitive drug and a low-intensity laser to damage cancer cells. While it has been used for certain types of eye cancer, it is not typically used for choroidal melanomas and would not be appropriate for this patient's condition.

C. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy injections are used to treat certain eye conditions, such as age-related macular degeneration, by blocking the growth of new blood vessels. However, it is not a treatment option for choroidal melanomas, as it does not target the cancer cells directly.

D. External beam radiotherapy is a treatment that involves directing high-energy radiation beams at the tumor site from outside the body. While it can be effective for some types of cancer, it is not typically used for choroidal melanomas, as it can cause significant damage to surrounding healthy tissue and may not be able to target the tumor precisely.

In summary, B. Iodine 125 plaque brachytherapy is the most appropriate treatment option for this patient's condition, as it is a targeted and effective treatment for choroidal mel

**Answer**:B. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain/orbits

The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest that there may be a compressive or infiltrative lesion affecting the optic nerves, which could be causing the visual field loss and cupping. The supratemporal optic nerve pit in the right eye and the perifoveal thinning on OCT also support this possibility.

Option A, observation, is not appropriate as it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and may lead to further visual loss.

Option C, referral to endocrinology, may be appropriate in the future if the patient's pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency is suspected to be contributing to the visual loss, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this time.

Option D, repeated visual fields with IOP check in 1 month, may be useful in monitoring the progression of the patient's visual field loss, but it does not address the underlying cause of the symptoms and may not provide sufficient information to guide management decisions.

In contrast, option B, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain/orbits, can help to identify any compressive or infiltrative lesions affecting the optic nerves, such as a tumor or an inflammatory condition, and guide further management decisions. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate answer.

**Answer**:B. Perform emergency surgery for aortic valve repair

The patient's symptoms of fever, dyspnea, and generalized weakness, along with the physical examination findings of tachycardia, tachypnea, and bilateral lung crackles, suggest a severe respiratory infection with sepsis. The patient's history of hypertension and the presence of a soft S1 on cardiac examination suggest that the patient may have a cardiac condition that is contributing to the sepsis.

The bedside transthoracic echocardiogram showed a large, mobile aortic valve vegetation, which is consistent with infective endocarditis. Infective endocarditis is a surgical emergency that requires prompt treatment.

Option A, ordering diuresis with furosemide and serial echocardiograms, may help to manage the patient's fluid overload and monitor the progression of the disease, but it does not address the underlying cause of the infection.

Option C, placing an intra-aortic balloon pump, may help to support the patient's cardiac function, but it is not a definitive treatment for infective endocarditis.

Option D, starting broad-spectrum antibiotics and observing the patient, may help to manage the infection, but it does not address the underlying cause of the infection, which is the infected aortic valve.

Therefore, the best answer is option B, performing emergency surgery for aortic valve repair. This option addresses the underlying cause of the infection and provides the best chance of successful treatment.

**Answer**: B. Scleromyxedema

Scleromyxedema is a rare autoimmune disorder that is characterized by the deposition of mucin in the skin, leading to thickening and hardening of the skin, as well as the formation of papules and plaques. The patient's symptoms, such as diffuse skin-colored to pink papules coalescing into plaques on the entire face, exaggerated skin folds of the forehead, glabella, periocular regions, and superior cutaneous lip, swelling and erythema of both ears, diffuse infiltration of the skin, and decreased finger flexion, are all consistent with scleromyxedema.

The patient's laboratory results, including a normal level of thyroid-stimulating hormone, macrocytic anemia, normal creatinine and calcium levels, and a monoclonal spike on a serum protein electrophoresis test, also support the diagnosis of scleromyxedema. The presence of mucin deposition in the reticular dermis, as shown in the punch biopsy, is also consistent with scleromyxedema.

In contrast, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides [MF]), lepromatous leprosy, and scleroderma are all conditions that can cause skin thickening and hardening, but they have distinct clinical and laboratory features that are not consistent with the patient's presentation.

Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides [MF]) is a type of cancer that affects the skin and can cause skin thickening and hardening, but it typically presents with scaly, erythematous patches or plaques, and the patient's skin lesions do not have the characteristic appearance of MF.

Lepromatous leprosy is a type of leprosy that can cause skin thickening and nodules, but it typically affects the skin and peripheral nerves, and the patient's symptoms do not suggest peripheral nerve involvement.

Scleroderma is a connective tissue disorder that can cause

**Answer**: B. Hyperkeratosis lenticularis perstans

Hyperkeratosis lenticularis perstans, also known as HLP, is a rare, benign, and chronic skin condition characterized by the gradual appearance of small, discrete, reddish-brown papules on the skin, typically on the legs, arms, and trunk. The condition is often associated with diabetes mellitus, as in the case of the patient described in the question.

The clinical presentation of HLP is consistent with the patient's history of a slowly progressive, asymptomatic cutaneous eruption on his left leg, with reddish-brown hyperkeratotic papules ranging in size from 1 to 10 mm in diameter. The lesions are typically round or oval and have a characteristic "stuck-on" appearance.

The histopathological features of HLP, as shown in the images provided, are also consistent with the diagnosis. The biopsy specimen reveals compact hyperkeratosis, epidermal atrophy, and a band-like lymphocyte infiltrate in the superficial dermis. These features are characteristic of HLP and help to distinguish it from other skin conditions.

In contrast, the other answer choices do not fit the patient's clinical presentation or histopathological features:

A. Stucco keratoses are small, rough, scaly papules that can occur on the skin, particularly on the hands and feet. They are usually brown or gray in color and have a rough, sandpapery texture. While they can be associated with diabetes mellitus, they are typically not as large as the papules described in the patient's history, and they do not have the same histopathological features as HLP.

C. Disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP) is a rare, chronic skin condition characterized by the development of multiple small, scaly papules on sun-exposed areas of the skin. While DSAP can occur on the legs, it typically affects the arms, hands, and face. The papules are usually smaller than those described in the patient's history

**Answer**: C. Faciobrachial dystonic seizures

The correct answer is C. Faciobrachial dystonic seizures because the symptoms described in the case, including transient episodes of expressive speech difficulties, paroxysmal dizziness, and involuntary nonsuppressible jerks of the right arm, are consistent with this diagnosis. Faciobrachial dystonic seizures are a type of epilepsy that is characterized by involuntary, synchronous contractions of the face, arm, and leg, which is exactly what is seen in the video electroencephalography (EEG) provided.

In contrast, myoclonus (choice A) refers to sudden, brief muscle jerks or twitches, which are not sustained like the movements described in the case. Paroxysmal dyskinesia (choice B) refers to a group of movement disorders characterized by recurrent, episodic, involuntary movements that are often slow and writhing, rather than the sudden, synchronous contractions seen in this case. Tic disorder (choice D) refers to a group of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by recurrent, involuntary movements or vocalizations (tics), which are not typically associated with the type of synchronous muscle contractions seen in this case.

Therefore, based on the symptoms described and the results of the EEG and MRI, the most likely diagnosis is faciobrachial dystonic seizures.

**Answer**:D. Order cerebral angiography

The correct answer is D. Order cerebral angiography, as it is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's condition.

The patient presents with a persistently red eye, decreased vision, and a history of meningioma, which suggests a possible underlying vascular etiology. The presence of scattered intraretinal hemorrhages and cystoid macular edema on imaging supports this suspicion.

Intravitreal injection of an antivascular endothelial growth factor agent (Option A) may be effective in treating macular edema and reducing the risk of further vision loss, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's history of meningioma and the presence of intraretinal hemorrhages suggest a possible underlying vascular abnormality that needs to be evaluated further before considering intravitreal treatment.

Starting systemic corticosteroids (Option B) may be considered in the management of uveitis, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's history of meningioma and the presence of intraretinal hemorrhages suggest a possible underlying vascular abnormality that needs to be evaluated further before considering corticosteroid therapy.

Obtaining laboratory workup for uveitis (Option C) may be considered in the evaluation of uveitis, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's history of meningioma and the presence of intraretinal hemorrhages suggest a possible underlying vascular abnormality that needs to be evaluated further before considering laboratory workup.

Ordering cerebral angiography (Option D) is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's condition. It will help to evaluate the possibility of a vascular malformation or aneurysm that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms and signs, such as the scattered intraretinal hemorrhages and cystoid macular edema. The result of the angiography will guide further management, which may include referral to a neurosurgeon or interventional neuroradiologist for further evaluation and treatment.

**Answer**:A. Computed tomographic scan of the orbits with contrast

A: Computed tomographic scan of the orbits with contrast is the correct answer because it is the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic workup of this patient's symptoms. The patient's gradual onset of binocular, horizontal diplopia and ptosis of the left upper eyelid, along with the physical examination findings of restricted abduction, substantial resistance to retropulsion, and enophthalmos, suggest a possible orbital or ocular motor disorder. A CT scan of the orbits with contrast can help to identify any structural abnormalities or lesions in the orbits, such as a tumor or aneurysm, that may be causing the patient's symptoms.

B: Myasthenia gravis testing is not the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic workup of this patient's symptoms. While myasthenia gravis can cause diplopia and ptosis, the patient's symptoms of gradual onset and restricted abduction are not typical of myasthenia gravis. Additionally, there is no history of fatigue or weakness, which are common symptoms of myasthenia gravis.

C: Referral for strabismus surgery is not the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic workup of this patient's symptoms. Strabismus surgery is typically performed to align the eyes in cases of strabismus, which is not the primary complaint of this patient. The patient's symptoms of diplopia and ptosis suggest a problem with the extraocular muscles or orbital structures, which may be better evaluated with imaging studies such as a CT scan.

D: Thyroid function testing is not the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic workup of this patient's symptoms. While thyroid disorders can cause eye symptoms such as diplopia, the patient's symptoms of gradual onset and restricted abduction are not typical of thyroid-related eye disorders. Additionally, there is no history of thyroid symptoms such as weight change, fatigue, or cold intolerance.

The correct answer is C. Excisional biopsy.

An excisional biopsy is the removal of a small portion of the corneal lesion for further examination. This is the most appropriate choice in this case because the patient has a history of herpetic keratitis and postoperative bullous keratopathy, which may have contributed to the development of the corneal mass. The lesion's gelatinous appearance and presence of both intrinsic and feeder vessels also suggest that it may be a benign tumor, such as a keratoacanthoma or a pyogenic granuloma. An excisional biopsy would allow for a definitive diagnosis and guide further management.

In contrast, local therapy with 5-fluorouracil (choice A) may be appropriate for superficial corneal lesions, but it is not the best choice for a raised, gelatinous lesion with intrinsic and feeder vessels. Incisional biopsy (choice B) may be appropriate for some corneal lesions, but it may not provide a complete picture of the lesion and may not be necessary in this case. Observation (choice D) may be appropriate for some cases, but it is not the best choice for a patient with a history of herpetic keratitis and postoperative complications, as close monitoring and management are necessary to prevent further complications.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Excisional biopsy.

**Answer**:A. Bleomycin toxic effects

Bleomycin is a chemotherapy drug that is commonly used to treat Hodgkin lymphoma, and it is known to cause skin toxic effects, including pruritus and rash. The patient in the case presented with a pruritic rash that developed within 24 hours of the first day of treatment with bleomycin, which is consistent with the expected timeline for bleomycin-related skin toxicities. The rash was also characterized by linear, hyperpigmented streaks and welts on the arms, back, and legs, which is consistent with the pattern of skin involvement seen in bleomycin-related skin toxicities.

The other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms.

B. Paraneoplastic skin disease: This is a rare condition that occurs in association with certain types of cancer, including lymphoma. It is characterized by the development of skin lesions that are not directly related to the cancer itself, but rather to the immune system's response to the cancer. The patient's rash does not fit the typical pattern of paraneoplastic skin disease, which tends to be more widespread and may involve multiple skin sites.

C. Polymorphic eruption of pregnancy: This is a benign skin condition that occurs in some pregnant women, typically in the third trimester. It is characterized by the development of small, itchy bumps on the skin that may coalesce into larger plaques. The patient's rash does not fit the typical pattern of polymorphic eruption of pregnancy, which tends to be more widespread and may involve multiple skin sites.

D. Vinblastine toxic effects: Vinblastine is another chemotherapy drug that is commonly used to treat Hodgkin lymphoma. It can cause skin toxic effects, including pruritus and rash, but these effects tend to be less common and less severe than those associated with bleomycin. The patient's rash does not fit the typical pattern of vinblastine-related skin toxicities, which tend to be more generalized and may involve the development of small, painful blisters.

**Answer**: C. Burkitt lymphoma

Burkitt lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the immune system, specifically B cells. It is characterized by the rapid growth of cancer cells in the lymphatic system, which can lead to the formation of tumors in various parts of the body, including the skin.

The patient in the case presented with multiple cutaneous nodules and limb swelling, which are common symptoms of Burkitt lymphoma. The fact that the lesions started as red nodules on the left axilla, ipsilateral chest, and back, and then spread to other parts of the body, is also consistent with the disease.

The patient's low CD4 cell count and high HIV load suggest that he has AIDS, which is a common risk factor for the development of Burkitt lymphoma. The patient's age, gender, and the presence of axillary lymphadenopathy also fit the demographic profile for Burkitt lymphoma.

The skin biopsy results showed infiltration with lymphoid cells and few histiocytes in the subcutaneous tissue, which is consistent with Burkitt lymphoma. The cells showed nuclear positivity for c-Myc, which is a common marker for Burkitt lymphoma.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, medical history, and test results, the most likely diagnosis is Burkitt lymphoma.

Now, let's discuss why the other choices are incorrect:

A. Kaposi sarcoma: Kaposi sarcoma is a type of cancer that affects the skin and lymphatic system. It is caused by a virus and is more common in people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS. However, the patient's symptoms and test results do not fit the profile for Kaposi sarcoma. The patient does not have the characteristic skin lesions, and the skin biopsy results do not show the characteristic spindle-shaped cells.

**Answer**: D. Administer intravenous thiamine therapy

The correct answer is D. Administer intravenous thiamine therapy, as the patient's history of alcohol abuse and recent onset of symptoms suggest a possible diagnosis of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, a thiamine deficiency disorder. Thiamine is essential for the proper functioning of the heart and nervous system, and deficiency can lead to cardiac failure and neurological symptoms. Intravenous thiamine therapy is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's condition, as it can help to rapidly reverse the thiamine deficiency and improve the patient's symptoms.

The other options are not appropriate for the following reasons:

A. Start extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy: This option is not appropriate as the patient's respiratory and cardiac function are stable, and there is no indication for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy.

B. Administer intravenous β-blocker therapy: While β-blockers may be used to manage tachycardia in some cases, they are not the most appropriate choice for this patient's condition. The patient's tachycardia is likely due to increased sympathetic activity caused by hypoxia and acidosis, and β-blockers may worsen the patient's condition by reducing cardiac output.

C. Administer intravenous bicarbonate therapy: While bicarbonate therapy may be used to treat metabolic acidosis, it is not the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's condition. The patient's metabolic acidosis is likely due to thiamine deficiency, and bicarbonate therapy alone will not address the underlying cause of the acidosis. Intravenous thiamine therapy is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's condition, as it can help to rapidly reverse the thiamine deficiency and improve the patient's symptoms.

**Answer**:B. Epidermoid cyst

The patient's symptoms and the results of the CT scan are consistent with an epidermoid cyst. The cyst is a slow-growing, painless mass in the floor of the mouth, which is compressible and mobile. The patient does not have any associated symptoms such as dysphagia, odynophagia, or weight loss, which suggests that the cyst is not causing any obstruction or discomfort. The CT scan shows a well-defined, homogeneous mass in the floor of the mouth, which is consistent with an epidermoid cyst.

Option A, simple ranula, is not a possible diagnosis as it is a benign tumor that arises from the salivary gland tissue and usually presents as a painless mass in the neck or floor of the mouth. The patient's symptoms and the CT scan findings do not support this diagnosis.

Option C, vascular malformation, is also not a possible diagnosis as it is a congenital abnormality of the blood vessels that can cause pain, swelling, and discoloration in the affected area. The patient's symptoms and the CT scan findings do not suggest a vascular malformation.

Option D, odontogenic abscess, is not a possible diagnosis as it is a collection of pus that forms in response to a bacterial infection in a tooth or the surrounding tissue. The patient's symptoms and the CT scan findings do not support this diagnosis.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and the CT scan findings, the most likely diagnosis is an epidermoid cyst.

The correct answer is B, Cocaine-induced midline destructive lesion, because the patient's history of cocaine use and the physical examination findings of nasal septal perforation, nasal and preseptal soft-tissue thickening, and periosteal reaction of the nasal process of the maxilla are consistent with this diagnosis. Cocaine-induced midline destructive lesions are a known complication of long-term cocaine use and are characterized by progressive destruction of the nasal septum and surrounding tissues.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis: This is a systemic vasculitis that can affect the nasal passages and sinuses, but it is not associated with cocaine use. The patient's history and physical examination findings do not suggest this diagnosis.

C. Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type: This is a rare type of cancer that affects the nasal passages and sinuses. While it can cause nasal septal perforation and soft-tissue necrosis, it is not associated with cocaine use. The patient's history and physical examination findings do not suggest this diagnosis.

D. Chronic invasive fungal sinusitis: This is a common complication of chronic sinusitis, but it is not associated with cocaine use. The patient's history and physical examination findings do not suggest this diagnosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is B, Cocaine-induced midline destructive lesion.

**Answer**:A. Inquire about rodent and other animal exposures

The correct answer is A, "Inquire about rodent and other animal exposures," because the patient's symptoms of fever, rash, and migratory polyarthralgias, as well as the negative tests for sexually transmitted infections and respiratory viruses, suggest a possible diagnosis of Lyme disease. Lyme disease is a tick-borne illness caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted through the bite of an infected blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis). The patient's exposure to ticks and other animals on the farm in Connecticut increases the likelihood of Lyme disease. Therefore, it is important to inquire about the patient's exposure to ticks and other animals to help confirm the diagnosis.

B, "Obtain joint fluid for bacterial analysis and cultures," is an incorrect choice because while it may be appropriate to obtain joint fluid for bacterial analysis and cultures in some cases of arthritis or arthralgia, it is not the most appropriate next step in this case given the patient's symptoms and exposure history.

C, "Test for Borrelia burgdorferi," is also an incorrect choice because while testing for Borrelia burgdorferi may be appropriate in some cases of suspected Lyme disease, it is not the most appropriate next step in this case given the patient's symptoms and exposure history. It would be more appropriate to first inquire about the patient's exposure to ticks and other animals, and then consider testing for Borrelia burgdorferi if the patient reports a history of tick exposure.

D, "Test vesicular fluid for enterovirus," is an incorrect choice because enterovirus is a virus that causes gastrointestinal symptoms, such as diarrhea and vomiting, and is not associated with the patient's symptoms of fever, rash, and migratory polyarthralgias. Additionally, the patient's negative tests for respiratory viruses make it less likely that the patient has an enterovirus infection.

**Answer**:B. Core needle biopsy of the lesion

The patient presented with a large, palpable, nontender right gluteal mass, with no other associated symptoms. Laboratory studies were within normal limits, and CT revealed an 11-cm heterogeneous lipomatous tumor involving the right gluteal musculature.

Option A, incisional biopsy, is not the best choice as it is an invasive procedure that carries a higher risk of complications, such as infection, bleeding, and scarring. Additionally, the patient is 71 years old, and the risk of complications may be higher in this age group.

Option C, simple excision of the lesion, is also not the best choice. While it may be tempting to remove the mass, it is not appropriate to do so without first obtaining a tissue diagnosis. Simple excision without a preoperative diagnosis may lead to unnecessary surgery, and it may not provide adequate information to guide further management.

Option D, repeat imaging in 6 months, is not the best choice. While it may be reasonable to monitor the lesion with repeat imaging, it is not appropriate to delay a diagnosis for 6 months. The patient has a large, palpable mass that is likely causing discomfort and anxiety, and it is important to provide a diagnosis and appropriate management as soon as possible.

Therefore, the best choice is option B, core needle biopsy of the lesion. This is a minimally invasive procedure that can provide a tissue diagnosis with minimal risk of complications. It will allow for an accurate diagnosis and guide further management, which may include surgical excision or other treatments.

**Answer**:C. Bullous Wells syndrome

The patient's presentation of vesicles and bullae on the right cheek, neck, back, both eyelids, and the dorsal surface of his hands, along with edema and fever, is consistent with the symptoms of Bullous Wells syndrome. This is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by the development of tense bullae and erythematous plaques on the skin, often in response to an infection or medication. The patient's history of being treated for herpes zoster with famciclovir and the presence of viral cultures in the exudate support this diagnosis.

Option A, famciclovir-resistant disseminated herpes zoster, is unlikely as the patient had been treated with famciclovir for 1 week, and the lesions continued to develop, which suggests that the medication was not effective in controlling the virus.

Option B, Bullous Sweet syndrome, is a rare autoimmune disorder that presents with large, tense bullae and erythematous plaques on the skin, often in association with inflammatory bowel disease or other autoimmune disorders. While the patient's presentation of bullae and erythematous plaques is similar, the absence of other autoimmune disorders or inflammatory bowel disease makes this diagnosis less likely.

Option D, Bullous pemphigoid, is a rare autoimmune disorder that presents with large, tense bullae and erythematous plaques on the skin, often in association with autoantibodies against the basement membrane zone. While the patient's presentation of bullae and erythematous plaques is similar, the absence of autoantibodies against the basement membrane zone and the presence of viral cultures in the exudate support a diagnosis of Bullous Wells syndrome over Bullous pemphigoid.

**Answer**: D. Telangiectatic metastatic breast carcinoma

The correct answer is D. Telangiectatic metastatic breast carcinoma because it best fits the patient's symptoms and medical history.

The patient presents with violaceous swelling with telangiectasia and necrosis on the face, predominantly involving the left side. This is consistent with the distribution of breast cancer metastases to the skin, which often present as violaceous lesions or plaques with telangiectasia. The patient's history of left breast carcinoma and left supraclavicular lymph nodes metastasis supports this diagnosis.

Option A, cutaneous angiosarcoma, is unlikely because it is a rare malignancy that typically affects the skin of the scalp, face, or neck in older adults. While it can present with similar symptoms, the patient's history of breast cancer and metastasis makes it less likely.

Option B, radiation dermatitis, is also unlikely because the patient has not received recent radiation therapy. Radiation dermatitis typically occurs within a few weeks to months after radiation exposure and is characterized by acute skin changes such as erythema, edema, and desquamation. The patient's symptoms of pain and swelling, as well as the presence of telangiectasia and necrosis, are not consistent with radiation dermatitis.

Option C, Wolf isotopic response, is not a valid diagnosis. Wolf isotopic response is a phenomenon that occurs in patients with thyroid cancer who have been treated with radioactive iodine, where the thyroid tissue takes up the radioactive iodine and can cause a localized reaction. This is not relevant to the patient's symptoms or medical history.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Telangiectatic metastatic breast carcinoma.

**Answer**:B. Posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder

The patient's history of orthotopic liver transplantation and the use of immunosuppressive drugs, such as tacrolimus and mycophenolate, suggest that the patient is at risk of developing posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). The patient's symptoms, including the acute onset of abdominal skin eruption and the annular configuration encircling the OLT scar, are consistent with PTLD. The patient's history of gastric outlet obstruction secondary to an infiltrative gastric wall mass, which was found to be associated with plasmablastic PTLD, further supports this diagnosis.

The patient's skin biopsy shows an atypical, hyperchromatic infiltrate present throughout the superficial and deep dermis, which is consistent with PTLD. The presence of crushed but markedly atypical-appearing lymphoid cells with nuclear hyperchromasia and scant amounts of cytoplasm, as well as multiple mitotic and apoptotic figures, also supports this diagnosis.

Reactive granulomatous disorder (choice A) is an inflammatory condition that can occur in response to various stimuli, including infections, tumors, and foreign bodies. While the patient's skin biopsy shows some inflammation, the presence of atypical lymphoid cells and the annular configuration encircling the OLT scar suggest that the patient's condition is more likely to be a malignancy rather than a reactive process.

Deep fungal infection (choice C) is a possible complication of immunosuppression, but the patient's symptoms and skin biopsy findings are not consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's skin biopsy does not show any evidence of fungal infection, and the patient's history of PTLD suggests that the patient is more likely to have a malignancy than an infection.

Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (choice D) is a type of cancer that affects the skin and can occur in patients with a history of immunosuppression. However

Sure, I'd be happy to explain why C. X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is the correct answer and why the other choices are incorrect.

**Answer**: C. X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease

X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX) is a type of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, which is a group of inherited disorders that affect the peripheral nervous system. CMTX is caused by mutations in the Connexin 32 gene, which is located on the X chromosome. It is characterized by progressive loss of motor and sensory function in the limbs, as well as muscle weakness and atrophy.

The patient in the case presentation has a history of gait abnormalities, including pes planovalgus (a condition where the foot is flat and the toes are pointed outward) and tight achilles tendons bilaterally. These symptoms are consistent with CMTX, which can cause muscle weakness and atrophy in the legs. The patient also has decreased vibratory and fine touch sensation from the great toe up to the mid shin bilaterally, which is consistent with sensory loss, another common symptom of CMTX.

The patient's family history is also consistent with CMTX. His mother has diminished reflexes, hand tremor, and balance issues, which are all symptoms of CMTX. Additionally, the patient's younger brother has similar gait abnormalities, which suggests that the condition may be inherited.

The other choices are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and family history.

A. Mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the brain and nervous system. It is characterized by recurrent stroke-like episodes, seizures, and muscle weakness. While the patient in the case presentation has had stroke-like episodes, the other symptoms of MELAS are not present.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is D. Initiate intravenous penicillin therapy.

The patient's symptoms of bilateral blurry vision, along with the physical examination findings of mild vitritis, mild hyperemia of the right optic nerve, and a large white lesion that encompasses the nerve and macula of both eyes, are consistent with a diagnosis of uveitis. The laboratory workup results showing a mildly reactive fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test suggest that the uveitis may be caused by syphilis.

Initiating intravenous penicillin therapy is the appropriate next step in management, as it is the treatment of choice for syphilitic uveitis. Penicillin is effective in treating the underlying infection and reducing inflammation in the eye.

The other options are not appropriate for several reasons:

A. Perform bilateral posterior sub-Tenon triamcinolone injections: While corticosteroid injections can be used to treat uveitis, they are not the first line of treatment for syphilitic uveitis. In addition, the patient's symptoms have been rapidly worsening, and corticosteroid injections may not be effective in halting the progression of the disease.

B. Increase the dose of oral prednisone: As mentioned above, corticosteroids may not be effective in treating syphilitic uveitis, and increasing the dose of oral prednisone may not be sufficient to control the disease.

C. Initiate antiviral therapy: There is no indication that the patient has a viral infection, and antiviral therapy would not be effective in treating syphilitic uveitis.

Therefore, the best next step in management would be to initiate intravenous penicillin therapy to treat the underlying syphilis infection and reduce inflammation in the eye.

**Answer**:C. Obtain cerebral magnetic resonance venography or computed tomographic venography

The correct answer is C. Obtain cerebral magnetic resonance venography or computed tomographic venography. The patient's symptoms of bilateral papilledema and progressive visual loss in the right eye, along with the finding of partially empty sella on MRI, suggest the possibility of a venous sinus thrombosis or other vascular abnormality. This would explain the patient's symptoms and the absence of any other neurological symptoms.

Option A, adding immunosuppressant to corticosteroid therapy, may be appropriate for the patient's Behçet disease, but it would not address the underlying cause of her visual symptoms.

Option B, increasing the prednisone dose, may help reduce inflammation, but it would not specifically address the venous sinus thrombosis or other vascular abnormality that is suspected.

Option D, performing catheter cerebral angiography, would provide more detailed information about the blood vessels in the brain, but it would be an invasive procedure and may not be necessary at this stage.

Therefore, option C, obtaining cerebral magnetic resonance venography or computed tomographic venography, is the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation. This non-invasive test would provide valuable information about the venous circulation in the brain and help confirm or rule out the diagnosis of venous sinus thrombosis or other vascular abnormality.

**Answer**:A. Obtain a family medical history and genetic testing

The correct answer is A, "Obtain a family medical history and genetic testing," because it is crucial to rule out any underlying genetic disorders that may be related to the development of bilateral atypical epiretinal membranes in an 8-year-old girl. The patient's history of bilateral lateral rectus muscle recession for exotropia and a residual intermittent exotropia of 4 prism diopters bilaterally suggests that there may be a genetic predisposition to eye movement disorders or other conditions that could be associated with the development of these membranes.

Furthermore, the patient's age and the presence of bilateral lesions suggest that this may be a developmental or congenital condition, which could also be related to genetic factors. Obtaining a family medical history and genetic testing can help identify potential genetic causes and guide further management and counseling for the patient and her family.

In contrast, choice B, "Recommend pars plana vitrectomy with epiretinal membrane peel," may be a reasonable treatment option for symptomatic bilateral atypical epiretinal membranes, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management. It is important to first determine the underlying cause of the membranes and consider potential genetic factors before proceeding with surgical intervention.

Choice C, "Observe the lesions," may be appropriate for some cases of atypical epiretinal membranes, but it is not the most appropriate choice in this case given the patient's young age and the presence of bilateral lesions. Closer monitoring and follow-up may be necessary to ensure that the lesions do not progress and cause visual symptoms.

Choice D, "Give an intravitreal ocriplasmin injection," is not a relevant treatment option for atypical epiretinal membranes. Ocriplasmin is a drug used to treat vitreomacular traction and does not have a role in the management of epiretinal membranes.

**Answer**:B. Conjunctival biopsy

The patient's symptoms of ptosis and blurred vision, along with the physical examination findings of a solid, superior bulbar conjunctival mass, suggest a possible diagnosis of a conjunctival lesion. The appropriate next step in management would be to perform a conjunctival biopsy to determine the nature of the lesion. This would help guide further management and treatment.

Topical corticosteroid eyedrops (Option A) may be used to treat inflammatory conditions of the conjunctiva, but they would not be effective in diagnosing the underlying cause of the lesion.

Complete blood cell count, basic metabolic panel, and liver function tests (Option C) may be useful in evaluating the patient's overall health and identifying potential systemic associations or causes of the conjunctival lesion, but they are not directly related to the patient's primary complaints or physical examination findings.

Serum and urine electrophoresis (Option D) are not typically used in the evaluation of conjunctival lesions and would not provide useful information in this case.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Conjunctival biopsy.

**Answer**: D. Obtain serum vitamin A levels

Explanation:
The patient's history of long-term alcoholism and recent trauma to the left eye suggests that the nonhealing corneal ulcer may be related to malnutrition, immunosuppression, and/or delayed wound healing. Vitamin A plays a critical role in epithelial healing and immune function, and deficiency can lead to impaired wound healing and increased susceptibility to infections. Obtaining serum vitamin A levels can help identify a potential deficiency and guide appropriate supplementation.

A: Use confocal microscopy to evaluate for cysts.
This choice is incorrect because while confocal microscopy can help diagnose corneal cysts, it is not directly related to the patient's symptoms or history. The patient's nonhealing corneal ulcer and history of alcoholism suggest a more systemic issue, making confocal microscopy less relevant at this stage.

B: Obtain herpes simplex virus tissue culture and antigen detection tests.
This choice is incorrect because there is no indication of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection in the patient's history or clinical presentation. While HSV can cause corneal ulcers, the patient's history of trauma and alcoholism suggests a different etiology.

C: Broaden antibiotic coverage to include vancomycin and tobramycin.
This choice is incorrect because the patient's cultures were negative, and there is no indication of bacterial infection. Additionally, broadening antibiotic coverage without a clear indication can contribute to antibiotic resistance and may not address the underlying cause of the nonhealing ulcer.

**Answer**: D. Basal cell carcinoma

The correct answer is D. Basal cell carcinoma because it is a type of skin cancer that commonly occurs in areas of previous radiation exposure. The patient's history of radiation therapy for medulloblastoma and meningioma, as well as the location of the lesions within the radiation field, suggest an increased risk of developing basal cell carcinoma. The patient's family history of similar cutaneous lesions in two brothers and one niece also supports this diagnosis.

Angiosarcoma (choice A) is a rare and aggressive type of skin cancer that can occur in radiation-damaged skin, but it typically presents as a rapidly growing, painful, and bleeding nodule. The patient's lesions do not have these characteristics, and there is no mention of bleeding or pain.

Leukemia cutis (choice B) is a rare condition in which leukemic cells infiltrate the skin, causing the development of skin lesions. While the patient's history of radiation therapy does increase the risk of developing leukemia, there is no mention of systemic symptoms or a diagnosis of leukemia.

Squamous cell carcinoma (choice C) is a common type of skin cancer that can occur in radiation-damaged skin, but it typically presents as a firm, painless nodule or plaque. The patient's lesions do not have these characteristics, and there is no mention of a firm or painless nodule.

In summary, the patient's history of radiation exposure, the location of the lesions, and the family history of similar cutaneous lesions suggest that the most likely diagnosis is basal cell carcinoma.

**Answer**:B. Nivolumab-induced extensive panniculitis

The patient's symptoms of progressive painful reddening and swelling of the left thigh, along with the clinical examination findings of diffuse erythematous induration and multiple small palpable subcutaneous nonindurated nodules on the ipsilateral gluteal region and leg, are consistent with panniculitis. The patient's history of melanoma and treatment with nivolumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, also support this diagnosis.

Panniculitis is a known side effect of immune checkpoint inhibitors, including nivolumab. It is an inflammatory condition that affects the subcutaneous tissue and can cause painful nodules, plaques, or ulcers on the skin. The patient's biopsy results showing a lobular lymphocytic panniculitis with a dense infiltrate of mainly lymphocytes and plasma cells, but no signs of vasculitis, further support this diagnosis.

The other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and findings. Disease progression (choice A) is unlikely given the patient's history of melanoma and treatment with nivolumab, which is typically effective in treating melanoma. Cold panniculitis (choice C) is also unlikely given the patient's symptoms of progressive painful reddening and swelling, which are not typical of cold panniculitis. Erythema nodosum under nivolumab (choice D) is a possible side effect of nivolumab, but it typically presents with painful, erythematous nodules on the shins, rather than the patient's symptoms of progressive painful reddening and swelling of the left thigh.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, clinical examination findings, and medical history, the most likely diagnosis is nivolumab-induced extensive panniculitis.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

**Answer**: B. Start intravenous heparin

The correct answer is B, Start intravenous heparin, because the patient has acute shortness of breath due to a large thrombus on the mechanical mitral valve, which is likely causing acute mitral stenosis. Start intravenous heparin is the appropriate next step in managing this patient's condition.

Heparin is an anticoagulant that works by inhibiting the activity of thrombin, which is essential for the formation and growth of thrombi. By administering heparin, the physician aims to prevent further thrombus formation and to dissolve the existing thrombus on the mitral valve, thereby improving the patient's breathing and reducing the risk of further complications.

In contrast, the other options are not the most appropriate next steps in managing this patient's condition:

A. Refer the patient for aortic root dissection repair: While the patient does have a chronic dissection flap in the aortic arch and descending aorta, the immediate concern is the acute mitral stenosis caused by the thrombus on the mechanical mitral valve. Referring the patient for aortic root dissection repair would not address the immediate issue and could potentially delay appropriate treatment.

C. Administer a full dose of emergency tissue plasminogen activator: Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is a thrombolytic agent that is used to dissolve thrombi. However, it is typically used in emergency situations, such as acute myocardial infarction or stroke, and requires careful consideration and monitoring to avoid bleeding complications. In this case, starting intravenous heparin is a more appropriate first step, as it is a less invasive and less risky treatment option that can be easily monitored and adjusted as needed.

D. Perform emergency percutaneous clot removal: While percutaneous clot removal may be considered in some cases of acute mitral stenosis, it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's case. The patient has a mechanical mitral valve, which increases the risk of complications

**Answer**: D. Sebaceous carcinoma

The patient's symptoms and test results indicate that the most likely diagnosis is sebaceous carcinoma. The patient's age, gender, and history of tobacco use are consistent with the demographics of patients who typically develop sebaceous carcinoma. The mass's location in the right supraorbital region and its destruction of the anterior table of the frontal sinus are also consistent with this diagnosis.

The patient's vision obstruction and the mass's firm, nonmobile, and nontender characteristics are also consistent with sebaceous carcinoma. Additionally, the presence of air within the mass (seen on the CT scan) is a common feature of sebaceous carcinoma.

The histopathological findings of large nests of neoplastic epithelioid cells surrounded by fibrotic tissue and necroinflammatory debris are also consistent with sebaceous carcinoma. The neoplastic cells' round nuclei with single prominent nucleoli and abundant clear to vacuolated cytoplasm are also characteristic of sebaceous carcinoma.

Now, let's discuss why the other answer choices are incorrect:

A. Pott puffy tumor: Pott puffy tumors are benign, slow-growing tumors that typically affect the scalp and are usually seen in children and young adults. They are rare in the orbit and are not typically associated with destruction of the anterior table of the frontal sinus.

B. Mucocele: Mucocele is a benign tumor that arises from the mucoid tissue of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. It is usually slow-growing and painless, and does not typically cause vision obstruction or destroy bone.

C. Basal cell carcinoma: Basal cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that typically affects the skin of the head and neck. It is rare in the orbit and is not typically associated with destruction of the anterior table of the frontal sinus.

**Answer**: D. Schistosomiasis

The patient's symptoms of progressive left hearing loss, vertigo, asthenia, sleep disorders, and urinary frequency, along with the physical examination findings of right horizontal nystagmus, poorly delineated hypoesthesia of the left pinna, and absence of otoacoustic emissions on the left side, are consistent with a diagnosis of schistosomiasis. Schistosomiasis is a parasitic infection caused by Schistosoma worms, which can affect various organs in the body, including the brain and inner ear. The patient's history of swimming in Lake Tanganyika, where schistosomiasis is endemic, increases the likelihood of this diagnosis.

The patient's urinary frequency, which has been treated for 2 years without improvement, may be related to schistosomiasis, as the parasite can cause bladder and urinary tract symptoms. The presence of a 24 × 20-mm hemorrhagic lesion in the left middle cerebellar peduncle and a thickening of the cochleovestibular nerve, as well as the absence of acoustic reflex on the left side, are consistent with schistosomiasis-related central vertigo.

The patient's referral to urology and the discovery of a 13 × 8-mm mass in the lateral wall of the prostate gland may be related to schistosomiasis, as the parasite can cause genitourinary symptoms. However, the size and location of the mass suggest that it may be a separate entity, such as a prostate adenoma or carcinoma.

The other answer choices are less likely to be the correct diagnosis for this patient's symptoms and findings.

A. Prostate cancer with brain metastasis: While the patient's age and the presence of a mass in the prostate gland may suggest a possibility of prostate cancer, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are not consistent with metastasis to the brain.

**Answer**:B. Lupus vulgaris

Lupus vulgaris is a chronic skin condition characterized by the formation of papules, nodules, and plaques on the skin, often with a butterfly distribution on the face. The patient's symptoms of reddish, raised lesions over the right ear and multiple painless swellings on the ipsilateral side of the neck, as well as the presence of firm, nontender posterior cervical lymphadenopathy, are consistent with lupus vulgaris. The histopathological examination findings of granulomatous inflammation and central caseous necrosis in the dermis, as well as the positive Ziehl-Neelsen stain for acid-fast bacilli, support the diagnosis of lupus vulgaris.

A. Fixed cutaneous sporotrichosis is a chronic fungal infection that presents with verrucous lesions on the skin, often on the extremities. While the patient's lesions do have a verrucous appearance, the location on the ear and neck, as well as the absence of any history of trauma or intervention prior to the onset of lesions, makes this diagnosis less likely.

C. Atypical mycobacterial infection can cause a variety of skin lesions, including papules, nodules, and plaques. However, the patient's lesions do not have the characteristic features of atypical mycobacterial infection, such as a painless, slowly growing mass or ulcer. Additionally, the presence of granulomatous inflammation and acid-fast bacilli on histopathological examination is not consistent with atypical mycobacterial infection.

D. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a parasitic infection that can cause skin lesions, including papules, nodules, and plaques.

**Answer**:B. Obtain additional imaging with computed tomography (CT)

The correct answer is B because the patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a possible diagnosis of meningitis or encephalitis, which cannot be confirmed by MRI alone. Computed tomography (CT) imaging can help to identify any intracranial abnormalities, such as abscesses or inflammation, that may not be visible on MRI. Additionally, CT imaging can provide information about the bony structures of the skull and sinuses, which may be useful in determining the cause of the patient's headache and neck stiffness.

Choice A, continuing intravenous antibiotics, may be appropriate for treating bacterial meningitis, but it does not address the need for further diagnostic testing to confirm the diagnosis.

Choice C, starting gabapentin, is not relevant to the patient's current symptoms and diagnosis. Gabapentin is typically used to treat neuropathic pain, seizures, and anxiety disorders.

Choice D, starting high-dose ibuprofen, may be appropriate for treating headache and fever, but it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that can help to reduce pain and inflammation, but it is not effective in treating bacterial infections.

**Answer**: D. Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP)

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a possible diagnosis of giant cell arteritis (GCA), which is a vasculitis that affects the medium and large arteries, including the temporal arteries. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 110 mm/h is significantly elevated, which supports the diagnosis of GCA. However, the temporal artery biopsy result showed a normal caliber lumen without infiltrating inflammatory cells, which suggests that the patient may not have GCA.

In this scenario, it is important to consider other possible causes of the patient's symptoms and laboratory results. One possible diagnosis is a polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), which is a condition that often presents with similar symptoms and laboratory results as GCA. PMR is characterized by inflammation of the muscles and joints, and it can also cause elevated ESR.

Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) is a test that can help differentiate between GCA and PMR. SPEP measures the levels of different proteins in the blood, including the inflammatory markers, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). In GCA, SPEP typically shows an elevated ESR and a positive CRP. In PMR, SPEP typically shows a normal ESR and a positive CRP.

Therefore, option D, Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP), is the correct answer. It can help to differentiate between GCA and PMR, and guide further management.

Option A, Brain magnetic resonance imaging, may be useful in evaluating the patient's symptoms of headache and blurred vision, but it is not directly related to the patient's elevated ESR and suspected diagnosis of GCA or PMR.

Option B, Empirical methotrexate prescription, is not appropriate at this stage, as the diagnosis is not confirmed, and methotrexate is a medication that is typically used to treat GCA, but

The patient's symptoms of lip enlargement with nodular growths, extending onto the vermilion border, and the presence of intraepithelial lymphocytic infiltrate on biopsy, are consistent with leukemia labialis.

Granulomatous cheilitis, option A, is a rare inflammatory condition of the lips, characterized by the formation of granulomas. While it can present with similar symptoms, such as lip swelling and nodularity, it is not associated with hematological malignancies.

Lip licker's dermatitis, option C, is a common condition characterized by dry, scaly, and crusted lesions on the lips, caused by excessive licking of the lips. It is not associated with hematological malignancies and does not present with nodular or papillomatous lesions.

The correct answer is C. Erdheim-Chester disease, as it is a rare benign clinical condition characterized by the accumulation of lipid-laden histiocytes, which can cause a variety of symptoms, including abdominal and back pain, and can lead to complications such as ureteral obstruction, chronic kidney disease, and lymphedema, as seen in the case. The patient's clinical presentation, imaging findings, and histopathological features, including foamy histiocytes with Touton giant cells, are consistent with Erdheim-Chester disease.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Necrobiotic xanthogranuloma is a rare condition characterized by the accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages and granulomas, usually in the context of chronic inflammation. While it can cause similar symptoms, it is not associated with retroperitoneal fibrosis or kidney complications.

B. Xanthelasma palpebrum is a benign condition characterized by the accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages in the eyelids, leading to the formation of yellow plaques. While it can cause cosmetic concerns, it is not associated with systemic symptoms or complications.

D. Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare condition characterized by the proliferation of Langerhans cells, which can cause a variety of symptoms, including skin rash, bone pain, and organ dysfunction. However, it typically affects children and young adults, and the histopathological features are distinct from those seen in Erdheim-Chester disease.

Therefore, based on the patient's clinical presentation, imaging findings, and histopathological features, the most likely diagnosis is Erdheim-Chester disease.

**Answer**:C. Eosinophilic pustular folliculitis (EPF)

The correct answer is C. Eosinophilic pustular folliculitis (EPF) because it matches the given case's symptoms. EPF is a skin condition where the skin develops pus-filled bumps (pustules) and inflamed hair follicles. The patient's described symptoms, such as pruritic hand dermatitis that spread to the face, trunk, upper extremities, and feet, and the physical examination findings of erythematous papules and pustules coalescing into large, partially indurated, and polycyclic plaques with centrifugal extension and occasional central clearing, are consistent with EPF.

In contrast, the other options do not align with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings:

A. Folliculotropic mycosis fungoides: This is a rare type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that typically presents with papules, plaques, and tumors on sun-exposed areas. While it may have some similarities with EPF, such as the presence of papules and plaques, it is a malignant condition, and the patient's history and physical examination do not suggest a malignancy.

B. Papulopustular rosacea: This is a type of rosacea that presents with papules and pustules on the face. While it may share some similarities with EPF, such as the presence of papules and pustules, it typically does not involve extrafacial areas, and the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a more widespread involvement.

D. Majocchi granuloma: This is a rare condition characterized by the formation of granulomas in response to a variety of stimuli. While it may present with papules and plaques, the presence of granulomas is a distinctive feature that is not mentioned in the patient's case.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, C. Eosinophilic pustular folliculitis (EPF) is the most appropriate diagnosis.

The correct answer is C. Susac syndrome because it matches the patient's symptoms and test results. Susac syndrome is a rare autoimmune disease that affects the blood-brain barrier and causes inflammation in the brain and retina. The patient's symptoms of transient right upper extremity weakness, word-finding difficulty, intermittent vertigo, and hearing loss are consistent with Susac syndrome. The patient's test results, including the brain MRI with gadolinium, which showed multiple white-matter lesions that were hyperintense on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and the lumbar puncture, which revealed a white blood cell count of 8 cells/μL, also support the diagnosis of Susac syndrome.

In contrast, the other answer choices do not match the patient's symptoms and test results as well.

A. Multiple sclerosis is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system, but it typically presents with symptoms such as vision loss, muscle weakness, and coordination problems, which are not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

**Answer**:B. Observe the patient

The correct answer is B. Observe the patient. The patient presents with sudden onset of photopsia and visual disturbances described as "fixed swirl circles" in the central vision of both eyes, which suggests a possible diagnosis of acute macular neuroretinopathy (AMN). The near-infrared reflectance imaging and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans of the right eye show hyporeflective teardrop-shaped lesions and increased reflectivity of the outer plexiform layer, which are consistent with AMN.

Given the patient's history of migraine and polycystic ovaries, it is possible that the visual symptoms are related to a migraine aura or a hormonal change. However, the presence of hyporeflective lesions on NIR imaging and OCT suggests that the cause of the visual symptoms is more likely to be related to a retinal condition, such as AMN.

Observing the patient is the appropriate next step, as it allows for close monitoring of the patient's condition and progression of the disease. This will help to determine if the patient's symptoms are due to a self-limiting process or if further intervention is needed. Additionally, observing the patient will give the clinician an opportunity to perform follow-up examinations and assess the effectiveness of any treatment that may be initiated.

Performing fluorescein angiography (choice A) may be useful in diagnosing retinal conditions, but it is not necessary at this point in the patient's care. The patient's symptoms and examination findings are already consistent with a diagnosis of AMN, and fluorescein angiography may not provide additional information that would change management.

Performing magnetic resonance imaging of the brain (choice C) may be considered in cases where the clinician suspects a central nervous system cause for the patient's symptoms, such as a stroke or a tumor. However, in this case, the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a retinal condition, and MRI of the brain is unlikely to provide useful information.

D. Draw a complete blood cell count with differential to evaluate for leukemic retinopathy or blood dyscrasia

**A**: Obtain a fluorescein angiogram to evaluate degree of ischemia and confirm a diagnosis of central retinal vein occlusion

The patient's symptoms of painless, blurry vision in the left eye, along with the physical examination findings of diffuse intraretinal hemorrhages and Roth spots, are consistent with a diagnosis of central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). A fluorescein angiogram can be used to evaluate the degree of ischemia and confirm the diagnosis, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management.

**B**: Provide the patient with stool softeners to prevent recurrence of Valsalva retinopathy

Valsalva retinopathy is a condition that occurs when there is a sudden increase in intraocular pressure due to increased intrathoracic pressure, such as during straining during bowel movements. The patient's history of petechiae and retinal hemorrhages suggests that they may have a bleeding disorder, but there is no evidence to suggest that they have Valsalva retinopathy. Providing stool softeners would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

**C**: Immediately begin intravenous antibiotics before any blood draws and consult cardiology for likely bacterial endocarditis

Endocarditis is an infection of the inner lining of the heart, and it can cause retinal hemorrhages and other ocular manifestations. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has endocarditis. The patient's history of fevers, night sweats, and chills suggests that they may have an underlying infection, but it is not appropriate to start intravenous antibiotics without further evaluation.

**Answer**:B. Biopsy the conjunctival and corneal lesion

The patient's symptoms and clinical findings suggest that he may have ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN) hiding in primary acquired melanosis (PAM). OSSN is a type of cancer that affects the surface of the eye and can be difficult to diagnose because it can mimic other conditions such as PAM.

Biopsy of the conjunctival and corneal lesion (choice B) is the most appropriate next step in diagnosing and managing the patient's condition. A biopsy can help to confirm the diagnosis of OSSN and determine the extent of the disease.

Referring the patient to an oncologist for metastatic workup (choice A) may be necessary if the biopsy confirms the diagnosis of OSSN, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this time.

Performing cryotherapy over the lesion (choice C) is not appropriate at this time, as it is not a diagnostic procedure and may not be effective in treating OSSN.

Starting oral doxycycline (choice D) is not a recommended treatment for OSSN and may not be effective in managing the patient's condition.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Biopsy the conjunctival and corneal lesion.

**Answer**: C. Proceed with conjunctival biopsy

The patient presented with asymptomatic follicular conjunctivitis, which is a chronic condition characterized by the presence of follicles on the conjunctiva. The patient had a history of soft contact lens wear, which could be a contributing factor to the development of follicular conjunctivitis. The patient was initially diagnosed with giant papillary conjunctivitis and was prescribed topical steroids, but the symptoms persisted after 3 months.

The correct answer is C. Proceed with conjunctival biopsy. A conjunctival biopsy would help to confirm the diagnosis of follicular conjunctivitis and rule out other possible causes of conjunctival lesions, such as conjunctival lymphoma or amyloidosis. The biopsy would also help to determine the presence of any underlying infection or inflammation.

The other answer choices are not the best options for several reasons:

A. Start an empirical trial of oral azithromycin: While oral antibiotics may be effective in treating bacterial conjunctivitis, they are not appropriate for follicular conjunctivitis, which is a chronic condition that is not caused by bacteria.

B. Start a longer trial of topical steroid with topical antihistamine: While topical steroids may be effective in reducing inflammation, they may not be effective in treating the underlying cause of follicular conjunctivitis. A longer trial of topical steroids may also increase the risk of side effects such as cataracts, glaucoma, and fungal infections.

D. Order chest radiography and an angiotensin-converting enzyme serum level test: These tests are not relevant to the patient's symptoms and would not help to confirm the diagnosis of follicular conjunctivitis. Chest radiography is used to diagnose lung diseases, while an angiotensin-converting enzyme serum level test is used to diagnose conditions such as sarcoidosis.

Therefore, the best answer is C. Proceed with

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is B: Examine the retinal periphery.

The patient presents with blurry vision in one eye, and the fundus examination reveals multiple refractile crystals scattered on the posterior pole. Optical coherence tomography shows these crystals to be located preretinally on the surface of the inner limiting membrane with sporadic crystals within the cortical vitreous. These findings are consistent with monocular crystalline maculopathy, a rare condition characterized by the accumulation of crystals in the retina.

Given the patient's symptoms and findings, it is important to examine the retinal periphery to rule out any other potential causes of his symptoms. The retinal periphery is the area outside the central part of the retina, and it is important to examine it to check for any signs of retinal detachment, retinal tears, or other retinal abnormalities that may be causing the patient's symptoms.

The other answer choices are not as relevant to the patient's symptoms and findings.

A: Request a genetic workup. While it is possible that the patient may have a genetic predisposition to monocular crystalline maculopathy, there is no indication in the patient's history or examination findings to suggest a genetic cause. A genetic workup may be considered later in the patient's management, but it is not the most appropriate next step.

C: Measure oxalate levels in blood and urine. Oxalate is a substance that can accumulate in the body and cause crystallization in various tissues, including the retina. However, there is no indication in the patient's history or examination findings to suggest that oxalate levels are elevated. Measuring oxalate levels may be considered later in the patient's management, but it is not the most appropriate next step.

D: Screen for intravenous abuse of opioids and other substances. The patient's symptoms and findings do not suggest any evidence of substance abuse. While it is important to consider substance abuse as a potential cause of vision loss,

**Answer**: D. All of the above

Explanation:

A. Control the systemic blood pressure and workup underlying possible cause of the hypertension:
This choice is incorrect because while controlling systemic blood pressure is important, it does not address the underlying cause of the optic nerve head edema. The patient's history of acute kidney failure and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction suggests a possible underlying systemic cause for the hypertension, which needs to be investigated further.

B. Perform blood tests for neuroretinitis:
This choice is incorrect because while blood tests may be useful in diagnosing certain conditions, they are not specific for the diagnosis of optic nerve head edema. The patient's symptoms and ophthalmic examination findings are more consistent with a diagnosis of optic nerve head edema, which requires further evaluation with imaging studies.

C. Perform magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance venogram of the brain and orbits, then perform lumbar puncture:
This choice is incorrect because while MRI and MRI venogram can help evaluate the brain and orbits, they may not provide direct information about the optic nerve head edema. Lumbar puncture may be necessary to evaluate for conditions such as meningitis or encephalitis, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case.

D. All of the above:
This choice is correct because it includes all the necessary steps to evaluate and manage the patient's condition. The patient's hypertension needs to be controlled, and the underlying cause needs to be investigated. Imaging studies such as MRI and MRI venogram can help evaluate the brain and orbits, while lumbar puncture may be necessary to evaluate for conditions such as meningitis or encephalitis. Additionally, blood tests may be useful in diagnosing certain conditions. Therefore, all of the above choices are necessary to provide appropriate care for the patient.

**Answer**:A. T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia

The patient's symptoms and test results point to T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia. The patient's erythematous macular eruption, generalized itch that worsens after a bath, high hemoglobin level, and lymphocytosis with reactive changes in the blood are all indicative of T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia. Additionally, the absence of cellular atypia and epidermal involvement in the skin biopsy specimen, as well as the lack of leukocytoclastic vasculitis, fungal organisms, or dermal mucin, support this diagnosis.

In contrast, advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma/Sézary syndrome would typically present with more severe skin involvement, including erythroderma, and a higher risk of lymph node and blood involvement. Polycythemia rubra vera is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by a high hemoglobin level and red blood cell count, but it does not typically present with an erythematous macular eruption or lymphocytosis. Cutaneous lupus erythematosus would typically present with a malar rash, discoid lesions, and photosensitivity, and would not typically have a high hemoglobin level or lymphocytosis.

**Answer**: D. Coronary artery bypass graft surgery

The patient in this case has multiple coronary artery aneurysms with thrombosis, which suggests a high risk of cardiac events. The best course of action would be to perform coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) to restore blood flow to the affected areas.

A. High-dose corticosteroid therapy may be considered for the treatment of IgG4-related disease, but it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient. While corticosteroids may help reduce inflammation, they will not address the underlying issue of the aneurysms or thrombosis.

B. High-dose immunosuppressant therapy, like corticosteroids, may be considered for the treatment of IgG4-related disease, but it is also not the most appropriate choice for this patient. Immunosuppressants may help reduce inflammation, but they will not address the underlying issue of the aneurysms or thrombosis.

C. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may be considered for the treatment of coronary artery disease, but it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient. PCI typically involves the use of stents or balloons to open up blocked coronary arteries. However, in this case, the patient has multiple aneurysms with thrombosis, which makes PCI a higher-risk procedure. Additionally, PCI may not effectively address the underlying issue of the aneurysms.

Therefore, the best course of action would be to perform coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) to restore blood flow to the affected areas. This surgery involves taking a healthy blood vessel from another part of the body and using it to bypass the blocked or diseased coronary artery. This can help reduce the risk of cardiac events and improve the patient's overall prognosis.

**Answer**: D. Pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, as well as the results of the imaging study, are consistent with a diagnosis of pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma. This is a type of cancer that develops in the soft tissues of the body, such as muscles, tendons, and connective tissue.

The patient's age and gender also increase the likelihood of this diagnosis, as pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma typically affects adults in their 50s and 60s. Additionally, the location of the mass on the tongue and its proximity to the lingual septum are consistent with this diagnosis.

Squamous cell carcinoma (choice A) is a type of skin cancer that can occur in the oral cavity, but it typically presents with a different set of symptoms and physical examination findings. Oral eosinophilic ulcer (choice B) is a benign condition that can cause ulceration of the oral mucosa, but it does not typically cause a mass or have the same imaging features as pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma. Abscess (choice C) is a collection of pus that can occur in response to infection, but it does not typically cause a mass or have the same imaging features as pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and imaging results, the most likely diagnosis is pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma.

**Answer**:B. Gigantiform cementoma

The correct diagnosis is B. Gigantiform cementoma, as it best fits the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.

A. Albers-Schönberg disease is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of bones and teeth. It is characterized by multiple osseous lesions, but the presence of a nasolacrimal duct obstruction and the patient's history of chronic sinusitis do not support this diagnosis.

C. Fibrous dysplasia is a developmental disorder that affects the bones and can cause pain, swelling, and deformity. However, it typically affects the long bones, and the presence of a nasolacrimal duct obstruction and the patient's history of chronic sinusitis do not support this diagnosis.

D. Polyostotic ossifying fibroma is a rare benign tumor that affects the bones and can cause pain, swelling, and deformity. However, it typically affects the long bones, and the presence of a nasolacrimal duct obstruction and the patient's history of chronic sinusitis do not support this diagnosis.

In contrast, gigantiform cementoma is a rare benign tumor that affects the jaws and skull bones. It is characterized by the slow growth of a large, expansile, and sclerotic mass that can cause pain, swelling, and deformity. The patient's history of chronic sinusitis, the presence of a nasolacrimal duct obstruction, and the imaging findings of a dense, expansile, sclerotic mass obstructing the left nasolacrimal duct are consistent with a diagnosis of gigantiform cementoma. The histologic findings of a proliferation of highly cellular, fibrous connective tissue and cementum-like hard tissue also support this diagnosis. Therefore, B. Gigantiform cementoma is the correct answer.

**Answer**: C. Multifocal canalicular adenoma

The correct answer is C. Multifocal canalicular adenoma because it best matches the patient's symptoms and the results of the computed tomographic (CT) scan.

A. Multifocal basal cell adenoma is an incorrect choice because it is a rare benign tumor that typically affects the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses, not the upper lip. While it can present with multiple masses, the size and location of the masses in this case are not consistent with basal cell adenoma.

B. Basal cell adenocarcinoma is also an incorrect choice because it is a malignant tumor that typically presents with a slowly growing, painless mass in the skin or mucosa of the head and neck. While it can affect the lip, the patient's symptoms and the CT scan findings do not suggest a malignant tumor.

D. Adenoid cystic carcinoma is an incorrect choice because it is a rare malignant tumor that typically affects the salivary glands, not the lip. While it can present with multiple masses, the patient's symptoms and the CT scan findings do not suggest a malignant tumor.

In contrast, multifocal canalicular adenoma is a rare benign tumor that affects the salivary glands, particularly the parotid gland. It typically presents with multiple small masses that are located in the submucosa and do not cause any symptoms. The CT scan findings of hyperenhancing nodules without local bony erosion or cervical lymphadenopathy are consistent with this diagnosis. Therefore, C. Multifocal canalicular adenoma is the correct answer.

**Answer**: A. Biopsy the lesions

The correct answer is A, Biopsy the lesions, because it is the most appropriate next step in diagnosing and managing the patient's condition. A biopsy would allow for a histopathological examination of the skin lesions, which would help to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.

**Answer**: B. Prescribe oral valacyclovir

While valacyclovir may be effective in treating herpes zoster, it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient's condition. The patient's history of recurrent, painful skin lesions and the presence of vesicles and crusting suggest a different diagnosis, such as eczema or psoriasis. Oral valacyclovir would not be effective in treating these conditions, and may cause unnecessary side effects.

**Answer**: C. Prescribe topical cantharadin

Cantharadin is a topical agent used to treat molluscum contagiosum, a viral skin infection. However, it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient's condition, as the lesions do not have the characteristic appearance of molluscum contagiosum. Additionally, cantharadin can cause irritation and blistering, which may worsen the patient's symptoms.

**Answer**: D. Recommend a gluten-free diet

A gluten-free diet may be beneficial for patients with celiac disease or gluten sensitivity, but it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient's condition. There is no evidence to suggest that the patient has a gluten-related disorder, and a gluten-free diet would not address the underlying cause of the patient's skin lesions.

In summary, a biopsy is the most appropriate next step in diagnosing and managing the patient's condition, as it would allow for a histopathological examination of the skin lesions and guide further management.

**Answer**:B. Exploratory laparotomy

The patient's symptoms of severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and rebound tenderness, along with the CT scan findings of mesenteric vascular compromise, suggest a potentially life-threatening condition that requires immediate attention. Exploratory laparotomy is the most appropriate choice as it allows for a thorough evaluation of the patient's abdominal cavity and can help identify any potential causes of her symptoms, such as bowel obstruction, ischemia, or bleeding.

A. Esophagogastrojejunoscopy (EGD) is not appropriate in this case as it is used to visualize the upper gastrointestinal tract and would not provide a comprehensive view of the patient's abdominal cavity.

C. Highly selective mesenteric angiography (HSMA) may be useful in diagnosing mesenteric vascular compromise, but it is not the most appropriate choice in this case as it is an invasive procedure that carries risks and may not provide a complete picture of the patient's abdominal cavity.

D. Diagnostic laparoscopy may be a useful tool in evaluating the patient's abdominal cavity, but it is not as thorough as an exploratory laparotomy and may not provide a complete diagnosis. Additionally, it may not be feasible to perform a laparoscopy in an emergency situation where the patient is experiencing severe abdominal pain and vomiting.

**Answer**:A. Check serum trace element levels, including iron, copper, and zinc

The correct answer is A, "Check serum trace element levels, including iron, copper, and zinc," because the patient's pancytopenia and bone marrow aspirate findings suggest a possible diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), which is a group of disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis and a propensity for developing leukemia. MDS is often associated with genetic mutations, environmental exposures, and nutritional deficiencies, including trace element deficiencies.

Iron, copper, and zinc are essential trace elements that play critical roles in hematopoiesis, and their deficiencies can contribute to the development of MDS. Iron is necessary for the synthesis of hemoglobin, and copper is required for the synthesis of hematopoietic prostaglandins, which regulate hematopoiesis. Zinc is involved in the regulation of gene expression and cell signaling pathways that are critical for hematopoiesis.

Therefore, checking serum trace element levels, including iron, copper, and zinc, is a logical next step in the patient's evaluation, as it may help identify a potential contributing factor to his pancytopenia and guide further management.

In contrast, obtaining periodic outpatient complete blood cell counts and treating with supportive transfusions as clinically indicated (choice B) may help manage the patient's pancytopenia but does not address the underlying cause of the condition. Performing endoscopy of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract (choice C) may help diagnose gastrointestinal bleeding or other conditions but is not directly related to the patient's pancytopenia. Starting erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (choice D) may help improve the patient's anemia but may not address the underlying cause of the pancytopenia.

The correct answer is B. Cryothermic dermatitis artefacta, also known as frostbite dermatitis artefacta. This is a rare condition that is characterized by the formation of bullae and erythematous plaques on the skin, similar to the symptoms described in the case. The key feature that distinguishes cryothermic dermatitis artefacta from other conditions is the presence of a subepidermal blister, which is evident in the histopathologic specimen shown in Figure B.

The other answer choices are not correct for the following reasons:

A. Linear IgA bullous dermatosis: This is a rare autoimmune disorder that is characterized by the formation of large, tense bullae on the skin. While the presence of bullae may seem similar to the symptoms described in the case, the linear arrangement of the bullae and the presence of IgA deposits in the skin are distinctive features of this condition.

C. Herpes virus infection: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and herpes zoster virus (VZV) can cause a variety of skin lesions, including vesicles, pustules, and ulcers. However, the appearance of the lesions in this case, with central pallor and confluent blisters at the periphery, is not typical of herpes virus infections.

D. Bullous pemphigoid: This is a rare autoimmune disorder that is characterized by the formation of large, tense bullae on the skin. While the presence of bullae may seem similar to the symptoms described in the case, the bullae in bullous pemphigoid are typically larger and more widespread, and there is often a history of itching or burning sensations on the skin.

In summary, the correct answer is B. Cryothermic dermatitis artefacta, as it is the only condition that can explain the symptoms described in the case, including the presence of a subepidermal blister.

**Answer**: A. Prurigo pigmentosa (PP)

Prurigo pigmentosa (PP) is the correct diagnosis for the patient's symptoms. It is a rare, chronic skin condition characterized by the development of crusted, pruritic papules and nodules, often in a reticulate pattern. The patient's history of recurrent crops of pruritic erythematous papules that subsided leaving behind brownish-bluish black hyperpigmentation after each episode, as well as the presence of reticulate patterns on the neck, axillae, antecubital fossa, and intermammary and inframammary areas, are consistent with PP.

The patient's age and absence of a family history of similar lesions also support the diagnosis of PP. Additionally, the histopathological findings of mild epidermal hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, multiple foci of spongiosis, and an enhanced basal layer pigmentation, as well as scant lichenoid and moderate perivascular lymphomononuclear and polymorphonuclear infiltrate, basal cell vacuolization, and melanin incontinence, are consistent with PP.

Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis (A), also known as confluent and reticulated papillomatosis of Gougerot and Carteaud, is a rare skin condition characterized by the development of numerous, small, brown or skin-colored papules that coalesce to form larger, reticulated plaques. While the reticulate pattern and pigmentation may be similar to PP, the patient's history and histopathological findings do not support this diagnosis.

Prurigo nodularis (B), also known as prurigo pigmentosa nodularis, is a rare variant of PP that is characterized by the development of nodules rather than papules. While the patient's history of pruritic erythematous papules that subsided leaving behind brownish-bluish black hyperpigmentation may be consistent with PP, the presence of nodules would be unusual in PP.

**Answer**:B. Cystic fibrosis-associated episodic arthritis

The correct answer is B, Cystic fibrosis-associated episodic arthritis, because it aligns with the patient's symptoms and medical history. The patient has a history of cystic fibrosis, and the episodic nature of the arthritis, cutaneous eruption, and joint pain are consistent with CF-associated arthritis. The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and medical history:

A, Systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis, does not align with the patient's medical history or symptoms. While this condition can cause joint pain and swelling, it typically affects children under the age of 16, and the patient in this case is an elementary school-aged girl. Additionally, the patient's symptoms are episodic, which is not consistent with the persistent joint symptoms seen in systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis.

C, Hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy, is a complication of cystic fibrosis that affects the joints, but it typically affects the hands and feet, not the wrist, knee, and ankle joints as seen in this patient. Additionally, the patient does not have any signs of lung disease, which is a hallmark of hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy.

D, Serum sickness-like reaction, is a rare complication of cystic fibrosis that can cause joint pain and swelling, but it typically occurs in response to antibiotic use, which is not mentioned in the patient's history. Additionally, the patient's symptoms are not consistent with the typical symptoms of serum sickness-like reaction, which include fever, rash, and lymphadenopathy.

Therefore, the best answer is B, Cystic fibrosis-associated episodic arthritis, as it aligns with the patient's symptoms and medical history.

**Answer**: C. Diabetic striatopathy

The correct answer is C. Diabetic striatopathy because it is a complication of type 2 diabetes that can cause chorea, which is a type of involuntary movement disorder. The patient's history of type 2 diabetes for over 10 years, along with the presence of neuropathy and retinopathy, suggests that they have had a long-standing diabetic condition. The patient's symptoms of persistent chorea in the left upper extremity, despite aggressive correction with insulin, also support this diagnosis.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Postinfectious/autoimmune chorea: This diagnosis is unlikely because the patient does not have a history of recent infections, and there is no evidence of cognitive impairments or other neurological symptoms that would suggest an autoimmune disorder.

B. Paraneoplastic chorea: This diagnosis is unlikely because there is no evidence of cancer or a paraneoplastic syndrome in the patient's history.

D. Acute stroke: This diagnosis is unlikely because the patient's symptoms of chorea do not suggest a sudden, acute neurological event such as a stroke. Additionally, the patient's vital signs and laboratory results, including a normal electrolyte and toxicology panel, do not support this diagnosis.

Therefore, based on the patient's history and symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is C. Diabetic striatopathy.

**Answer**: B. Perform scleral biopsy

The patient in this case has chronic eye redness and pain that has not responded to anti-inflammatory therapy, including high-dose intravenous corticosteroids and currently prescribed topical corticosteroids given 4 times daily in both eyes. The patient's history of asthma, pneumonia, myocarditis, and hypereosinophilic syndrome suggests a possible underlying autoimmune or inflammatory condition that may be contributing to the ocular symptoms.

Performing a scleral biopsy (choice B) would allow for a tissue sample to be collected and examined for signs of inflammation, infection, or other abnormalities that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. This would help to determine the underlying cause of the patient's chronic eye redness and pain, which would inform further treatment decisions.

In contrast, increasing oral corticosteroids dosage to 40 mg daily (choice A) may provide some temporary relief for the patient's symptoms, but it would not address the underlying cause of the inflammation. The patient has already been on high-dose corticosteroids in the past without improvement, suggesting that further increasing the dosage may not be effective.

Increasing to hourly topical corticosteroid use (choice C) may also provide some temporary relief, but it would not address the underlying cause of the inflammation and may lead to side effects such as thinning of the skin and increased risk of infection.

Increasing azathioprine dosage to 500 mg daily (choice D) may be a reasonable option for treating an autoimmune or inflammatory condition, but it would not address the underlying cause of the patient's ocular symptoms and may take several weeks to months to show effect.

Therefore, performing a scleral biopsy (choice B) is the most appropriate next step in the patient's management.

**Answer**:A. Optical coherence tomography angiography

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of central scotoma and blurry vision in her right eye, along with the physical examination findings of pseudophakia and mild cataract, suggest a possible retinal vascular disorder. The SD-OCT scan shows segmental atrophy of the inner retina, which supports this diagnosis. To further evaluate the retinal circulation and identify any potential vascular abnormalities, the next step would be to perform optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). OCTA is a non-invasive imaging technique that uses motion contrast to visualize the retinal blood vessels and can help identify areas of vascular impairment.

The other options are not as appropriate for the patient's symptoms and examination findings:

B. Automated visual field testing would assess the patient's visual field, but it would not provide information about the retinal circulation.
C. Full-field electroretinogram (ERG) would assess the functional activity of the retina, but it would not provide information about the retinal circulation.

**Answer**:B. Recheck IOP with a handheld tonometer off the LASIK flap

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of decreased vision and shallow fluid interface between the stromal bed and the LASIK flap (arrowheads) indicate possible post-LASIK hypotony, which is characterized by low intraocular pressure (IOP) and often occurs due to a complication from LASIK surgery. The shallow fluid interface is suggestive of a possible leak in the LASIK flap, which can cause a decrease in IOP.

Option B, rechecking IOP with a handheld tonometer off the LASIK flap, is the most appropriate next step in management. This is because the current IOP reading of 6 mm Hg measured by GAT may not accurately reflect the true IOP due to the shallow fluid interface. A handheld tonometer can provide a more accurate reading of IOP by measuring the pressure directly under the LASIK flap, which is the likely source of the leak.

Option A, increasing the frequency of prednisolone administration to 6 times per day, may help reduce inflammation but is not directly addressing the possible leak in the LASIK flap.

Option C, injecting foscarnet sodium intravitreally, is not indicated in this case as there is no evidence of a viral infection.

Option D, reassuring the patient and rechecking IOP in 1 week, may not be the most appropriate next step as the patient's symptoms and signs suggest a more urgent need for intervention.

Therefore, the correct answer is B, rechecking IOP with a handheld tonometer off the LASIK flap.

**Answer**: C. Treat with oral corticosteroids

The correct answer is C. Treat with oral corticosteroids, as the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a diagnosis of uveitis, which is an inflammatory condition affecting the uvea, the middle layer of the eye. The patient's mild periorbital edema, low-grade eye pain, and trace eyelid edema are all consistent with uveitis. The solid gray mass in the macular region, with surrounding subretinal fluid, is also consistent with uveitis.

Uveitis is typically treated with oral corticosteroids, which can help reduce inflammation and prevent further damage to the eye. The use of oral corticosteroids is preferred over intra-arterial chemotherapy (choice A) or plaque radiotherapy (choice B) as they are less invasive and have fewer side effects. Intra-arterial chemotherapy and plaque radiotherapy are typically reserved for more advanced cases of uveitis that are unresponsive to oral corticosteroids or have features of malignancy.

Oral corticosteroids are also preferred over fine-needle aspiration biopsy (choice D) as the latter may not provide a definitive diagnosis and may be difficult to perform in a child.

Therefore, the best next step in management would be to treat the patient with oral corticosteroids, which is choice C.

The correct answer is B. Obtain additional imaging.

The patient presents with progressive proptosis, worsening vision, and tearing in the right eye, along with a firm, nontender mass palpable in the right superotemporal orbit. The computed tomographic scan of the orbits without contrast from an outside facility revealed a spherical mass of unclear cause in the area of the right lacrimal gland.

Given these findings, it is important to obtain additional imaging to further evaluate the mass and determine its cause. Option B, Obtain additional imaging, is the correct answer because it allows for a more thorough evaluation of the mass and its potential impact on the patient's symptoms.

Option A, Arrange 6-month follow-up, is not the correct answer because it does not address the patient's current symptoms or the mass that has been identified. While follow-up appointments can be useful for monitoring changes in the patient's condition, they do not provide a definitive diagnosis or treatment plan for the patient's current symptoms.

Option C, Perform an incisional biopsy, is also not the correct answer. An incisional biopsy involves making an incision in the skin to obtain a tissue sample, which can be risky and may not provide a definitive diagnosis. In this case, the patient's symptoms and the mass identified on imaging suggest that a more thorough evaluation is needed before considering a biopsy.

Option D, Perform an excisional biopsy, is also not the correct answer. An excisional biopsy involves removing a larger area of tissue, which can be even more risky than an incisional biopsy and may not be necessary at this stage of the patient's evaluation.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Obtain additional imaging to further evaluate the mass and determine the best course of action for the patient's treatment.

**Answer**:B. Magnetic resonance imaging and/or computed tomographic imaging of the orbits

The patient's symptoms of painless ptosis and intermittent diplopia in all gazes, along with the physical findings of mild anisocoria and full ductions and versions, suggest a possible diagnosis of a cranial nerve disorder. The absence of any relevant medical history, including ocular disease or trauma, and the normal intraocular pressures, make it unlikely that the ptosis is caused by a local ocular problem. The patient's history of resection of a benign thyroid mass 3 years prior, raises the possibility of a remote effect on the cranial nerves, specifically the oculomotor nerve.

Choice B, Magnetic resonance imaging and/or computed tomographic imaging of the orbits, is the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic workup. This imaging can help to identify any structural abnormalities in the orbits, such as a tumor or aneurysm, that may be affecting the oculomotor nerve and causing the ptosis and diplopia. MRI is the preferred imaging modality for evaluating the orbital soft tissues, while CT scan is better for evaluating bony structures.

Choice A, Check myasthenia laboratory findings and commence pyridostigmine trial, is not the most appropriate next step. Although myasthenia gravis is a possible cause of ptosis and diplopia, the absence of any other symptoms such as weakness or fatigue, and the normal pupillary reactions, make it less likely. Additionally, the patient's history of thyroid surgery, suggests a remote possibility of a postsurgical complication affecting the oculomotor nerve.

Choice C, Müller muscle conjunctival resection, is not appropriate at this stage of the diagnostic workup. This procedure is typically considered for patients with blepharoptosis, where the ptosis is caused by a dysfunction of the Müller muscle. In this case, the ptosis is likely caused by a cranial nerve disorder, and therefore, this procedure would not address the underlying cause.

**Answer**: B

The patient's symptoms of constant, bothersome sweating on the left forehead, along with the physical examination findings of a well-demarcated area of erythematous, perspiring skin on the left forehead, are consistent with hemifacial hyperhidrosis. This condition is caused by excessive sweating on one side of the face, usually due to compression or damage to the sympathetic nerve that controls sweating.

The patient's history of a large, 12-cm left upper lobe mass abutting the anterior chest wall pleura and extending into the mediastinum, with mediastinal lymphadenopathy, suggests that the tumor may have invaded or compressed the sympathetic nerve trunk, leading to hemifacial hyperhidrosis. This is supported by the radiation planning computed tomographic image taken 2 weeks after initial presentation, which shows growth of the left upper lobe tumor and compression of the sympathetic trunk (yellow contour) (Figure 1B).

Therefore, the correct answer is B, Impingement of the left sympathetic trunk.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A, C7 cervical spinal cord compression, is unlikely to cause hemifacial hyperhidrosis, as it would typically result in symptoms such as weakness or paralysis in the upper limbs, not sweating.

C, Right cervical ganglion invasion, is also unlikely, as the patient's symptoms are consistent with a lesion affecting the left sympathetic nerve, not the right.

D, Transection of the left sympathetic trunk, is not a likely explanation, as it would typically result in a complete loss of sweating on the left side of the face, rather than the excessive sweating (hemifacial hyperhidrosis) that the patient is experiencing.

I hope this explanation helps clarify the correct answer.

**Answer**:B. Electrophysiology study with possible catheter ablation

The patient in question has a history of hypertension and has been experiencing recurrent episodes of palpitations with near syncope, which led to the development of monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) with hemodynamic instability. The patient was successfully cardioverted and continued to have nonsustained monomorphic VT, indicating that the arrhythmia is likely originating from a specific location within the heart.

Option A, placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), may be considered for patients with a high risk of sudden cardiac death due to ventricular fibrillation or hemodynamically unstable VT. However, in this case, the patient's arrhythmia was successfully cardioverted, and there is no indication of a high risk of sudden cardiac death.

Option C, discharge with oral antiarrhythmic therapy with a class I or III agent, may be considered for patients with a lower risk of arrhythmia recurrence. However, in this case, the patient has a history of hypertension and has experienced recurrent episodes of palpitations with near syncope, indicating a higher risk of arrhythmia recurrence.

Option D, discharge with oral β-blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker, may be considered for patients with hypertension and/or angina. While the patient in question does have hypertension, the primary concern is the recurrent arrhythmia, which suggests a higher likelihood of a cardiac arrhythmia originating from a specific location within the heart.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to perform an electrophysiology study with possible catheter ablation to identify and target the specific location within the heart that is causing the arrhythmia. This approach can potentially cure the arrhythmia and prevent future episodes, which would be more effective than simply managing the symptoms with medication.

**Answer**: C. Mixed lymphatic and venous malformation

The patient's symptoms of a growing mass in the right oropharynx, causing changes in her voice, globus sensation, and dysphagia, as well as a 20-pound weight loss over 3 months and decreased appetite, are consistent with a benign tumor. The fact that the mass was partially obstructing the airway and compressing the epiglottis suggests that it was likely to be a slow-growing tumor.

The patient's age and lack of any associated symptoms such as fever, chills, rash, or night sweats also support the diagnosis of a benign tumor. Squamous cell carcinoma (choice A) is a malignant tumor that can occur in the tonsil, but it typically presents with more aggressive symptoms and signs, such as a rapidly growing mass, pain, and difficulty swallowing. Hemangioma (choice B) is a benign vascular tumor, but it is usually present at birth or appears in early childhood, and it does not typically cause the symptoms described in this case. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (choice D) is a malignant tumor that can occur in the tonsil, but it typically presents with more systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy.

The patient's history of a 4-month duration of symptoms and the physical examination findings of a large, partially obstructing mass in the right oropharynx, without any evidence of malignancy, support the diagnosis of a mixed lymphatic and venous malformation (choice C). This type of malformation is a congenital abnormality that can occur in the tonsil and can cause symptoms similar to those described in this case. The fact that the mass was continuous with the right tonsil also supports this diagnosis.

Therefore, based on the patient's history, physical examination findings, and the results of the surgical excision, the most likely diagnosis is a mixed lymphatic and venous malformation.

**Answer**: C. Neuroborreliosis cranial polyneuritis

The patient's symptoms of sudden onset of right facial nerve paralysis, followed by right-sided hearing loss, tinnitus, and intermittent otalgia, along with the MRI findings of abnormal linear and smooth enhancement of the right facial nerve in the superior distal IAC, labyrinthine segment, and geniculate ganglion, and discrete enhancement within the inferior aspect of the right IAC in the region of the vestibulocochlear nerve, are consistent with neuroborreliosis cranial polyneuritis.

Neuroborreliosis is a rare complication of Lyme disease, caused by the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi. It occurs when the bacteria spread to the nervous system, leading to inflammation and damage to the nerves. Cranial polyneuritis is a type of neuroborreliosis that affects the cranial nerves, including the facial nerve.

The patient's history of frequenting wooded areas and the empirical treatment with doxycycline suggest that Lyme disease was suspected. The MRI findings support this diagnosis, as the enhancement of the facial nerve and vestibulocochlear nerve are consistent with neuroborreliosis.

The other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and MRI findings.

A. Vestibular schwannoma: This is a benign tumor that grows on the vestibular nerve. It can cause symptoms such as hearing loss, tinnitus, and balance difficulties, but it would not explain the facial nerve paralysis or the MRI findings.

B. Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss: This is a condition where sudden hearing loss occurs without an identifiable cause. It does not explain the facial nerve paralysis or the MRI findings.

**Answer**:B. Cystic teratoma (mature)

The correct answer is B. Cystic teratoma (mature) because it best fits the patient's symptoms and imaging results described in the case.

A. Macrocystic lymphatic malformation: This is an incorrect choice because although lymphatic malformations can present with similar symptoms, such as swelling in the neck, they typically do not have a midline external punctum or a well-defined mass on imaging. Moreover, lymphatic malformations are usually diagnosed in the prenatal period or early infancy, whereas this patient presented at 1 week of age.

C. Foregut duplication cyst: This is an incorrect choice because foregut duplication cysts are rare congenital abnormalities that typically present with respiratory distress, cyanosis, and difficulty swallowing, which are not mentioned in the patient's history. Additionally, the location and size of the mass, as well as the absence of any other abnormalities, do not support this diagnosis.

D. Dermoid cyst: This is an incorrect choice because dermoid cysts are typically benign growths that contain skin cells, hair follicles, and sweat glands, which are not consistent with the patient's symptoms or imaging results. Moreover, dermoid cysts are usually located in the neck or face, whereas this patient's mass was located in the sublingual area.

In contrast, a cystic teratoma (mature) is a type of benign tumor that can occur in various locations, including the neck and face. It is composed of mature tissues, such as skin, fat, and muscle, which are present in the mass described in the case. The imaging results, including the bright signal on T2-weighted imaging and lack of enhancement with intravenous gadolinium, are also consistent with this diagnosis. Therefore, B. Cystic teratoma (mature) is the correct answer.

**Answer**:B. Alternative CFTR functional testing

The correct answer is B, Alternative CFTR functional testing, because the patient's sweat chloride testing results were indeterminate, and further testing is needed to confirm or rule out CF. The patient's negative 97-mutation CFTR analysis panel and whole-genome sequence analysis, which revealed one CF-causing mutation and two likely benign variants, suggest that the patient may have a rare or novel CF mutation that is not detected by standard genetic testing. Alternative CFTR functional testing, such as a nasal potential difference test or an intestinal current measurement, can help to determine if the patient's CFTR protein is functioning properly and can help to diagnose CF in patients with ambiguous genetic results.

In contrast, choice A, Additional genetic testing, may not be necessary at this point, as the patient has already undergone whole-genome sequence analysis, which has identified a CF-causing mutation. Choice C, Repeat sweat chloride analysis, may not be helpful, as the patient's previous sweat chloride tests were indeterminate, and repeating the test may not provide a different result. Choice D, No further testing; the patient does not have CF, is not supported by the patient's clinical presentation and test results, as the patient has a positive family history of CF and abnormal sweat chloride test results, suggesting that further testing is needed to confirm or rule out CF.

**Answer**:A. Initiate topical steroid eyedrop therapy

Topical steroid eyedrop therapy is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's condition. The patient's symptoms of blurry vision, ocular redness, and inflammation of the skin surrounding the tattoos suggest an inflammatory response. Topical steroids can help reduce inflammation and prevent further damage to the eye.

Choice B, recommending removal of the tattoos, may be considered later on if the patient's symptoms persist or worsen despite treatment, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this point.

Choice C, referring immediately to rheumatology, may also be considered if the patient's symptoms persist or worsen, as the condition may be related to a systemic autoimmune disorder. However, it is not the most appropriate next step before attempting to manage the patient's symptoms with topical steroids.

**Answer**:C. Perform skin scraping of burrows from multiple sites

The correct answer is C, Perform skin scraping of burrows from multiple sites, because it is the most appropriate next step in the evaluation of this patient's skin rash.

The patient's history of a widespread, papulopustulovesicular eruption that began as scattered papulovesicles over the chest, along with the presence of oval to elongated, serpiginous or J-shaped burrows, suggests the possibility of a parasitic infestation, such as scabies. Scabies is a highly contagious skin infection caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei, which burrows into the skin and lays eggs, leading to the characteristic rash.

Performing skin scraping of burrows from multiple sites can help to confirm the diagnosis of scabies by identifying the mite, eggs, or feces in the skin scrapings. This is a simple, quick, and non-invasive procedure that can be done in the clinic, and it can provide valuable information to guide further management.

Administering intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics (choice A) may be appropriate for bacterial infections, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as there is no evidence of a bacterial infection.

Starting a topical steroid (choice B) may be helpful in reducing inflammation and itching associated with the rash, but it is not the most appropriate next step in diagnosing the underlying cause of the rash.

Doing nothing and reassuring the parents (choice D) is not appropriate, as the patient's symptoms have been worsening over time, and a definitive diagnosis has not been made. It is important to further evaluate the patient and provide appropriate treatment to alleviate symptoms and prevent complications.

**Answer**: C. Pyoderma vegetans

Pyoderma vegetans is a rare bacterial infection that typically affects the skin, particularly the face, scalp, and extremities. It is characterized by the development of vegetating, bleeding, and ulcerating plaques, which are often painful and itchy. The patient's symptoms, such as the appearance of pustules and hemorrhagic-crusted plaques on the scalp, legs, arms, and trunk, as well as the difficulty with walking due to skin lesions, are consistent with pyoderma vegetans.

The patient's history of treatment with prednisolone, clindamycin, and fluconazole, without improvement, also supports this diagnosis. Pyoderma vegetans is known to be resistant to treatment with antifungal agents, and corticosteroids may even exacerbate the condition.

The histopathological findings, as shown in the image, demonstrate pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, dermal neutrophilia, and microabscesses with eosinophilia, which are all consistent with pyoderma vegetans.

In contrast, pyoderma gangrenosum (choice A) is a rare, ulcerative skin condition that is often associated with underlying conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, hematological malignancies, or autoimmune disorders. While it may present with similar symptoms, such as painful and itchy skin lesions, the absence of a history of underlying conditions and the presence of bleeding and ulcerating plaques on the scalp, legs, arms, and trunk, make pyoderma gangrenosum less likely.

Blastomycosis (choice B) is a fungal infection that can cause skin lesions, but it typically presents with smaller, more superficial lesions that are not as extensive as those seen in pyoderma vegetans. Additionally, blastomycosis does not typically cause the formation of vegetating plaques.

The correct answer is C. Atrophia maculosa varioliformis cutis because it matches the patient's symptoms and characteristics described in the case.

Atrophia maculosa varioliformis cutis is a rare skin condition characterized by the development of small, round or oval, shallow depressions on the skin, often on the face, with a scar-like appearance. The condition typically affects young adults, and the exact cause is unknown.

The patient in the case presented with several round atrophic lesions on his face, symmetric and bilateral, located on the malar and preauricular areas, with a diameter of 5 to 10 mm. The lesions were not indurated and displayed no epidermal changes. The patient denied experiencing previous inflammation and had no history of chicken pox or acne or traumatic lesions in those areas. These symptoms align with the characteristics of Atrophia maculosa varioliformis cutis.

The patient's history of IgA kappa multiple myeloma and the absence of other skin lesions or lymphadenopathy suggest a diagnosis of plasmacytoma. Plasmacytoma is a rare type of skin cancer that arises from plasma cells, which are a type of white blood cell found in the bone marrow. It typically presents as a solitary, slow-growing papule or nodule on the skin, often on the face, ears, or extremities. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with plasmacytoma.

A. Primary penile B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma is an aggressive type of cancer that affects the immune system. While it can present with a papule or nodule on the skin, it is typically associated with systemic symptoms such as fever, fatigue, and weight loss, which are not mentioned in the patient's history. Additionally, the patient's history of multiple myeloma and the absence of other skin lesions or lymphadenopathy make it less likely that this is a primary penile B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

B. Kaposi sarcoma of the penis is a rare type of cancer that affects the skin and lymphatic vessels. It typically presents with multiple, painless, red or purple lesions on the skin, often on the face, arms, or legs. The patient's solitary papule on the glans penis and the absence of other skin lesions make it less likely that this is a Kaposi sarcoma.

D. Primary nodular amyloidosis of the glans penis is a rare condition that is characterized by the accumulation of abnormal proteins in the tissues. It typically presents with a solitary, firm, painless nodule on the skin, often on the face or extremities.

**Answer**: A. Sliding hernia

The correct answer is A. Sliding hernia because it best matches the patient's symptoms and examination findings.

A sliding hernia, also known as a femoral hernia, occurs when a portion of the intestine or other tissue protrudes through a weakened area in the abdominal wall, typically on one side of the groin. This can cause pain and discomfort in the groin area, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms of right groin pain and difficulty voiding.

The patient's examination findings also support this diagnosis. The presence of a 5 cm × 3 cm palpable and partially reducible right groin mass that extends into the scrotum suggests a hernia. Additionally, the patient's leukocytosis and positive urinalysis results for Streptococcus viridians suggest a possible infection, which could be related to the hernia.

The other answer choices do not fit the patient's symptoms and examination findings as well.

B. Saphena varix is a rare condition characterized by a dilated, tortuous vein in the scrotum or groin area. While it can cause scrotal pain and swelling, it is not typically associated with a palpable mass or difficulty voiding.

C. Amyand hernia is a type of inguinal hernia that includes the appendix within the hernia sac. While it can cause groin pain and swelling, the presence of a palpable mass and difficulty voiding are not typical findings.

D. Communicating hydrocele is a condition in which there is a connection between the hydrocele sac and the peritoneal cavity, allowing fluid to flow between the two. While it can cause scrotal swelling, it is not typically associated with groin pain or difficulty voiding.

The correct answer is C. Ileo-colic intussusception.

Intussusception is a condition where a portion of the intestine slides into another portion, causing a blockage. In this case, the patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, vomiting, and elevated white blood cell count are consistent with intussusception. The fact that the patient is pregnant increases the likelihood of this diagnosis, as intussusception can occur more frequently during pregnancy due to hormonal changes and pressure on the intestines.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as diffuse abdominal tenderness, are also consistent with intussusception. The contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic CT scan shows an edematous small intestinal loop on the left abdomen, which is consistent with intussusception.

Now, let's discuss why the other answer choices are incorrect:

A. Crohn ileitis: This is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that affects the small intestine. While it can cause symptoms similar to intussusception, such as abdominal pain and diarrhea, it is not typically associated with vomiting or an elevated white blood cell count. Additionally, the patient's CT scan does not show any signs of inflammation or thickening of the intestinal walls, which are typical findings in Crohn's disease.

B. Foreign body ingestion: This occurs when a person swallows something that is not digestible, such as a coin or a button battery. While it can cause abdominal pain and vomiting, it is not typically associated with an elevated white blood cell count. Additionally, the patient's CT scan does not show any evidence of a foreign body.

D. Adenocarcinoma of small intestine: This is a type of cancer that affects the small intestine. While it can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain and weight loss, it is not typically associated with vomiting or an elevated white blood cell count.

**Answer**:B. Perform a vitreous tap and administer intravitreal injection of antifungal agents

The patient's symptoms of a new central scotoma in the right eye, sluggishly reactive pupil, and relative afferent pupillary defect suggest a possible diagnosis of fungal endophthalmitis. Fungal endophthalmitis is a sight-threatening infection that can occur after liver transplantation, especially in patients with a history of poorly controlled diabetes and hepatitis C. The patient's history of CMV IgG antibodies and undetectable CMV load 1 month before transplantation also increases the likelihood of fungal infection.

Option B, performing a vitreous tap and administering intravitreal injection of antifungal agents, is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's condition. The vitreous tap will allow for the identification of the causative organism, and the intravitreal injection of antifungal agents will provide prompt treatment for the fungal infection.

Option A, ordering brain neuroimaging and lumbar puncture, may be necessary later in the patient's management, but it is not the most appropriate next step. While the patient's symptoms could potentially be related to a central nervous system process, the presence of a relative afferent pupillary defect and sluggishly reactive pupil suggest a localized ocular process.

Option C, performing a vitreous tap and administering intravenous ganciclovir treatment, may also be considered, but intravitreal injection of antifungal agents is more targeted and effective for treating fungal endophthalmitis.

Option D, administering systemic steroid treatment, may be considered later in the patient's management if there is evidence of inflammation or uveitis, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this time.

The correct answer is C: Referral for cardiac biopsy.

The patient's symptoms of visual field changes and optic nerve edema, along with the fundus findings of peripapillary choroidal infiltrate, suggest a possible inflammatory or infectious process affecting the eye. However, the results of serology tests for various diseases, complete blood cell count, serum protein electrophoresis, and bone marrow biopsy were all negative or unrevealing. Additionally, the patient has a history of breast cancer and recent cardiac issues, with a right bundle branch block and complete heart block necessitating pacemaker implantation.

Given these findings, it is important to consider the possibility of a systemic inflammatory or infectious disease that could be affecting the eye, such as endocarditis or a cardiac tumor. A cardiac biopsy would be the appropriate next step to help diagnose or rule out such a condition, as it would allow for histopathological examination of the heart tissue.

The other options are not as appropriate for the following reasons:

A: Chorioretinal biopsy would not be helpful in diagnosing a potential systemic condition, as it would only provide information about the localized area of the retina and choroid.

B: Observation would not be appropriate given the patient's symptoms and findings, as it would not provide any definitive answers or guide treatment.

D: Oral corticosteroid therapy would not be appropriate at this time, as there is no definitive diagnosis to support its use, and it could potentially mask symptoms and make it more difficult to diagnose the underlying condition.

Therefore, the best next step would be to refer the patient for a cardiac biopsy to help determine the underlying cause of their symptoms and findings.

**Answer**:B. Order a computed tomographic scan of the orbits

The patient's symptoms of progressively worsening vision, binocular diplopia, and limited extraocular motility, along with the physical findings of bilateral proptosis, increased resistance to retropulsion, and chorioretinal folds, suggest a possible orbital mass or inflammation. An urgent CT scan of the orbits is the next step in the diagnostic workup to confirm the presence of an orbital mass or inflammation and to guide further management.

Option A, Perform an orbital biopsy, is not the next step in the diagnostic workup. While an orbital biopsy may be necessary in some cases, it is not urgently needed in this case, and a CT scan is a more appropriate first step.

Option C, Obtain a consultation from the retina service, may be appropriate later in the management of the patient's condition, but it is not the most urgent step in the diagnostic workup.

Option D, Perform emergency canthotomy and cantholysis to decompress the orbits, is not appropriate at this time. While this procedure may be necessary in some cases of orbital compartment syndrome, it is not indicated based on the patient's current symptoms and physical findings.

**Answer**:B. Orbitotomy with biopsy

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of acute onset of painful proptosis and periorbital edema in both eyes, along with the absence of any inciting trauma, suggest a possible diagnosis of bilateral sequential acute proptosis. This is a rare condition that can be caused by various factors, including inflammatory, infectious, or neoplastic processes.

Given the patient's history of hypertension and opiate abuse, it is important to consider the possibility of an underlying systemic condition that may be contributing to the proptosis. However, the absence of any other symptoms or signs suggestive of a systemic condition, along with the presence of periorbital edema and limitation in supraduction, abduction, and adduction in both eyes, suggests that the proptosis is more likely to be caused by an orbital process.

The laboratory workup, including the elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and positive results for anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies, suggests the possibility of an autoimmune disorder. However, the negative results of further autoimmune and infectious workup make it less likely that the proptosis is caused by an autoimmune or infectious process.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to perform an orbitotomy with biopsy to establish a definitive diagnosis. This would allow for a targeted approach to treatment, based on the underlying cause of the proptosis.

Empirical corticosteroid treatment (choice A) may be considered, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management, as it does not provide a definitive diagnosis and may not be effective in treating the underlying cause of the proptosis.

External beam radiotherapy (choice C) is not appropriate, as there is no evidence to suggest that the proptosis is caused by a malignancy.

Intravenous antibiotic therapy (choice D) is also not appropriate, as there is no evidence to suggest that the proptosis is caused by an infection.

**Answer**:A. Recommend intravitreal anti–VEGF injection.

Explanation:

A. Recommend intravitreal anti–VEGF injection:

The patient's symptoms and examination results suggest the presence of retinal exudates and hemorrhages, which can be caused by various conditions, including diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and retinal vein occlusion. The patient's history of breast cancer and tamoxifen use increases the likelihood of a tumor-related etiology.

Intravitreal anti-VEGF injection is a common treatment for retinal exudates and hemorrhages caused by various conditions, including diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration. Anti-VEGF medications work by blocking the growth of new blood vessels and reducing the amount of fluid in the retina, which can help improve vision and prevent further damage.

Therefore, option A is the most appropriate choice, as it addresses the patient's symptoms and underlying condition effectively.

B. Recommend continued blood glucose control and consider intravitreal anti–VEGF injection or focal laser treatment if the macular edema persists:

This option is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and examination results suggest the presence of retinal exudates and hemorrhages, rather than macular edema. While continued blood glucose control is important for managing diabetic retinopathy, it may not effectively address the patient's current symptoms.

C. Explain to the patient that these changes are medication-associated and recommend close observation:

This option is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and examination results suggest the presence of retinal exudates and hemorrhages, which may be caused by various conditions, including diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and retinal vein occlusion. While close observation is important for monitoring the patient's condition, it may not effectively address the underlying cause of the symptoms.

D. Recommend referral to the patient’s primary care physician for stricter blood pressure control:

This option is incorrect because

**Answer**:C. Magnetic resonance imaging of brain and orbits

The patient's symptoms of fluctuating left eye swelling and redness, along with the physical findings of a large subconjunctival hemorrhage and engorged episcleral veins, suggest a possible orbital vascular malformation. The patient's recent onset of left eye discomfort, tinnitus, and binocular horizontal diplopia also support this diagnosis.

Option C, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits, is the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation. MRI can help to confirm the presence of an orbital vascular malformation and identify any associated intracranial abnormalities. MRI can also help to rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a brain tumor or aneurysm.

Option A, Reassurance and artificial tears, is not appropriate at this time, as the patient's symptoms are persistent and worsening, and there is no clear cause for her symptoms. Artificial tears may provide some temporary relief for dryness or irritation, but they will not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

Option B, Computed Tomography (CT) of the head, may be useful in evaluating the patient's symptoms, but it is not the most appropriate next step. CT scans are better suited for evaluating bony structures and may not provide the same level of detail as MRI in evaluating soft tissue structures, such as blood vessels.

Option D, Urgently refer to neurosurgery, may be necessary depending on the results of the MRI, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this time. The patient's symptoms and physical findings suggest a possible orbital vascular malformation, which may be managed with observation, medical therapy, or interventional radiology procedures, rather than surgery. It is important to first obtain a definitive diagnosis and understand the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms before making a referral to neurosurgery.

**Answer**:C. Perform head/maxillofacial computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging

**Explanation**:

The patient's symptoms of worsening blurry vision and floaters in the left eye, along with the physical examination findings of mild fine keratic precipitates and pigmented cells, significant vitritis, and no obvious vascular sheathing or chorioretinal lesions, suggest a possible diagnosis of uveitis. Uveitis is a condition characterized by inflammation in the uvea, which can cause symptoms such as blurred vision, floaters, and eye pain.

The next step in the management of this patient would be to perform a head/maxillofacial computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to rule out any underlying causes of uveitis, such as a tumor or an abscess. This is the most appropriate choice among the options given, as it would help to identify any intracranial or orbital disease that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms.

Option A, observing the patient, may not provide enough information to determine the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and may lead to a delay in diagnosis and treatment.

Option B, starting topical or systemic steroids, may be considered as a treatment option for uveitis, but it is not the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient. Steroids may mask the symptoms, but they will not address the underlying cause of the uveitis.

Option D, performing vitreous biopsy, may be considered if the patient's symptoms persist or worsen despite treatment, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this point in the patient's management.

Therefore, the correct answer is C, Perform head/maxillofacial computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging.

**Answer**:C. Lichenoid drug reaction

The correct answer is C. Lichenoid drug reaction because the patient's symptoms and medical history are consistent with this diagnosis.

A. Secondary syphilis is an infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum, typically spread through sexual contact. The patient's history of syphilis and the appearance of papules and plaques on his feet are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the patient's history of cancer and use of pembrolizumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, suggests that the skin eruptions may be related to an adverse effect of the medication rather than syphilis.

B. Lichen planus is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by the development of flat-topped, violaceous papules. While the patient's skin lesions have a similar appearance, the patient's history of cancer and use of pembrolizumab suggests that the skin eruptions may be related to an adverse effect of the medication rather than lichen planus.

D. Janeway lesions are small, painless ulcers that occur on the palms and soles in association with endocarditis, an infection of the heart valves. While the patient's symptoms of ulcers on the buccal mucosa and penile ulcer are consistent with Janeway lesions, the patient's history of cancer and use of pembrolizumab suggests that the skin eruptions may be related to an adverse effect of the medication rather than endocarditis.

C. Lichenoid drug reaction is a skin reaction that occurs in response to certain medications, including pembrolizumab. The patient's history of cancer and use of pembrolizumab, as well as the appearance of lichenoid papules and plaques on the patient's feet, are consistent with this diagnosis. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

**Answer**: D. Transthoracic echocardiogram with a bubble study

The patient's history of atrial fibrillation, atrial septal defect (ASD), and ventricular septal defect (VSD) repair suggests a higher risk of infective endocarditis, which can lead to brain abscess formation. The presence of a right frontal lobe abscess with vasogenic edema on computed tomographic imaging of the brain further supports this diagnosis.

Therefore, the next step in management would be to perform a transthoracic echocardiogram with a bubble study to evaluate for any cardiac vegetations or abscesses that may have caused the brain abscess. This is the most appropriate choice among the options provided, as it can help confirm the diagnosis of infective endocarditis and guide further management.

In contrast, a transesophageal echocardiogram (choice A) may provide higher resolution images of the cardiac structures, but it is not necessary at this stage of management, and a transthoracic echocardiogram is sufficient to evaluate for cardiac vegetations.

Computed tomographic imaging of the chest (choice B) may be useful in evaluating for any pulmonary manifestations of infective endocarditis, such as nodules or abscesses, but it is not the most appropriate choice at this stage of management.

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (choice C) is a sensitive test for evaluating cardiac structures, but it is not typically used in the initial evaluation of infective endocarditis, and it may not provide the same level of detail as a transthoracic echocardiogram with a bubble study in this context.

**Answer**: C. Ectopic pituitary adenoma

The correct answer is C. Ectopic pituitary adenoma, as it best fits the patient's symptoms and imaging findings described in the case.

A. Squamous cell carcinoma is an unlikely diagnosis as it typically presents with a history of tobacco use, and the patient's history of chronic hepatitis C, hypothyroidism, and alcoholism does not suggest a high risk for this diagnosis. Additionally, the imaging findings do not suggest a squamous cell carcinoma, as it would typically appear as a heterogeneous mass with irregular margins and bone erosion, which is not consistent with the described homogeneous mass extending from the nasopharynx into the left sphenoid sinus.

B. Lymphoma is also an unlikely diagnosis, as the patient's symptoms and imaging findings do not suggest a lymphoproliferative disorder. The patient's age and medical history do not suggest a high risk for lymphoma, and the described mass does not have the typical features of a lymphoma, such as a heterogeneous mass with irregular margins, necrosis, or calcifications.

D. Granulomatous disease is a possibility, but it is less likely than ectopic pituitary adenoma given the patient's symptoms and imaging findings. Granulomatous diseases, such as sarcoidosis or tuberculosis, can present with nasal congestion and epistaxis, but the imaging findings typically show a heterogeneous mass with irregular margins and bone erosion, which is not consistent with the described homogeneous mass extending from the nasopharynx into the left sphenoid sinus.

**Answer**:C. Primary middle ear meningioma

The patient's symptoms of a 1-year history of left ear fullness, diminished left-sided hearing that temporarily improves with autoinsufflation, and rare facial twitching, along with the physical examination findings of a retrotympanic, nonpulsatile, tan-gray mass anterior to the malleus handle, and the results of the audiogram and imaging studies, are consistent with a diagnosis of a primary middle ear meningioma.

A meningioma is a type of benign tumor that arises from the meninges, the protective coverings of the brain and spinal cord. Primary middle ear meningiomas are rare, but they can occur in the temporal bone and extend into the middle ear cavity.

The patient's symptoms of ear fullness and hearing loss are consistent with a middle ear tumor that is affecting the conduction of sound waves through the ear. The presence of a mass in the retrotympanic region and the involvement of the geniculate ganglion suggest that the tumor is likely originating from the middle ear. The patient's rare facial twitching may be due to the tumor's effect on the facial nerve, which is in close proximity to the middle ear.

The imaging studies, including CT and MRI, support the diagnosis of a primary middle ear meningioma. The tumor's location and extension into the eustachian tube and supratubal recess are consistent with a meningioma. The enhancement of the tumor on postgadolinium MRI suggests that it is likely a meningioma.

The other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and findings.

A. Facial nerve venous malformation: This is an abnormality of the venous blood vessels in the facial nerve, which can cause symptoms such as facial weakness or paralysis, but it is not typically associated with ear fullness or hearing loss.

**Answer**: B. Hairy polyp

The correct answer is B. Hairy polyp because it best fits the patient's symptoms and the physical examination findings described in the case.

A hairy polyp is a type of benign growth that can occur in the nasal passages and is typically pedunculated, meaning it is attached to the surrounding tissue by a stalk-like structure. This fits with the patient's physical examination findings of a firm, pedunculated polypoid mass in the anterior nasal cavity.

The patient's symptoms of nasal obstruction and difficulty breathing, especially with feeding, are also consistent with a hairy polyp obstructing the nasal passage. Additionally, the absence of clear drainage from the mass and the negative Furstenberg sign (which suggests that the mass is not causing a communication between the nasal cavity and the cranial cavity) support the diagnosis of a hairy polyp.

The other answer choices do not fit the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings as well.

A. Dermoid cyst (mature teratoma) is a type of benign growth that can occur in the nasal passages, but it is typically not pedunculated and does not have a hairy appearance.

C. Glioma is a type of malignant tumor that can occur in the nasal passages, but it is not typically pedunculated and would be unlikely to cause nasal obstruction and difficulty breathing in a neonate.

D. Encephalocele is a type of congenital malformation in which the brain or meninges protrude through a defect in the skull, but it is not typically associated with a pedunculated mass in the nasal cavity.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is B. Hairy polyp.

**Answer**: C. Xeroderma pigmentosum

Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to repair DNA damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun. This leads to a high risk of developing skin cancer, particularly in sun-exposed areas.

The patient in the case presentation has a history of developing multiple tumoral lesions on sun-exposed skin, starting from a young age. The lesions have been rapidly progressing, becoming ulcerative and bleeding, and have caused severe facial disfigurement. The patient's parents are first cousins, which suggests a possible genetic component to the condition.

The clinical findings, including the diffuse warty lesions and numerous tumors, are consistent with XP. The punch biopsy results showed infiltrating basal cell carcinoma, which is a common type of skin cancer seen in XP patients.

The other answer choices do not fit the patient's symptoms and clinical findings:

A. Trichothiodystrophy is a rare genetic disorder that affects the growth and development of hair, skin, and nails. It is not associated with an increased risk of skin cancer.

B. Cockayne syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the growth and development of the body, including the skin, nervous system, and eyes. It is not associated with an increased risk of skin cancer.

D. Actinic keratosis is a type of skin lesion that occurs in sun-exposed areas and can sometimes develop into squamous cell carcinoma. However, it is not typically seen in young children like the patient in the case presentation, and it does not cause the severe facial disfigurement and rapid progression of tumors that the patient has experienced.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and clinical findings, the most likely diagnosis is Xeroderma pigmentosum.

**Answer**:C. The VEGF-D level is supportive of a diagnosis of lymphangioleiomyomatosis

<human>: Hi, I'm trying to understand why choice C is the correct answer. Can you explain why?

<bot>: Sure! Let me explain. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a rare lung disease that primarily affects women of childbearing age. It is characterized by the growth of smooth muscle-like cells in the lungs, which can cause cysts, nodules, and lung collapse. One of the key diagnostic markers for LAM is an elevated level of serum vascular endothelial growth factor D (VEGF-D). In the case presented, the patient's VEGF-D level was elevated at 1300 pg/mL, which is supportive of a diagnosis of LAM.

In contrast, choice A states that the VEGF-D level is nonspecific and the patient should undergo further evaluation with a lung biopsy. While it is true that a lung biopsy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis, the elevated VEGF-D level is a strong indicator of LAM and should not be dismissed as nonspecific.

Choice B suggests that the VEGF-D level is supportive of a diagnosis of pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis. However, Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disorder that affects the lung and other organs, and is characterized by the accumulation of Langerhans cells, which are a type of immune cell. While VEGF-D levels may be elevated in some cases of Langerhans cell histiocytosis, it is not a specific diagnostic marker for the disease.

Choice D suggests that the VEGF-D level indicates that the patient should undergo folliculin gene test for Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome. Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the lung and other organs, and is characterized by the development of lung cysts, pneumothorax, and other respiratory symptoms

The correct answer is C. Order serologic testing for parvovirus.

Parvovirus B19 is a common cause of arthritis and rash in adults, and it can be transmitted through contact with an infected person's respiratory secretions or blood. The patient's symptoms of joint pain and swelling, as well as the presence of a malar rash, are consistent with parvovirus infection. Additionally, the fact that the patient's grandchildren had a similar illness with a rash and fever suggests that there may be a viral component to the patient's symptoms. Testing for parvovirus would help to confirm this diagnosis.

The other answer choices are not as relevant to the patient's symptoms and medical history:

A. Check for anti–double-stranded DNA and anti-Smith antibodies: These tests are typically used to diagnose lupus, which is an autoimmune disorder that can cause arthritis and rash. While the patient does have a positive ANA result, which is often seen in lupus, the presence of a malar rash and the absence of other symptoms consistent with lupus make it less likely that this is the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

B. Schedule bilateral hand radiographs: While hand radiographs may be useful in evaluating joint pain and swelling, they are not likely to reveal anything specific to parvovirus infection.

D. Order testing for anticyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibody: CCP antibodies are commonly seen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, but they are not typically associated with parvovirus infection.

Therefore, the best answer is C. Order serologic testing for parvovirus.

**Answer**:A. Test results indicate presence of IgG4-related disease.

The correct answer is A because the patient's laboratory results, specifically the elevated IgG4 levels, are consistent with IgG4-related disease. IgG4 is a type of immunoglobulin that is produced in response to certain infections and autoimmune disorders. Elevated levels of IgG4 can indicate the presence of an IgG4-related disease, such as IgG4-related pancreatitis, which is a known complication of pancreatic cancer. The patient's symptoms of unintentional weight loss, increasing fasting blood glucose values, and diffuse enlargement of the pancreas with peripheral hypoenhancement on the CT scan, are also consistent with pancreatic cancer. Additionally, the patient's history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia increases the likelihood of pancreatic cancer.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

B. Test results indicate locally invasive pancreatic lymphoma: While the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with pancreatic cancer, there is no evidence to suggest that the cancer is locally invasive or that it has spread to the lymph nodes.

C. Test results indicate viral hepatitis: The patient's laboratory results do not indicate the presence of viral hepatitis. Elevated IgG4 levels are not typically seen in viral hepatitis.

D. Test results indicate pancreatic cancer but the patient is a carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 nonsecretor: While the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with pancreatic cancer, the patient's status as a CA 19-9 nonsecretor does not rule out the possibility of pancreatic cancer. CA 19-9 is a tumor marker that is often elevated in pancreatic cancer, but some patients may not secrete this marker, even if they have pancreatic cancer. Therefore, a negative CA 19-9 test result does not necessarily rule out pancreatic cancer.

**Answer**:B. Mucormycosis

The patient's symptoms and test results indicate that he has mucormycosis, a fungal infection caused by the Mucorales family of fungi. The patient's history of refractory leukemia, recent transformation to AML, and long hospital stay increase his risk of developing mucormycosis. The patient's symptoms, such as rapidly growing and severely painful oral lesions on the left hard palate, are consistent with mucormycosis. The patient's lab results, such as pancytopenia and recurrent neutropenic fevers, also support this diagnosis.

The patient's poor oral hygiene and the presence of a large swelling with a 5x3 cm indurated area of ulceration, central necrosis, and desquamation on the left hard palate are also consistent with mucormycosis. The fact that the patient was not receiving active cancer treatment and was treated palliatively with dexamethasone solution and nystatin rinse suggests that the patient's condition was not responding to conventional cancer treatment and that mucormycosis was a possible diagnosis.

The maxillofacial CT scan completed the etiological investigation and supported the diagnosis of mucormycosis. The patient's history of refractory leukemia and recent transformation to AML, along with the patient's symptoms and test results, make mucormycosis the most likely diagnosis.

Squamous cell carcinoma (choice A) is a type of cancer that can occur in the oral cavity, but it is not consistent with the patient's history of refractory leukemia and recent transformation to AML. Aspergillosis (choice C) is a type of fungal infection that can occur in immunocompromised patients, but it is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and test results.

**Answer**: C. Clear cell papulosis

Clear cell papulosis is a rare benign condition characterized by the presence of multiple small, hypopigmented macules on the skin. The lesions are typically asymptomatic and may be present at birth or develop later in life. The exact cause of clear cell papulosis is not known, but it is believed to be related to a genetic mutation that affects the development of melanocytes, the cells responsible for skin pigmentation.

In the case described in the question, the patient presented with multiple, scattered white macules on the lower abdomen and pubic area that were present at birth and had gradually increased in size and number. The lesions were well-demarcated and had a characteristic hypopigmented appearance. The patient had no history of any systemic disorder and no family history of similar lesions.

The histopathological examination of a punch biopsy specimen revealed mild hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and scattered clear cells in the epidermis. The clear cells were larger than the neighboring keratinocytes and contained abundant pale cytoplasm. These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of clear cell papulosis.

In contrast, tinea versicolor (choice A) is a common fungal infection that causes hypopigmented macules on the skin. However, tinea versicolor typically appears as scaly patches or plaques, rather than the scattered, well-demarcated macules seen in clear cell papulosis. Additionally, tinea versicolor is usually accompanied by symptoms such as itching, redness, and skin thickening, which were not reported in the case.

Vitiligo (choice B) is an autoimmune disorder that causes depigmentation of the skin due to the destruction of melanocytes. Vitiligo typically presents with larger, more irregularly shaped depigmented patches than those seen in clear cell papulosis. Additionally, vitiligo is often associated with a positive family history and a personal history of autoimmune disorders, which were not reported in the case.

**Answer**: B. Lymphomatoid granulomatosis

Lymphomatoid granulomatosis (LG) is a rare and aggressive form of cancer that affects the immune system, specifically T cells and natural killer cells. It is characterized by the formation of granulomas, which are clusters of immune cells that attempt to contain the cancer cells.

The patient's symptoms and test results are consistent with LG. The necrotic plaque on the nose and the scattered nodules on the extremities are both common symptoms of LG. The patient's history of multifocal pneumonia and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection of the nose also support this diagnosis, as LG can cause opportunistic infections. The patient's age and the rapid progression of the disease also fit with LG, as it typically affects young adults and can progress quickly.

The shave biopsy specimen of the necrotic papule on the patient's left cheek, which showed a dense infiltrate of atypical lymphocytes and immunoblasts, is also consistent with LG. The presence of central necrosis in the papule and the areas of poxlike scarring on the extremities are also typical of LG.

In contrast, extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (choice A), is a type of lymphoma that affects the nasal passages and is less aggressive than LG. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener granulomatosis) (choice C) is a systemic vasculitis that can cause granulomas, but it typically affects the lungs and kidneys, and the patient's symptoms and test results do not fit with this diagnosis.

**Answer**: B. Sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis

The patient's symptoms of progressively worsening postprandial nausea or vomiting, epigastric abdominal pain, anorexia, and weight loss, as well as the abdominal computed tomography scan showing markedly dilated stomach and duodenum with decompressed, thickened distal small bowel without a clear transition point, are consistent with a diagnosis of sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis (SEP). SEP is a rare condition characterized by the encasement of the small intestine by a fibrotic membrane, leading to bowel obstruction.

The patient's history of prostate cancer treated with robotic prostatectomy 2 years ago increases the likelihood of SEP, as it is a known complication of radiation therapy to the pelvic area. The patient's positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold test result for tuberculosis exposure also supports this diagnosis, as SEP has been associated with tuberculosis infection.

Abdominal tuberculosis: While tuberculosis exposure is a risk factor for SEP, abdominal tuberculosis is a different condition that typically presents with fever, night sweats, and abdominal pain, rather than the patient's symptoms of postprandial nausea or vomiting and epigastric abdominal pain.

C. Adhesive small bowel obstruction: The patient had a history of adhesive small bowel obstruction, but the current presentation and imaging findings are not consistent with this diagnosis. Adhesive small bowel obstruction typically presents with acute onset of abdominal pain, distension, and vomiting, and the imaging findings would show a clear transition point in the small bowel.

D. Peritoneal carcinomatosis: This diagnosis is unlikely given the patient's history and imaging findings. Peritoneal carcinomatosis typically presents with abdominal pain, distension, and ascites, and the

**Answer**: D. Infected aortic graft with aortoduodenal fistula

The patient's symptoms of weight loss, anorexia, and back pain, along with the physical examination findings of poor dental hygiene and lower extremity edema suggestive of postthrombotic syndrome, are consistent with an infected aortic graft. The patient's history of a recent tooth extraction and the elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels also support this diagnosis.

The patient's surgical history, including a previous bilateral staged carotid endarterectomy and an open repair of a juxtarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm with a knitted Dacron tube graft, increases the likelihood of an infected aortic graft. The ligation of the left renal vein adjacent to the inferior vena cava during the previous surgery may have contributed to the development of the fistula.

The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure 1A and B) shows a fluid collection adjacent to the aortic graft, which is consistent with an aortoduodenal fistula. The fistula likely developed as a result of the infection of the aortic graft.

In summary, the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, medical history, and CT scan results all support the diagnosis of an infected aortic graft with aortoduodenal fistula.

As for the other answer choices:

A. Carcinoma in the body of the pancreas: While pancreatic cancer can cause weight loss and abdominal pain, the patient's history of a recent tooth extraction and the elevated ESR and CRP levels do not support this diagnosis. Additionally, the CT scan does not show any evidence of a pancreatic mass.

B. Advanced carcinoma of the duodenum: Duodenal cancer can cause symptoms similar to those described in the patient's history, but the patient's surgical history and the CT scan results do not support this diagnosis. The CT

**Answer**:C. Check parathyroid hormone, vitamin D, and calcium levels

The patient's symptoms and clinical findings, such as blurred vision, blocked areas of vision, and elevated, hypopigmented, yellow lesions with retinal pigment epithelium changes, suggest a possible diagnosis of sclerochoroidal calcifications. This is supported by the B-scan ultrasonography findings of hyperechoic, plaquelike, solid lesions with posterior acoustic shadowing. Sclerochoroidal calcifications are typically associated with hyperparathyroidism, which leads to an increase in calcium levels in the blood. Therefore, checking the patient's parathyroid hormone, vitamin D, and calcium levels is the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic workup.

Option A, performing transvitreous biopsy, may be considered to confirm the diagnosis, but it is not the most appropriate next step. Biopsy carries risks, including infection, bleeding, and retinal damage. Moreover, the clinical presentation and imaging findings are already suggestive of sclerochoroidal calcifications, making biopsy unnecessary.

Option B, beginning oral corticosteroid therapy, is not appropriate at this stage. Corticosteroids may be used to treat inflammatory conditions, but they are not effective in treating sclerochoroidal calcifications, which are a metabolic disorder.

Option D, treating with plaque brachytherapy, is also not appropriate. Plaque brachytherapy is used to treat ocular tumors, such as uveal melanoma, but it is not indicated for sclerochoroidal calcifications.

In summary, checking the patient's parathyroid hormone, vitamin D, and calcium levels is the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic workup of this patient with suspected sclerochoroidal calcifications. This will help to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.

**Answer**:C. Order mitochondrial genetic testing.
Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of progressive painless visual loss, photophobia, and color vision impairment in both eyes, along with the bilateral cecocentral scotomata and normal fundus examination, are consistent with Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON). LHON is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA, which affects the optic nerve and leads to vision loss. The patient's history of hypothyroidism and meningioma of the cervical spine increases the likelihood of LHON.

The patient's normal full-field electroretinography (ERG) results and reduced multifocal electroretinography (mfERG) wave amplitudes nasal to the fovea in each eye, suggest a selective loss of retinal ganglion cells, which is consistent with LHON.

Therefore, the next step would be to order mitochondrial genetic testing to confirm the diagnosis of LHON. This testing can identify the specific genetic mutations responsible for the disease, which in this case is likely to be a homoplasmic variant in ND6 (m.14484T>C).

The other options are not the most appropriate next steps for the following reasons:

A. Analyze the thickness of retinal layers by SD-OCT segmentation: While SD-OCT can be useful in evaluating retinal thickness and detecting structural changes, it is not the most appropriate test to diagnose LHON. The patient's symptoms and examination findings are more consistent with a functional defect in the retinal ganglion cells, which would not be detected by SD-OCT.

B. Ask about antihypertensives taken in the evening, sleep apnea, and cardiovascular risk factors: These questions are relevant for evaluating potential causes of vision loss, but they are not specific to LHON. The patient's history of hypothyroidism and meningioma of the cervical spine already increases the likelihood of LHON, and the symptoms and examination findings support this diagn

**Answer**:B. Order a hormone profile (thyrotropin, adrenocorticotrophic hormone, growth hormone, and testosterone) and consult endocrinology

The correct answer is B because the patient's symptoms of hypochondroplasia, alopecia, and short stature suggest a potential endocrine disorder. The patient's history of type 1 diabetes and frequent urinary tract infections also support this possibility. Ordering a hormone profile and consulting endocrinology can help identify any hormonal imbalances or deficiencies that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms.

A is incorrect because while MRI of the brain may be useful in evaluating the patient's vision loss, it is not directly related to the patient's symptoms of short stature, hypochondroplasia, and alopecia.

C is incorrect because while a peripheral blood smear examination may be useful in evaluating the patient's anemia, it is not directly related to the patient's symptoms of short stature, hypochondroplasia, and alopecia.

D is incorrect because while targeted genetic testing may be useful in identifying genetic causes of the patient's symptoms, it is not the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation. A hormone profile and endocrinology consultation are more likely to provide useful information in this case.

**Answer**:D. Review medications

The correct answer is D. Review medications. The patient's symptoms of night blindness, ring scotoma, and nonrecordable electroretinogram suggest a retinal degeneration, which could be related to a side effect of certain medications. The patient's history of hypertension, diabetes, and mixed connective tissue disease increases the likelihood of medication-related retinal toxicity. Therefore, reviewing the patient's medications is an appropriate next step to identify potential culprits and prevent further damage.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Perform genetic testing: While genetic testing may be appropriate in certain cases of retinal degeneration, it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's symptoms and clinical findings suggest a more immediate cause, and genetic testing would not provide a clear diagnosis or guide treatment.

B. Order antiretinal antibodies: Antiretinal antibodies are not typically associated with retinal degeneration. While they may be present in certain autoimmune conditions, they are not the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms.

C. Perform systemic evaluation for malignancy: While it is important to consider the possibility of a systemic condition causing the patient's symptoms, there is no evidence to suggest a malignancy is present. The patient's history of hypertension, diabetes, and mixed connective tissue disease suggests a more likely cause of retinal degeneration.

Therefore, D. Review medications is the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation.

**Answer**:C. Another MRI scan of the orbit

The patient in this case has a history of diplopia, optic disc edema, and amaurosis, which suggests a possible inflammatory or infectious cause. The initial MRI scan did not reveal any apparent abnormalities, but the patient's symptoms have persisted over time. Therefore, it is appropriate to order another MRI scan of the orbit to further evaluate the patient's condition.

Option A, risk factor modification, is not directly related to the patient's current symptoms and is not the most appropriate next step in management.

Option B, perform a lumbar puncture, may be considered in the workup of certain neurological conditions, but it is not directly relevant to the patient's current symptoms and is not the most appropriate next step.

Option D, initiate corticosteroids, may be considered in the management of certain inflammatory conditions, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case without further diagnostic information.

Therefore, the correct answer is C, another MRI scan of the orbit, to further evaluate the patient's condition and identify any potential causes of his symptoms.

**Answer**:B. Order a complete blood cell count

Explanation:

A. Order tests for syphilis, tuberculosis, and sarcoidosis; if results are negative, start treatment with oral corticosteroids:
This choice is incorrect because, although it is appropriate to consider infectious and inflammatory causes of bilateral subretinal fluid, the patient's history and examination findings do not suggest a typical presentation of these conditions. The patient's age and lack of other symptoms make it less likely that the condition is caused by syphilis, tuberculosis, or sarcoidosis. Additionally, starting treatment with oral corticosteroids without further investigation may not address the underlying cause of the condition.

C. Order magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits:
This choice is incorrect because, although MRI imaging may be useful in evaluating the central nervous system, it is not the most appropriate test to diagnose the cause of bilateral subretinal fluid. MRI may not show the detailed structure of the retina and may not be able to diagnose retinal conditions such as central serous chorioretinopathy.

D. Observe the patient; offer photodynamic therapy if the subretinal fluid persists for 3 months:
This choice is incorrect because, although photodynamic therapy may be a treatment option for central serous chorioretinopathy, it is not the most appropriate step at this point in the patient's care. The patient has already experienced a significant decline in visual acuity, and close observation alone may not address the underlying cause of the condition.

B. Order a complete blood cell count:
This choice is correct because a complete blood cell count can help identify potential causes of bilateral subretinal fluid, such as a systemic inflammatory or hematological disorder. The patient's history of painless blurry vision and the bilateral nature of the subretinal fluid suggest a possible systemic cause, and a complete blood cell count can help evaluate for potential causes such as leukemia, lymphoma, or other hematological disorders. Additionally, a complete blood cell count can help assess the patient's overall health status and inform further management decisions.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

**Answer**: B. Follicular lymphoma

The patient's presentation of a rapidly enlarging scalp lesion, itchiness, weight loss, and history of vague abdominal pain, as well as the physical examination findings of cervical lymphadenopathy, are all consistent with a diagnosis of follicular lymphoma. Follicular lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that typically presents with skin involvement, and it is not uncommon for patients to have a history of vague symptoms such as abdominal pain.

The biopsy specimen shown in Figure 1B supports the diagnosis of follicular lymphoma, as it shows a nodular infiltrate of small, mature-appearing lymphocytes with a "salt and pepper" appearance, which is characteristic of follicular lymphoma. Additionally, the presence of cervical lymphadenopathy and the patient's history of weight loss and abdominal pain also support the diagnosis.

Mycosis fungoides, option A, is a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that typically presents with skin lesions that have a characteristic "plaque-like" appearance. While the patient's skin lesion does have a plaque-like appearance, the presence of cervical lymphadenopathy and the patient's history of abdominal pain are not typical of mycosis fungoides.

Lichen planus, option C, is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that can cause skin lesions and itching. However, lichen planus typically does not cause cervical lymphadenopathy or weight loss, and the patient's history of abdominal pain is not consistent with this diagnosis.

Marginal zone lymphoma, option D, is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that typically presents with lymphadenopathy and bone marrow involvement. While the patient's cervical lymphadenopathy is consistent with this diagnosis, the patient's history of weight loss and abdominal pain are not typical

**Answer**:C. Pursue the culprit coronary artery as yet not identified

Explanation:
The patient presented with inferior ST-segment elevation, which suggests a possible occlusion of the right coronary artery. However, the angiography showed that the left anterior descending artery was also affected. Therefore, it is crucial to identify the culprit coronary artery to determine the appropriate course of action. Choice C, pursuing the culprit coronary artery, is the correct answer as it allows the medical team to identify the artery responsible for the patient's symptoms and take appropriate action.

Choice A, performing coronary intervention with stenting of the left anterior descending artery, may not be the best course of action as it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Choice B, determining the severity of the left anterior descending artery plaque by measuring fractional flow reserve, may be useful in evaluating the severity of the blockage, but it does not identify the culprit artery. Choice D, ordering urgent computed tomography angiography, may provide additional information, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this scenario.

**Answer**:D. Perform an endoscopic ultrasound of the pancreas with fine-needle aspiration

The correct answer is D. Perform an endoscopic ultrasound of the pancreas with fine-needle aspiration.

The patient's elevated α-fetoprotein (AFP) level and liver masses suggest a possible diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the presence of a pancreatic tail mass, as revealed by the triple-phase CT scan, raises the possibility of a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PNET).

Option A, beginning FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy, is not the best next step. While FOLFIRINOX is a common chemotherapy regimen for HCC, it is not the most appropriate treatment for PNETs.

Option B, beginning sorafenib, is also not the best next step. Sorafenib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is used to treat HCC, but it is not the most effective treatment for PNETs.

Option C, performing a fludeoxyglucose F 18 (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scan, may be useful in evaluating the patient's liver masses, but it would not provide definitive diagnostic information about the pancreatic tail mass.

Option D, performing an endoscopic ultrasound of the pancreas with fine-needle aspiration, is the best next step. This procedure would allow for a tissue diagnosis of the pancreatic tail mass, which would help to determine whether it is a PNET or another type of pancreatic tumor. Additionally, endoscopic ultrasound can provide information about the size, location, and vascularity of the tumor, which would be useful in determining the best course of treatment.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Perform an endoscopic ultrasound of the pancreas with fine-needle aspiration.

**Answer**: C. Benign thyroid rest

The patient's symptoms of recent onset of wheezing and dyspnea, along with the physical examination findings of biphasic stridor and normal vocal cord mobility, suggest an intratracheal mass. The patient's history of a recent onset of symptoms and the absence of any suspicious adenopathy on imaging studies also support this diagnosis.

The imaging findings, including the CT and MRI scans, show a mass protruding into the trachea in the posterolateral aspect of the right side of the tracheal region that appears to be contiguous with the thyroid gland. The mass shows enhancement on administration of contrast medium, which suggests that it is likely a benign thyroid rest.

The patient's serum calcitonin level of 23 pg/mL is normal, which makes medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) less likely. The presence of an 8-mm nodule in the left thyroid lobe that shows enhancement on administration of contrast medium and the absence of any other suspicious adenopathy also support the diagnosis of a benign thyroid rest.

Amyloidosis is a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's symptoms and imaging findings. Mucoid pseudotumor is also a possibility, but it is rare and typically presents with different symptoms and imaging findings. Aggressive invasive thyroid cancer is unlikely given the patient's age and the absence of any other suspicious adenopathy.

**Answer**:C. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis

The correct answer is C. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis because it is a condition that can cause destructive sinonasal processes leading to sudden blindness, as described in the case. The patient's symptoms of nasal congestion, headaches, and vision loss, along with the physical examination findings of afferent pupillary defect and cranial sixth-nerve palsy, are consistent with this diagnosis. The laboratory results showing an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level also support this diagnosis.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Lymphoma: Although lymphoma can affect the sinuses, it is not typically associated with sudden blindness or the destructive sinonasal process described in the case. The patient's age and symptoms do not fit the typical demographics for lymphoma.

B. Acute invasive fungal sinusitis: This condition typically presents with sudden onset of severe headache, fever, and facial swelling, which were not mentioned in the case. The patient's symptoms of nasal congestion and headaches over several months suggest a chronic rather than acute process.

D. Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma: This is a rare type of cancer that can affect the sinuses, but it typically presents with chronic nasal symptoms and does not typically cause sudden blindness. The patient's age and symptoms do not fit the typical demographics for this diagnosis.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is C. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis.

**Answer**:A. Extranodal T-cell lymphoma

The patient's symptoms and imaging results are consistent with Extranodal T-cell lymphoma, a type of cancer that affects the immune system. The patient's nasal pain and swelling, progressive over 6 weeks, and the extension of the swelling to the upper lip, are all consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's difficulty swallowing, headache, and nasal drainage also align with this diagnosis.

The imaging results also support this diagnosis. The marked soft tissue swelling and fullness with abnormal enhancement along the nasal cavity, including bilateral nasal ala, with areas of necrosis and emphysema, are consistent with the tumor infiltrating the nasal tissue. The absence of significant bony erosion or associated calcification on bone windows also supports this diagnosis.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegner granulomatosis) and relapsing polychondritis, choice B, is an autoimmune disorder that affects the blood vessels and can cause nasal symptoms, but it is less likely given the patient's age and the absence of other symptoms. Squamous cell carcinoma, choice C, is a type of skin cancer that can affect the nasal area, but it is less likely given the patient's age and the absence of other symptoms. Necrotizing fasciitis, choice D, is a bacterial infection that can cause skin and soft tissue destruction, but it is less likely given the patient's age and the absence of other symptoms.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and imaging results, Extranodal T-cell lymphoma is the most likely diagnosis.

**Answer**: D. Myositis ossificans

Myositis ossificans is a condition where there is abnormal growth of bone in muscle tissue. It is a type of benign tumor that can occur in various parts of the body, including the neck. The patient's symptoms of a progressively enlarging mass in the left posterior triangle of the neck, along with the imaging findings of a well-circumscribed ossified lesion, are consistent with myositis ossificans.

The patient's history of a motor vehicle accident 3 years prior to presentation suggests a possible traumatic etiology for the myositis ossificans. Trauma to the muscle tissue can cause inflammation and damage to the muscle fibers, leading to the formation of bone in the affected area.

The imaging findings also support the diagnosis of myositis ossificans. The dense acoustic shadowing on ultrasound and the well-circumscribed ossified mass on CT imaging are consistent with the characteristic "rugger jersey" or "spiculated" appearance of myositis ossificans. Additionally, the lack of aggressive-appearing periosteal reaction suggests that the lesion is not malignant, which is consistent with the benign nature of myositis ossificans.

In contrast, osteochondroma (choice A) is a benign bony outgrowth that typically occurs on the surface of bones, rather than within muscle tissue. Osteoid osteoma (choice B) is a benign tumor that consists of bone and cartilage and is typically found in the long bones of the extremities. Osteosarcoma (choice C) is a malignant tumor that arises from bone tissue and can occur in various parts of the body, but it is not typically associated with a history of trauma.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, imaging findings, and history, the most likely diagnosis is myositis ossificans.

**Answer**: D. Initiate negative-pressure isolation

The correct answer is D. Initiate negative-pressure isolation, as the patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a possible diagnosis of viral hepatitis, which requires isolation precautions to prevent transmission to others.

B. Obtain an HIV immunoassay is incorrect because HIV is not typically associated with viral hepatitis, and an HIV test would not be necessary at this point in the patient's evaluation.

C. Perform liver biopsy is incorrect because a liver biopsy is an invasive procedure that carries risks and is not necessary for the initial evaluation and management of viral hepatitis. Additionally, a liver biopsy would not provide a definitive diagnosis of viral hepatitis, as it would require further laboratory testing.

**Answer**:D. The patient has warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia.

The correct answer is D, "The patient has warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia," because the patient's laboratory results indicate a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) with IgG and C3d, which suggests the presence of warm autoantibodies. Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (WAIHA) is a type of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) caused by the production of autoantibodies that react with red blood cells at body temperature. The presence of warm autoantibodies is confirmed by the positive DAT result.

Option A, "The patient has cold agglutinin disease," is incorrect because cold agglutinin disease is a type of autoimmune hemolytic anemia caused by the production of cold autoantibodies that react with red blood cells at low temperatures. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not suggest cold agglutinin disease.

Option B, "The patient has pure red cell aplasia," is incorrect because pure red cell aplasia is a condition characterized by the absence of red blood cell production in the bone marrow, which is not suggested by the patient's laboratory results.

Option C, "The patient has undergone Richter transformation," is incorrect because Richter transformation is a complication of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) characterized by the transformation of CLL cells into a more aggressive form of lymphoma.

**Answer**:B. Continue medical therapy alone, with a β-blocker and antiplatelet therapy

The patient presented with chest pain and was diagnosed with non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient already had a history of asthma and underwent an elective cesarean delivery 11 days prior. The patient's troponin I level was elevated, and an electrocardiogram showed diffuse ST-segment depressions. The patient was started on aspirin and ticagrelor, heparin infusion, and metoprolol tartrate for treatment of NSTEMI.

Administering thrombolytic therapy (choice A) may not be appropriate for this patient, as thrombolytic therapy is typically used for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) rather than NSTEMI. Additionally, the patient's history of asthma may increase the risk of bleeding complications associated with thrombolytic therapy.

Performing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) (choice C) may not be necessary at this time, as the patient's coronary angiography showed no significant coronary artery stenosis. PCI may be considered in the future if the patient's condition warrants it.

Referring for coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery (choice D) may not be necessary at this time, as the patient's coronary angiography showed no significant coronary artery stenosis. CABG surgery may be considered in the future if the patient's condition warrants it.

Therefore, continuing medical therapy alone, with a β-blocker and antiplatelet therapy (choice B) is the most appropriate course of action for this patient. This treatment plan will help manage the patient's NSTEMI and reduce the risk of future cardiovascular events.

**Answer**:B. The patient has acute kidney injury most likely related to sepsis.

The correct answer is B because the patient's acute kidney injury (AKI) is most likely caused by sepsis, which is a systemic inflammatory response to an infection. The patient's history of cancer, recent surgery, and mechanical ventilation also increase the risk of AKI. The patient's urine output and laboratory values, particularly the elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN), support the diagnosis of AKI.

Option A is incorrect because while the change in serum creatinine is within the coefficient of variation, it does not rule out the possibility of AKI. AKI can occur even with small changes in serum creatinine, especially in the early stages.

Option C is incorrect because prerenal azotemia is a condition where the kidneys are not able to concentrate urine due to a lack of adequate blood flow. While the patient's urine output is low, it is not consistent with prerenal azotemia.

Option D is incorrect because there are sufficient data to conclude that a decrease in glomerular filtration rate has occurred, as evidenced by the elevated serum creatinine and BUN. The patient's history and clinical presentation also support the diagnosis of AKI.

**Answer**:B. Inverse lichen planus

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with inverse lichen planus (ILP), a variant of lichen planus that affects the flexural areas of the body, such as the axillae, inguinal region, and inframammary folds. ILP is characterized by the presence of well-defined, violaceous, annular patches without scale or erosion, which is consistent with the patient's skin lesions. The patient's history of severe pruritus, which is a common symptom of ILP, also supports this diagnosis.

The other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's condition:

A. Familial benign pemphigus (Hailey-Hailey disease): This is a rare genetic disorder characterized by blistering and erosions on the skin, particularly in the axillae and groin area. However, the patient's history of discrete, dark red, circular lesions and the absence of blisters or erosions do not support this diagnosis.

C. Fixed drug eruption: This is a type of adverse drug reaction that occurs when a patient develops a persistent, circular erythematous patch at the site of a previous drug eruption. However, the patient's history of no recent medication changes and the absence of any other skin lesions do not support this diagnosis.

D. Erythrasma: This is a mild, superficial bacterial infection that often affects the axillae and groin area. However, the patient's history of severe pruritus and the presence of well-defined, violaceous patches do not support this diagnosis.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is inverse lichen planus.

**Answer**: C. Oral hairy leukoplakia

The patient's symptoms and clinical presentation, as well as the histopathological results of the biopsy, are consistent with a diagnosis of oral hairy leukoplakia.

Oral hairy leukoplakia is a rare condition characterized by the growth of hair-like projections on the tongue or other oral mucous membranes. It is often associated with underlying conditions such as oral lichen planus, oral thrush, or chronic graft-versus-host disease. In this case, the patient has a history of oral lichen planus, which increases the likelihood of a diagnosis of oral hairy leukoplakia.

The histopathological features of oral hairy leukoplakia, as seen in the biopsy specimens, are also consistent with this diagnosis. The presence of hyperkeratotic, acanthotic stratified squamous epithelium with cells having lightly stained cytoplasm (balloon cells) throughout the stratum spinosum and superficial layer, as well as several epithelial nuclei with peripheral chromatin margination (chromatin beading), are all characteristic features of oral hairy leukoplakia.

In contrast, oral frictional keratosis is a condition that occurs due to chronic friction or irritation of the oral mucosa, typically caused by ill-fitting dentures, rough teeth, or other oral appliances. While it may present with a similar clinical appearance, the histopathological features are distinct, showing a more prominent squamous cell layer with minimal inflammation.

Oral lichen planus, also a possible diagnosis, is an autoimmune disease that affects the oral mucosa and can cause white patches, ulcers, and pain. However, the patient's history of OLP managed with topical corticosteroids and antifungals, as well as the absence of characteristic Wickham's striae on the tongue, make it less likely.

**Answer**: A. Pigmented onychomatricoma

The patient's symptoms and the biopsy results suggest that the diagnosis is pigmented onychomatricoma. Onychomatricoma is a rare benign tumor of the nail matrix that can cause longitudinal pigmented bands on the nail plate. The pigmentation is typically dark brown or black and can extend to the proximal nail fold, as seen in this case. The tumor is usually asymptomatic and can progressively grow over time, which is consistent with the patient's history.

The histopathologic examination of the biopsy specimen shows a characteristic pattern of pigmentation, with a dark brown pigment band extending to the proximal nail fold. This is consistent with the clinical appearance of pigmented onychomatricoma.

The other choices are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and biopsy results:

B. Subungual melanoma: Although subungual melanoma can present with a pigmented band on the nail plate, it typically has a different clinical appearance, with a wider pigmented band that extends beyond the nail plate and onto the surrounding skin. Additionally, subungual melanoma is a malignant tumor that can cause symptoms such as pain, bleeding, or ulceration, which are not present in this case.

C. Pigmented squamous cell carcinoma in situ: Pigmented squamous cell carcinoma in situ can also cause pigmented lesions on the nail plate, but it typically has a different histopathologic appearance, with a greater degree of cellular atypia and mitotic activity. Additionally, it is less common for pigmented squamous cell carcinoma in situ to extend to the proximal nail fold.

D. Pigmented onychopapilloma: Pigmented onychopapilloma is a rare benign tumor of the nail plate that can cause pigmented lesions. However, it typically has a different clinical appearance, with a smaller, more irregular pigmented area that is not longitudinal. Additionally,

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is C: Clinical follow-up for at least 3 years and indicated primary prevention.

Let's go through each answer choice and explain why it's incorrect or correct:

A: Discharge to general practitioner with no clinical recommendations

This answer choice is incorrect because the patient's symptoms, such as social withdrawal, difficulty with academic work, and vague feelings of perplexity and derealization, indicate that he may be at risk of developing a mental health disorder. Discharging him without any clinical recommendations or follow-up would not address the underlying issues and may lead to a worse outcome for the patient.

B: Pharmacotherapy with low-dose atypical antipsychotics

This answer choice is incorrect because there is no clear indication for pharmacotherapy at this point. The patient does not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of a mental health disorder, and there is no evidence of significant symptoms that would warrant medication. Additionally, low-dose atypical antipsychotics are not typically used as a first-line treatment for mild mental health problems.

D: Treatment with ω-3 fish oil dietary supplementation

This answer choice is incorrect because there is no evidence to support the use of ω-3 fish oil dietary supplementation as a treatment for mild mental health problems. While some studies suggest that ω-3 supplements may have beneficial effects on mood and cognitive function, there is no conclusive evidence to support its use in this case.

C: Clinical follow-up for at least 3 years and indicated primary prevention

This answer choice is correct because it acknowledges the patient's vulnerability to developing a mental health disorder and the importance of early intervention. Clinical follow-up for at least 3 years would allow for ongoing assessment and monitoring of the patient's symptoms, ensuring that any potential issues are addressed promptly. Additionally, primary prevention strategies, such as psychoeducation and stress management techniques, can be implemented to help the patient manage their symptoms and reduce the risk of developing a mental health disorder.

**Answer**:C. Autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay

The correct answer is C. Autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay, as it matches the clinical presentation and fundus findings described in the case.

A. Leber hereditary optic neuropathy is an incorrect choice, as it is a rare genetic disorder that affects the optic nerve, leading to progressive loss of central vision. Although the patient in the case has a peculiar fundus finding, it is not consistent with Leber hereditary optic neuropathy.

B. Friedreich ataxia is an incorrect choice, as it is the most common form of autosomal recessive ataxia, characterized by progressive gait ataxia, pyramidal signs, and loss of deep tendon reflexes. Although the patient in the case has ataxia and pyramidal signs, the fundus finding of increased visibility of retinal nerve fibers and OCT evidence of increased thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer are not typical of Friedreich ataxia.

D. Complicated hereditary spastic paraplegia is an incorrect choice, as it is a group of rare genetic disorders characterized by progressive spastic paraparesis, cognitive decline, and various neurological symptoms. Although the patient in the case has spastic ataxia, the fundus finding and OCT evidence are not consistent with complicated hereditary spastic paraplegia.

Autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay, on the other hand, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive spastic ataxia, cognitive decline, and visual loss. The distinctive fundus finding of increased visibility of retinal nerve fibers, as seen in the case, is a hallmark of this condition. The OCT evidence of increased thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer also supports this diagnosis. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

**Answer**: C. Superior lumbar hernia (Grynfeltt-Lesshaft hernia)

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a superior lumbar hernia, also known as a Grynfeltt-Lesshaft hernia. This type of hernia occurs when there is a defect in the posterior abdominal wall, typically at the level of the lumbar vertebrae. The patient's bulge in the left midback, which is accentuated with a cough impulse and less distinct when examined in the prone position, is consistent with a hernia. The absence of pain directly overlying the area and the presence of a soft bulge in the lateral left midback also support this diagnosis.

Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis (Figure, B) shows a well-circumscribed, extra-peritoneal mass that is consistent with a hernia sac. The location of the mass, at the level of the lumbar vertebrae, is also consistent with a superior lumbar hernia.

In contrast, option A, left lateral lumbar lipoma, is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. A lipoma is a benign fatty tumor that is usually asymptomatic and does not cause back pain or a bulge. Option B, posterior lateral muscular atrophy with pseudohernia, is also unlikely given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Pseudohernia is a condition where there is a bulge in the abdominal wall due to weakness or atrophy of the muscles, but there is no actual hernia. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are more consistent with a true hernia. Option D, postoperative infected seroma, is unlikely given the patient's history and physical examination findings. A seroma is a collection of fluid that can occur after surgery, but it would not cause a bulge in the abdominal wall.

Therefore, the correct answer is C, Superior lumbar hernia (Grynfeltt-Lesshaft hernia).

**Answer**: D. A pathological vertebral body fracture, in this case from metastatic thyroid cancer

The patient's symptoms of worsening neck and shoulder pain, along with the physical examination findings of cervical midline spine tenderness and tracheal deviation, suggest a possible spinal injury or pathology. The patient's history of recent treatment for musculoskeletal symptoms and lack of recent trauma suggest that the cause is likely not a recent injury.

The plain radiograph of the neck demonstrated tracheal deviation, which is a common sign of a pathological fracture. The computed tomography scan of the chest (Figure 1A) showed a destructive lesion in the vertebral body, which is consistent with a pathological fracture. The magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical and thoracic spine (Figure 1B) showed an expansile, heterogeneous mass involving the vertebral body, which is consistent with a metastatic lesion.

Given the patient's history of thyroid cancer, the most likely diagnosis is a pathological vertebral body fracture due to metastatic thyroid cancer. This is supported by the imaging findings of a destructive lesion in the vertebral body and an expansile, heterogeneous mass involving the vertebral body.

The other answer choices do not fit the patient's symptoms and imaging findings. Choice A, metastatic lung cancer, is unlikely given the patient's history of thyroid cancer and the absence of lung symptoms. Choice B, traumatic vertebral body fracture, is unlikely given the patient's lack of recent trauma and the presence of a destructive lesion in the vertebral body. Choice C, thyroid goiter with compressive symptoms, is unlikely given the patient's lack of thyroid symptoms and the presence of a pathological fracture.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. A pathological vertebral body fracture, in this case from metastatic thyroid cancer.

**Answer**:C. Obtain an aqueous fluid sample for polymerase chain reaction and treat with antiviral agents

The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of posterior uveitis, specifically a type of posterior uveitis known as retinal vasculitis. The patient's history of rapid vision loss, floaters, and blurred vision, along with the physical examination findings of anterior chamber cell and flare, keratic precipitates, vitritis, and retinal whitening, are all consistent with this diagnosis.

The correct answer, C. Obtain an aqueous fluid sample for polymerase chain reaction and treat with antiviral agents, is the appropriate next step in management. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a possible viral etiology, and obtaining an aqueous fluid sample for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can help to confirm this diagnosis. PCR is a highly sensitive and specific test that can detect viral DNA or RNA in the aqueous humor, which is the fluid that fills the anterior and posterior chambers of the eye. If the PCR test is positive, it would support the diagnosis of a viral infection, and antiviral therapy would be appropriate.

The other answer choices are not the most appropriate next steps in management for this patient.

A. Inject an antivascular endothelial growth factor agent is not the most appropriate next step, as there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has a vascular tumor or other vascular abnormality that would require this treatment.

B. Order a hypercoagulable workup and start a regimen of aspirin, 325 mg daily is not the most appropriate next step, as there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has a hypercoagulable state or that anticoagulation therapy would be beneficial.

D. Obtain a vitreous sample for culture and inject vancomycin and ceftazidime is not the most appropriate next step, as there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has a bacterial infection, and obtaining a vitreous sample for culture would not be necessary at this time.

**Answer**: C. Oral corticosteroid treatment and biopsy

The correct answer is C, Oral corticosteroid treatment and biopsy, for the following reasons:

* Oral corticosteroid treatment can help reduce inflammation and swelling in the eyelids, which can help alleviate symptoms and improve vision.
* A biopsy can help establish a definitive diagnosis of the yellow lesions and the mass in the left superolateral orbit.
* The patient's history of adult-onset asthma and waxing and waning bilateral swelling of the upper eyelids, along with the physical examination findings of yellow lesions, erythema, ptosis, and an S-shaped deformity of the left upper eyelid, suggest a possible diagnosis of orbital inflammatory disease.
* The presence of a mass in the left superolateral orbit and the enlargement and homogeneous enhancement of the left lacrimal gland and left lateral rectus muscle suggest a possible diagnosis of a lacrimal gland tumor or inflammatory pseudotumor.
* A biopsy would help to confirm or rule out these possibilities and guide further management.

As for the other choices:

* A. Oral antibiotic treatment: This would not be effective in treating the underlying inflammatory or tumoral process and would not address the patient's symptoms.
* B. Surgical debulking: This would not be appropriate at this stage, as the diagnosis has not been established and there is no clear indication for surgery.
* D. Corticosteroid-sparing immunosuppressive therapy: This would not be appropriate at this stage, as the diagnosis has not been established and there is no clear indication for immunosuppressive therapy.

Therefore, the best answer is C, Oral corticosteroid treatment and biopsy.

**Answer**:B. Further taper her corticosteroid dosage and start a cycloplegic agent to break posterior synechiae

The patient presented with symptoms of photophobia, blurred vision, and eye pain after undergoing laser eyebrow epilation. The patient's symptoms and examination findings, including anterior chamber pigment and flare, iris irregularities, and mild intraocular pressure asymmetry, suggest the possibility of a posterior synechiae.

Posterior synechiae occur when there is an adhesion between the iris and the lens, which can cause pupillary irregularity and shallow anterior chamber. In this case, the patient's irregular pupil and peripupillary transillumination defects suggest the presence of posterior synechiae.

The correct answer, B, suggests further tapering the patient's corticosteroid dosage and starting a cycloplegic agent to break the posterior synechiae. Corticosteroids can help reduce inflammation and prevent further damage to the eye, while a cycloplegic agent can help relax the ciliary muscles and break the adhesion between the iris and the lens.

In contrast, answer A, increasing the patient's topical corticosteroid dosage, may not be effective in breaking the posterior synechiae and may even worsen the patient's symptoms. Answer C, performing AC paracentesis and sending fluid for viral polymerase chain reaction analysis, may be necessary if the patient's symptoms persist or worsen, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this time. Answer D, performing urgent peripheral iridotomy given IOP asymmetry, is not indicated in this case as the patient's IOP asymmetry is mild and there is no evidence of angle closure.

**Answer**:C

Explanation:

A. Order magnetic resonance imaging of the brain with venography:
This choice is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and examination findings do not suggest a neurological issue. The patient's blurry vision, pain, and relative afferent pupillary defect are consistent with an ophthalmic problem, and MRI of the brain would not be the next step in management.

B. Perform gonioscopy:
This choice is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and examination findings do not suggest a gonioscopic issue. The patient's blurry vision, pain, and relative afferent pupillary defect are consistent with an ophthalmic problem, and gonioscopy would not be the next step in management.

C. Instill a miotic agent:
This choice is correct because the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a traumatic cyclodialysis cleft. The patient's diminished visual acuity, IOP elevation, and corneal microcystic edema are consistent with this diagnosis. Instilling a miotic agent would help to reduce the IOP and promote healing of the cleft.

D. Perform peripheral iridotomy:
This choice is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and examination findings do not suggest a peripheral iridotomy issue. The patient's blurry vision, pain, and relative afferent pupillary defect are consistent with an ophthalmic problem, and peripheral iridotomy would not be the next step in management.

**Answer**: C. Obtain a complete blood cell count

The patient's symptoms of facial plethora, dilated retinal veins, and bruising on the right shoulder, along with the abnormal findings on retinal examination, suggest the possibility of a systemic condition that may be affecting the patient's vasculature. A complete blood cell count (CBC) would be an appropriate next step in the patient's workup to help identify any potential hematological or vascular abnormalities.

A. Order a computed tomography scan of the abdomen: While a CT scan of the abdomen may be useful in evaluating the patient's abdominal symptoms, it is not the most appropriate next step in the patient's workup at this time. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a potential hematological or vascular disorder, and a CBC would be a more appropriate test to order first.

B. Perform ocular massage: Ocular massage is not a diagnostic test or treatment for the patient's symptoms. It is not an appropriate next step in the patient's workup.

D. Perform genetic testing for the VHL gene: The patient's symptoms do not suggest a genetic disorder, and genetic testing for the VHL gene would not be an appropriate next step in the patient's workup at this time.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Obtain a complete blood cell count.

The correct answer is C. Hematologic workup.

The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest the possibility of a systemic inflammatory disorder, such as birdshot chorioretinopathy, which is a rare inflammatory eye disease that can be associated with other systemic autoimmune disorders. The patient's history of ankylosing spondylitis, ulcerative colitis, and osteoporosis also suggests a possible underlying systemic inflammatory condition.

A hematologic workup would be appropriate to rule out any underlying hematologic disorders that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms, such as a blood dyscrasia or autoimmune disorder. This would include a complete blood count, blood smear, and other tests as indicated.

Option A, observation, is not appropriate at this time, as the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a possible underlying systemic disorder that needs to be investigated further.

Option B, initiation of treatment with systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppression after HLA-A29 laboratory analysis, may be appropriate in the future, but it is premature at this point. The patient's diagnosis has not been confirmed, and there are other potential causes of his symptoms that need to be ruled out before initiating treatment.

Option D, vitreous biopsy, may also be appropriate in the future, but it is not the next step in the patient's management. A vitreous biopsy would provide more information about the nature of the subretinal deposits, but it is invasive and carries risks, so it should only be performed after other diagnostic tests have been completed and the patient's diagnosis has been confirmed.

Therefore, the next step in the patient's management would be a hematologic workup to rule out any underlying hematologic disorders that may be contributing to his symptoms.

Answer: D. Nuclear protein in testis midline carcinoma

Explanation:

A. Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung:
This choice is incorrect because although squamous cell carcinoma is a type of lung cancer, the histological features described in the question do not support this diagnosis. The presence of foci of abrupt squamous differentiation, including keratinization and intercellular bridges, suggests a poorly differentiated malignant neoplasm, which is not consistent with the characteristic features of squamous cell carcinoma.

B. Carcinoid tumor:
This choice is incorrect because carcinoid tumors are typically slow-growing, well-differentiated neuroendocrine tumors that do not have the same histological features as the poorly differentiated malignant neoplasm described in the question. Additionally, the presence of extensive skeletal metastases and the absence of typical carcinoid tumor markers, such as synaptophysin and chromogranin, argue against this diagnosis.

C. Primary malignant mediastinal germ cell tumor:
This choice is incorrect because the histological features described in the question do not support a germ cell tumor. The presence of a poorly differentiated malignant neoplasm with foci of abrupt squamous differentiation and the absence of germ cell markers, such as alpha-fetoprotein and human chorionic gonadotropin, argue against this diagnosis.

D. Nuclear protein in testis midline carcinoma:
This choice is correct because the histological features described in the question, including the presence of a poorly differentiated malignant neoplasm with foci of abrupt squamous differentiation, are consistent with a diagnosis of nuclear protein in testis midline carcinoma. Additionally, the presence of extensive skeletal metastases and the negative immunohistochemical staining for S-100, melan A, placental alkaline phosphatase, CD56, thyroid transcription factor-1, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, CD45, and cytokeratin 7 support this diagnosis.

**Answer**: B. Computed tomography of the head

The patient's comatose state and recent cardiac arrest suggest that there may be a neurological component to their condition. Computed tomography (CT) of the head is the most appropriate next step to evaluate the patient's brain function and identify any potential causes of their coma. A CT scan can help identify intracranial hemorrhage, stroke, or other structural abnormalities that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms.

**Incorrect answer**: A. Cardiac catheterization

While cardiac catheterization may be necessary in the future to evaluate the patient's coronary arteries, it is not the most appropriate next step in this scenario. The patient's comatose state and recent cardiac arrest suggest that there may be a more immediate need to evaluate their neurological function.

**Incorrect answer**: C. Pulmonary computed tomography angiography

Pulmonary CT angiography may be necessary to evaluate the patient's pulmonary circulation, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this scenario. The patient's comatose state and recent cardiac arrest suggest that there may be a more immediate need to evaluate their neurological function.

**Incorrect answer**: D. Transesophageal echocardiography

Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) may be necessary to evaluate the patient's cardiac function and identify any potential cardiac causes of their symptoms.

The patient's history of smoking, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and hyperuricemia, combined with the absence of symptoms such as dysphonia or dysphagia, and the presence of a nodular cystic-appearing lesion on the posterior inferior border of the right vocal process, are all consistent with a diagnosis of laryngeal gout. The presence of submucosal white caseous debris in the substance of the lesion and the absence of overlying ulceration also support this diagnosis.

Laryngeal tuberculosis (choice A) is unlikely given the patient's lack of symptoms and the absence of any evidence of tuberculosis on the surgical specimen.

Vocal fold granuloma (choice C) is also unlikely given the patient's history and the appearance of the lesion. Granulomas are typically associated with chronic inflammation and would be more likely to cause symptoms such as dysphonia or dysphagia.

Laryngeal amyloidosis (choice D) is a rare condition that can cause vocal fold weakness or paralysis, but it is not typically associated with a nodular cystic-appearing lesion.

Therefore, based on the patient's history, symptoms, and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is laryngeal gout.

**Answer**:C. Kimura disease

The correct answer is C. Kimura disease, as it matches the given case's symptoms and laboratory results.

Kimura disease is a rare, benign condition characterized by the proliferation of lymphoid tissue, typically in the head and neck region. It presents with bilateral, painless swelling of the lymph nodes, often accompanied by pruritus, as in the given case. The patient's age, a farmer in his 50s, also fits the typical demographic of patients diagnosed with Kimura disease.

The laboratory results support the diagnosis of Kimura disease, as there is a mild eosinophilia and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), which are common findings in this condition. The absence of IgE level measurement is not significant, as Kimura disease is not associated with elevated IgE levels.

The other answer choices do not fit the case's symptoms and laboratory results:

A. Hodgkin lymphoma: This is a malignant lymphoma that typically presents with painless, bilateral lymphadenopathy. However, Hodgkin lymphoma is associated with systemic symptoms like fever, night sweats, and weight loss, which are not present in this case. Also, the patient's age is not typical for Hodgkin lymphoma, which is more common in younger adults.

B. Tubercular lymphadenitis: This is an infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which can present with bilateral lymphadenopathy. However, the patient's history and physical examination do not suggest any signs of tuberculosis infection, such as cough, fever, or weight loss. Moreover, the fine-needle aspiration cytology and incisional biopsy results were consistent with reactive lymphadenitis, which is not supportive of tubercular lymphadenitis.

**Answer**: C. Follicular dendritic cell sarcoma

The patient's symptoms, such as odynophagia, and the mass's location and growth, are consistent with a diagnosis of follicular dendritic cell sarcoma. The patient's history of Poland syndrome, which is a congenital condition characterized by underdeveloped or absent pectoral muscles, also supports this diagnosis. Follicular dendritic cell sarcoma is a rare type of cancer that typically affects the lymph nodes, but can also occur in other parts of the body, such as the oropharynx.

The positive immunohistochemical staining for CD4, CD21, CD23, and vimentin, with a low proliferation rate, is also consistent with a diagnosis of follicular dendritic cell sarcoma. Follicular dendritic cell sarcoma typically shows a fascicular or storiform pattern, as seen in the patient's biopsy, and the cells are positive for CD21 and CD23.

The other answer choices are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and test results. Poorly undifferentiated carcinoma would not typically show the same immunohistochemical staining pattern as follicular dendritic cell sarcoma, and would likely have a higher proliferation rate. Ectopic thymoma would not typically occur in the oropharynx and would not show the same immunohistochemical staining pattern. Peripheral nerve sheath tumor would not typically have the same fascicular or storiform pattern as follicular dendritic cell sarcoma, and would likely show a different immunohistochemical staining pattern.

The correct answer is A: Observe only.

The patient's symptoms of acute abdominal pain and tender abdomen without rigidity, along with the imaging findings of intussusception at the jejunojejunal anastomosis and a right adnexal mass, suggest that the patient's primary condition is related to the gastrointestinal tract. The presence of multiple lung nodules on the chest computed tomography scan does not necessarily indicate right-sided endocarditis, as the nodules are predominantly located in the lower lobes.

Option B, Perform cardiac echocardiography to rule out right-sided endocarditis, is not the most appropriate next step. While it is possible that the patient may have right-sided endocarditis, the imaging findings and symptoms do not strongly suggest this diagnosis. Additionally, cardiac echocardiography is not the most appropriate test to diagnose right-sided endocarditis, as it may not provide clear visualization of the right-sided heart structures.

Option C, Refer the patient to oncology for chemotherapy, is also not the most appropriate next step. While the patient's history of pulmonary thromboendarterectomy for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and the presence of multiple lung nodules may suggest a possible diagnosis of lung cancer, there is not enough information to confirm this diagnosis. Furthermore, chemotherapy is not typically the first line of treatment for lung cancer, and a biopsy or other diagnostic tests would be needed to confirm the diagnosis before starting treatment.

Option D, Start treatment with sirolimus, is also not the most appropriate next step. Sirolimus is an immunosuppressive drug that is commonly used to prevent rejection in organ transplant patients. While it has been used in some cases to treat lung cancer, it is not the most appropriate treatment for this patient's symptoms and imaging findings.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to observe the patient closely, monitor their symptoms, and consider further diagnostic tests or interventions as needed. This approach allows for careful evaluation of the patient's condition and ensures that any necessary

The correct answer is D: Prescribe a 12-month course of dapsone combined with rifampin.

Let's go through each of the answer choices and explain why they are incorrect or correct:

A: No further treatment is indicated.

This choice is incorrect because the patient has a hyperpigmented macule on her palm and diminished sensation, which suggests that there is an underlying condition that needs to be treated. Additionally, the patient has a history of traveling to Bangladesh, which increases the likelihood of her having leprosy. It's important to note that leprosy is a chronic condition that requires long-term treatment. Therefore, choice A is not the best option.

B: Perform a diagnostic biopsy of the hyperpigmented area and right ulnar nerve.

This choice is incorrect because while a biopsy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis, it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient has already had a biopsy done in Bangladesh, and the results showed multiple perineural granulomas with inflammatory cells. This suggests that the patient likely has leprosy, and further biopsies may not be necessary. Instead, the focus should be on treating the underlying condition.

C: Prescribe a 6-month course of isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide.

This choice is incorrect because while this treatment regimen is effective for treating tuberculosis, it is not the most appropriate treatment for leprosy. Leprosy requires a longer treatment course, typically 12-24 months, and the medications used are different from those used to treat tuberculosis.

D: Prescribe a 12-month course of dapsone combined with rifampin.

This choice is correct because dapsone and rifampin are both effective medications for treating leprosy. Dapsone is a first-line medication for leprosy and is often used in combination with other medications, such as rifampin, to treat the condition.

**Answer**: A. The patient has cirrhosis.

The patient's history of chronic hepatitis C genotype 1b infection for 5 years, along with the negative VCTE result prior to treatment (6.7 kPa), suggests that the patient likely had minimal fibrosis at that time. However, after treatment with simeprevir and sofosbuvir for 12 weeks, the patient's VCTE result increased to 9.4 kPa, which is above the normal range (6.7 kPa) and indicates significant fibrosis.

Given the patient's history of chronic hepatitis C infection and the increase in VCTE result, it is likely that the patient has developed cirrhosis. This is supported by the patient's elevated liver enzymes (ALT and AST) and low platelet count, which are common indicators of cirrhosis.

Therefore, choice A, "The patient has cirrhosis," is the correct answer.

Choices B and C are incorrect because they do not align with the patient's history and laboratory results. Choice B suggests that the patient has a healthy liver, which is not supported by the patient's history of chronic hepatitis C infection and elevated liver enzymes. Choice C suggests that the patient has minimal fibrosis, which is inconsistent with the patient's VCTE result of 9.4 kPa.

Choice D is also incorrect because, while it is true that the patient requires a liver biopsy to confirm fibrosis stage, this choice does not accurately reflect the patient's current condition based on the available information. The patient's history and laboratory results suggest that the patient has cirrhosis, rather than minimal fibrosis.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

**Answer**:B. The patient has masked uncontrolled hypertension.

The correct answer is B because the patient's 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) results show a mean BP level of 133/86 mm Hg, which is above the normal range of <130/80 mm Hg. Additionally, the patient experienced sudden increases in BP during the night, which could indicate masked uncontrolled hypertension.

The patient's office BP measurement of 127/74 mm Hg was within the normal range, but this does not necessarily mean that the patient has normal BP overall. ABPM is a more reliable indicator of BP control because it measures BP over a 24-hour period and can detect variations in BP that may not be captured by a single office measurement.

The patient's history of a non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and treatment with a drug-eluting stent also suggest that they are at risk for cardiovascular disease, which highlights the importance of careful BP management.

Now, let's discuss why the other answer choices are incorrect:

A. The patient has normal BP since the office BP was normal.

This choice is incorrect because, as mentioned earlier, a single office BP measurement may not accurately reflect the patient's overall BP control. The patient's ABPM results indicate that their BP is not well-controlled, even though their office BP was within the normal range.

C. The patient has white coat hypertension.

White coat hypertension refers to the phenomenon where a patient's BP is elevated due to anxiety or stress caused by being in a medical setting. The patient's history of anxiety and panic disorders may suggest that they are more likely to experience white coat hypertension. However, the patient's ABPM results show that their BP remains elevated outside of the office setting, which suggests that their hypertension is not solely due to white coat effect.

D. The patient’s BP dips appropriately during sleep.

This choice is incorrect because the patient's ABPM results show that their B

**Answer**:A. Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus

Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus (LSA) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by the development of atrophic, hyperpigmented, and pruritic patches, often on the flexural surfaces of the body, including the palms and soles. The patient's symptoms of a 2-year history of a pruritic and sometimes burning hyperpigmented eruption on the bilateral palms, with gradual spread to the volar aspect of the wrists, are consistent with LSA. The presence of well-marginated brown atrophic patches on the bilateral palms, extending focally onto the volar aspect of the wrist, and centrally surmounted by spiny keratotic pits in the palmar creases, further supports this diagnosis.

In contrast, acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (ACA) is a rare, chronic, inflammatory skin condition characterized by the development of atrophic, hypopigmented, and telangiectatic patches, typically on the distal extremities. While ACA can also present with hyperpigmentation, it is less common than LSA. Additionally, ACA typically has a more sudden onset and may be associated with systemic symptoms such as fever, joint pain, and fatigue, which are not mentioned in the patient's history.

Acquired palmoplantar keratoderma (APK) is a condition characterized by the development of thickened, hyperkeratotic skin on the palms and soles. While APK can also present with hyperpigmentation, it is typically associated with a different clinical appearance, with thickened, scaly skin and a more diffuse distribution.

Sclerotylosis (Huriez syndrome) is a rare, chronic skin condition characterized by the development of sclerotic, atrophic, and hypopigmented patches, often on the trunk and limbs. While it can also present with hyperpigmentation, the distribution and clinical appearance of the lesions in this case are not consistent with sclerotylosis.

**Answer**:A. Trichodysplasia spinulosa

Trichodysplasia spinulosa is a rare, benign, and chronic condition characterized by the development of numerous small, flesh-colored or white papules on the face, particularly on the cheeks, nose, and forehead. The papules are typically small, measuring around 1 mm in diameter, and have a characteristic spiky or thorn-like appearance. The condition is caused by abnormal differentiation of hair follicles, leading to the formation of numerous small hairs that fail to penetrate the epidermis and instead form small papules.

In this case, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with trichodysplasia spinulosa. The patient has a 1-year history of a facial cutaneous eruption that started on the malar cheeks and eyebrows and has since spread to the nose, chin, upper trunk, and extremities. The lesions are mildly pruritic and have a characteristic spiky appearance, which is consistent with trichodysplasia spinulosa. The patient's history of a cadaveric renal transplant and immunosuppressant medications, including mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus, may also contribute to the development of this condition.

The other choices are less likely diagnoses for this patient's condition:

B. Lichen spinulosus is a rare, benign condition characterized by the development of small, flesh-colored or white papules on the skin, particularly on the face, neck, and upper trunk. The papules are typically larger than those seen in trichodysplasia spinulosa and have a more irregular shape. Lichen spinulosus is not typically associated with immunosuppression or renal transplantation.

C. Demodecosis is a common condition caused by the infestation of the skin with the Demodex mite. It is characterized by the development of small, red, or flesh-colored papules on the face, particularly on the eyelids, nose, and cheeks. The papules are typically smaller than those seen in trichodysplasia spinulosa and have a more rounded shape.

**Answer**:B. Erythema papulosa semicircularis recidivans

The correct answer is B. Erythema papulosa semicircularis recidivans, as it matches the patient's symptoms and clinical presentation.

A. Granuloma annulare is an uncommon skin condition characterized by the development of small, flesh-colored or pink papules with a central crust that form a circular or semicircular shape. While the patient's lesion is also annular, it is much larger than the typical granuloma annulare lesion, and there is no central crust or scarring. Additionally, the patient's lesion has a distinctive papular border, which is not typical of granuloma annulare.

C. Deep erythema annulare centrifugum is a rare skin condition characterized by the development of large, painless, annular plaques on the trunk and extremities. While the patient's lesion is annular and located on the trunk, it does not have the characteristic deep red color of deep erythema annulare centrifugum, and there is no evidence of pain or discomfort.

D. Erythema chronicum migrans, also known as Lyme disease, is a bacterial infection caused by Borrelia burgdorferi that is transmitted through the bite of an infected Ixodes tick. While the patient's lesion has a similar appearance to the typical erythema migrans rash seen in Lyme disease, there is no history of tick exposure or other symptoms consistent with Lyme disease. Additionally, the patient's lesion has a distinctive papular border and central clearing, which is not typical of erythema migrans.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and clinical presentation, the most appropriate diagnosis is B. Erythema papulosa semicircularis recidivans.

**Answer**: D. Cobalt toxicity

The correct answer is D. Cobalt toxicity because the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with cobalt toxicity. Cobalt is a component of orthopedic hardware used in hip arthroplasty, and the patient has a history of hip arthroplasty with revisions. The patient's symptoms of bilateral vision and hearing loss, painful paresthesias in the feet, and polyneuropathy are consistent with cobalt toxicity. The laboratory results show elevated levels of cerebrospinal fluid protein and thyrotropin, which are also consistent with cobalt toxicity.

A. Neuromyelitis optica (Devic disease) is an autoimmune disease that affects the optic nerves and spinal cord. Although the patient's vision loss is consistent with this diagnosis, the absence of other symptoms such as myelitis and the presence of polyneuropathy make it less likely.

B. Amyloidosis is a condition where abnormal proteins accumulate in organs and tissues. Although the patient's symptoms of vision loss and polyneuropathy can be seen in amyloidosis, the absence of other symptoms such as kidney dysfunction and the presence of cobalt toxicity make it less likely.

C. Susac syndrome is a rare autoimmune disease that affects the retina and inner ear. Although the patient's vision and hearing loss are consistent with this diagnosis, the presence of polyneuropathy and the laboratory results do not support this diagnosis.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is D. Cobalt toxicity.

**Answer**:B. Colonic ischemia

The patient's symptoms of sudden-onset, constant, right lower quadrant abdominal pain associated with vomiting and melena, along with the laboratory results of leukocyte count, blood urea nitrogen level, creatinine concentration, lipase concentration, and lactate concentration, are consistent with colonic ischemia. The patient's history of polycystic ovarian syndrome, diabetes, stroke, and coronary artery disease may also increase the risk of colonic ischemia.

The patient's abdominal pain and vomiting suggest an obstruction or irritation of the gastrointestinal tract, which can be caused by colonic ischemia. The melena suggests that there is bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, which can be a result of colonic ischemia. The patient's hypertension and tachycardia suggest that there is a severe physiological stress, which can be caused by colonic ischemia.

The laboratory results show a high leukocyte count, which suggests an inflammatory response, and a high blood urea nitrogen level, which suggests kidney dysfunction, both of which are consistent with colonic ischemia. The high lipase concentration and lactate concentration suggest that there is pancreatic involvement, which can be caused by colonic ischemia.

The electrolyte levels and liver function test results being within normal limits suggest that there is no electrolyte imbalance or liver dysfunction, which can rule out other possible causes of abdominal pain, such as diverticulitis or infectious colitis.

The computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast enhancement showed segmental mural thickening of the anterior cecum with wall hypoenhancement and pneumatosis, adjacent fat stranding, and a lucency medial to the cecum, which suggests colonic ischemia.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is colonic ischemia.

The other choices are less likely diagnoses for the following reasons:

The correct answer is C. Perforation by foreign bodies.

Let's go through each answer choice and explain why it's incorrect or correct:

A. Rupture of an infected endometriotic implant:
Endometriosis is a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus, leading to inflammation and pain. While it's possible that an infected endometriotic implant could rupture and cause abdominal pain, the patient's symptoms and examination findings don't support this diagnosis. The patient doesn't have fever, and her abdomen is soft and nondistended, which suggests that there isn't any significant inflammation or peritonitis. Additionally, the patient's history of endometriosis and adenomyosis doesn't necessarily suggest a ruptured endometriotic implant.

B. Inflamed diverticulum:
Diverticulitis is a condition where small pouches form in the wall of the colon and become inflamed. While it's possible that an inflamed diverticulum could cause abdominal pain, the patient's symptoms and examination findings don't support this diagnosis. The patient's abdominal pain is sudden and severe, which doesn't fit with the typical gradual onset of symptoms in diverticulitis. Additionally, the patient's examination findings don't suggest any signs of peritonitis or inflammation in the colon.

D. Malignant growth with unknown primary tumor:
While it's possible that the patient's symptoms could be caused by a malignant growth, the patient's history and examination findings don't support this diagnosis. The patient's history of endometriosis and adenomyosis suggests a benign condition, and the patient's examination findings don't suggest any signs of malignancy. Additionally, the patient's elevated cancer antigen 125 level could be caused by various benign conditions, including endometriosis.

The correct answer is D. Perform a second lacrimal gland biopsy.

Let's go through each answer choice and explain why it's incorrect or correct:

A. Treat with oral corticosteroids:
Corticosteroids are commonly used to treat inflammatory conditions, but in this case, there's no evidence of an inflammatory process in the lacrimal gland. The biopsy results showed a chronic inflammatory infiltrate composed of T cells with scattered B cells and mature plasma cells, but no evidence of a lymphoproliferative process. Therefore, treating the patient with oral corticosteroids would not address the underlying cause of the swelling.

B. Treat with methotrexate sodium:
Methotrexate is a chemotherapy drug used to treat various conditions, including cancer and autoimmune diseases. However, in this case, there's no evidence of a lymphoproliferative process or malignancy. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a benign process, and methotrexate would not be an appropriate treatment.

C. Perform external beam radiotherapy to the orbit:
Radiotherapy is used to treat various conditions, including cancer and benign tumors. However, in this case, there's no evidence of a malignancy or a tumor that would require radiotherapy. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a benign process, and radiotherapy would not be an appropriate treatment.

D. Perform a second lacrimal gland biopsy:
The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a benign process, but the previous biopsy results were inconclusive. A second biopsy would be necessary to establish a definitive diagnosis and guide further management. This is the most appropriate answer choice.

In summary, the correct answer is D. Perform a second lacrimal gland biopsy, as it's the most appropriate step to establish a definitive diagnosis and guide further management. The other answer choices are not appropriate based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings.

**Answer**:B. Perform orbitotomy with excision

The correct answer is B, Perform orbitotomy with excision, because it is the most appropriate treatment option for a large compressible mass in the right orbit that is displacing the globe superiorly, as shown in the coronal T2-weighted magnetic resonance image.

Option A, Perform aspiration, is not the best choice because it may not be effective in removing the entire cyst, especially if it is large and compressible. Aspiration may also risk introducing infection into the orbit.

Option C, Administer radiotherapy, is not indicated for this condition. Radiotherapy is typically used to treat malignancies, and there is no evidence to suggest that this is a malignant lesion.

Option D, Administer intralesional corticosteroids, may be considered in some cases to reduce inflammation, but it would not be effective in removing the cyst. Intralesional corticosteroids may also have side effects, such as glaucoma, cataracts, and increased risk of infection.

Therefore, the best option is B, Perform orbitotomy with excision, which involves surgically removing the cyst and any affected tissue. This approach allows for complete removal of the lesion, reducing the risk of recurrence and improving the child's vision.

D. Perform serologic testing for Bartonella henselae and Francisella tularensis is the correct answer.

The patient's symptoms and history suggest possible exposure to Bartonella henselae or Francisella tularensis, which can cause ocular and systemic infections. The presence of granulomatous conjunctivitis and elevated inflammatory markers supports this suspicion. Serologic testing can help confirm the diagnosis and guide appropriate treatment.

The other options are not the most appropriate next steps in this situation:

A. Performing conjunctival cultures on various media may help identify the causative organism, but it is not the most urgent step in this case, given the patient's symptoms and history.

B. Repeated computed tomography of the orbits with contrast may be considered if there is a concern for orbital cellulitis or other orbital pathology, but it is not the most appropriate next step based on the patient's current symptoms and examination findings.

C. Providing reassurance that the diagnosis is typically self-limited may be appropriate for some viral conjunctivitis cases, but it is not the most appropriate response given the patient's history of exposure to a potentially infected animal and the presence of systemic symptoms.

Therefore, D. Performing serologic testing for Bartonella henselae and Francisella tularensis is the most appropriate next step in this case.

**Answer**:B. Indocyanine green angiography, fluorescein angiography, or both

The correct answer is B, Indocyanine green angiography, fluorescein angiography, or both, because it is the most appropriate next step in the evaluation of this patient's sudden-onset unilateral macular hemorrhage.

Indocyanine green angiography is a diagnostic test that uses a special dye and a camera to take pictures of the blood vessels in the retina. It can help identify any abnormalities in the retinal blood vessels, such as leakage or blockage, which can cause hemorrhages.

Fluorescein angiography is another diagnostic test that uses a special dye and a camera to take pictures of the blood vessels in the retina. It can help evaluate the circulation of the retinal blood vessels and identify any areas of leakage or blockage.

Both tests can provide valuable information in diagnosing and managing retinal vascular diseases, such as macular hemorrhage. They can help the clinician identify the underlying cause of the hemorrhage, such as a retinal vein occlusion, and guide treatment decisions.

Computed tomography of the brain (choice A) may be appropriate in some cases of sudden-onset visual loss, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as the patient's symptoms are localized to one eye and there is no evidence of a systemic condition that could be causing the hemorrhage.

B-scan ultrasonography (choice C) is a diagnostic test that uses high-frequency sound waves to produce images of the eye. It can help evaluate the structure of the eye and detect any abnormalities, such as a retinal detachment. However, it is not as sensitive as indocyanine green angiography or fluorescein angiography in detecting retinal vascular abnormalities, and therefore may not be the most appropriate next step in this case.

Autofluorescence (choice D) is a diagnostic test that uses a special light to stimulate the fluorescent properties of the retina. It can help evaluate the metabolic activity of the retinal cells and identify any areas

**Answer**:B. Obtain aqueous sample through needle aspirate for viral polymerase chain reaction, and start intravitreal and systemic antiviral therapy

The correct answer is B because it is the most appropriate step to diagnose and manage the patient's condition.

The patient's symptoms of sudden unilateral decreased vision, pain, and conjunctival hyperemia, along with the physical examination findings of keratic precipitates, cells in the anterior chamber, and retinal whitening and thickening with subretinal fluid, suggest a diagnosis of acute retinal necrosis (ARN). ARN is a severe and sight-threatening condition caused by a viral infection, most commonly herpes simplex virus (HSV).

Option B, obtaining an aqueous sample through needle aspirate for viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR), is the appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis of ARN and identify the causative virus. PCR is a highly sensitive and specific test for detecting viral DNA in the aqueous humor, and it can help guide treatment decisions.

Option A, initiating uveitis workup and starting topical corticosteroid therapy, may be appropriate for managing uveitis associated with ARN, but it is not the most urgent step in the patient's management.

Option C, performing a lumbar puncture, is not necessary for diagnosing ARN and may not be appropriate given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

Option D, performing pars plana vitrectomy, is a surgical procedure that may be considered for managing severe cases of ARN, but it is not the most appropriate next step in the patient's management.

Therefore, the correct answer is B, obtaining an aqueous sample through needle aspirate for viral PCR, and starting intravitreal and systemic antiviral therapy to treat the patient's ARN.

**D. Perform pars plana vitrectomy with endolaser** is the correct answer.

The patient has a history of ocular hypertension, chronic retinal detachment, and recurrent macula-on retinal detachment, which suggests that the vitreous is still active and causing trouble. The yellowish subfoveal precipitates, also known as vitelliform lesions, are a sign of chronic inflammation and are likely a result of the persistent subretinal fluid.

Option A, observing the patient, is not sufficient given the patient's history and current symptoms. The patient has already undergone multiple surgeries, and the lesions are still present, indicating that observation alone may not be enough to resolve the issue.

Option B, administering intravitreal corticosteroid injection, may help reduce inflammation, but it may not address the underlying cause of the vitelliform lesions, which is likely related to the persistent subretinal fluid.

Option C, performing laser photocoagulation, may help reduce the risk of further retinal detachment, but it may not be effective in removing the existing vitelliform lesions.

Option D, performing pars plana vitrectomy with endolaser, is the most appropriate choice. This procedure can remove the vitreous and any associated inflammatory cells, reducing the risk of further retinal detachment and allowing the retina to reattach properly. The endolaser can also help to reduce the risk of recurrent vitreous hemorrhage.

Therefore, option D is the best answer.

**Answer**: D. Mucormycosis

Explanation:
Mucormycosis is a rare and severe opportunistic fungal infection caused by Mucorales, which typically affects immunocompromised patients, such as those with hematologic malignancies, undergoing intensive chemotherapy or radiation therapy. The patient's history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and current induction therapy with intravenous cytarabine, vincristine sulfate, dexamethasone, pegaspargase, and intrathecal methotrexate, puts her at high risk for opportunistic infections.

The patient's skin lesion, described as a 4.0 × 2.0-cm, oval-shaped violaceous to black plaque with a central hemorrhagic bulla and surrounding hyperemia on the left lower back, is consistent with the cutaneous manifestations of mucormycosis. The presence of a central hemorrhagic bulla and surrounding hyperemia suggests necrotic and vasculitic changes, which are typical of mucormycosis.

The patient's blood glucose level of 326 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555) is also consistent with the diagnosis of mucormycosis, as hyperglycemia is a common finding in patients with this infection.

The patient's absolute neutrophil count of 36/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001) and platelet count of 10 × 103/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 1) are low, which is consistent with bone marrow suppression caused by intensive chemotherapy and radiation therapy, and also increases the risk of opportunistic infections.

Therefore, based on the patient's history, physical examination findings, and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is mucormycosis.

The other choices are less likely explanations for the patient's skin lesion and clinical presentation:

**Answer**: A. Perform fluoroscopy

The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and fatigue, along with the physical examination findings of jugular venous pressure of 13 cm H2O, crisp mechanical S1 heart sound, and pitting edema in the lower extremities, suggest neurological dysfunction. The transthoracic echocardiogram showed no pericardial effusion, normal left ventricular systolic function, a well-seated mitral valve prosthesis with normal gradients, a dilated and diffusely hypokinetic right ventricle, and an elevated mean tricuspid valve gradient. These findings suggest that the patient has pulmonary hypertension, which can be caused by several factors, including antiphospholipid syndrome.

Given the patient's history of mechanical mitral and tricuspid valve replacements, it is important to evaluate the prosthetic valves to ensure that they are functioning properly. Fluoroscopy is the appropriate test to assess the mechanical valves and rule out any potential complications such as valve thrombosis or malfunction.

The other options are not appropriate for the following reasons:

B. Obtain a computed tomographic pulmonary angiogram: While a CT pulmonary angiogram may be useful in evaluating the lung parenchyma and vasculature, it would not provide information about the mechanical valves.

C. Perform right heart catheterization: Right heart catheterization may be necessary in some cases of pulmonary hypertension, but it is not the most appropriate test in this scenario. The patient's history of mechanical valves and the elevated mean tricuspid valve gradient suggest that the pulmonary hypertension is likely due to prosthetic valve dysfunction, which can be evaluated with fluoroscopy.

D. Perform coronary angiography: Coronary angiography is not relevant to the patient's symptoms or physical examination findings. The patient's history of rheumatic heart disease and mechanical valve replacements suggests that the pulmonary hypertension is more likely due to prosthetic valve dys

**Answer**:B. The patient’s hemostatic status is not appropriate for surgery because the abnormal PT suggests anticoagulant effect from rivaroxaban.

The correct answer is B because the patient's abnormal PT (partial thromboplastin time) suggests that there is still an anticoagulant effect from rivaroxaban, which could increase the risk of bleeding during surgery. The aPTT (activated partial thromboplastin time) is normal, but this test is less sensitive to the effects of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) like rivaroxaban. The PT, on the other hand, is more sensitive to DOACs and can detect their effects even when the aPTT is normal. Therefore, choice B is the correct answer.

Choice A is incorrect because, although the aPTT is normal, the PT is abnormal, indicating that there is still anticoagulant activity present. Choice C is incorrect because the thrombin clotting time is not provided in the question, and it would not be useful in assessing the anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban. Choice D is incorrect because the INR (international normalized ratio) is not provided in the question, and it would not be useful in assessing the anticoagulant effect of rivaroxaban, which is a DOAC and not a vitamin K antagonist.

**Answer**: D. Perform further evaluation for subclinical hypercortisolism.

The correct answer is D because the patient's history and laboratory results suggest the possibility of subclinical hypercortisolism, which is a condition where the patient has excess cortisol levels but does not display the typical symptoms of Cushing's syndrome. The patient's history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia increases the likelihood of subclinical hypercortisolism. The laboratory results show a slightly elevated cortisol level, which supports this diagnosis.

Option A is incorrect because it suggests no further biochemical evaluation, which would not be appropriate given the patient's history and laboratory results.

Option B is incorrect because a 24-hour urine measurement of catecholamines would not be helpful in diagnosing subclinical hypercortisolism. Catecholamines are not produced in excess in this condition, and their levels would not help differentiate between subclinical hypercortisolism and other conditions.

Option C is incorrect because an oral sodium load test for hyperaldosteronism would not be appropriate for this patient. Hyperaldosteronism is a condition where the patient has excess aldosterone levels, which can cause hypertension, hypokalemia, and hypernatremia. While the patient does have hypertension, there is no evidence to suggest hyperaldosteronism, and an oral sodium load test would not help diagnose subclinical hypercortisolism.

Therefore, the best answer is D, Perform further evaluation for subclinical hypercortisolism, which would include additional laboratory tests and imaging studies to confirm the diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment.

Q: What is your diagnosis for the patient described in the case?
A: C. Cytomegalovirus ulcers

The patient's symptoms of vulvar and buttock pain, along with the physical examination findings of tender ulcers on the vulva and buttocks, are consistent with cytomegalovirus (CMV) ulcers. CMV is a viral infection that can cause ulcers on the skin and mucous membranes, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. The patient's recent hospitalization for pneumonia and admission to the intensive care unit suggest that she may have been immunocompromised, which could have made her more susceptible to CMV infection.

The biopsy specimen obtained from the left vulvar ulcer showed histopathologic features consistent with CMV infection, including intranuclear inclusions and multinucleated cells. These findings support the diagnosis of CMV ulcers.

The other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Fixed drug eruption (choice A) is a type of adverse drug reaction that can cause skin lesions, but it is not typically associated with vulvar or buttock ulcers. Cutaneous candidiasis (choice B) is a fungal infection of the skin, but it does not typically cause painful ulcers on the vulva and buttocks. Genital herpes simplex virus infection (choice D) can cause ulcers on the genitalia, but the patient's lack of a history of sexual activity and the absence of other symptoms such as fever, headache, or meningism make this diagnosis less likely.

A. Chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CCLE): CCLE is a chronic autoimmune disease that can cause malar erythema, but it typically presents with a more widespread distribution, including the scalp, ears, and extensor surfaces. The patient's localized involvement of the cheeks and nasal bridge, along with the absence of other systemic symptoms, makes CCLE less likely.

B. Granuloma faciale: Granuloma faciale is a rare condition characterized by the development of granulomas on the face. It may present with erythematous to violaceous papules or nodules, but the absence of a history of facial trauma and the lack of granulomas on biopsy make this diagnosis less likely.

D. Rosacea-like dermatitis: Rosacea-like dermatitis can present with facial erythema and inflammation, but it typically has a more sudden onset and may be associated with telangiectasias, papules, and pustules. The patient's persistent and progressive course, along with the absence of these characteristic features, makes rosacea-like dermatitis less likely.

Now, let's discuss why C. Neutrophilic sebaceous adenitis is the correct answer:

Neutrophilic sebaceous adenitis is a rare inflammatory condition that affects the sebaceous glands, leading to their destruction and subsequent atrophy. It typically presents with persistent, asymptomatic facial erythema, often with a malar distribution, which is consistent with the patient's presentation. The patient's history of treatment resistance and the progression of the disease, along with the presence of focal areas of atrophy, further support this diagnosis.

The histopathological findings also support this diagnosis, as they show a

**Answer**:C. Annular erythema of infancy

The correct answer is C. Annular erythema of infancy because it matches the clinical presentation described in the case. Annular erythema of infancy is a benign, self-limiting condition characterized by the development of annular, serpiginous, or polycyclic erythematous plaques on the skin of young children. The lesions typically wax and wane, with each episode lasting for approximately 1 week, without residual pigmentation. This is consistent with the patient's history of an asymptomatic expanding erythematous eruption on the lower legs, abdomen, and buttocks that would wax and wane, with each episode lasting for approximately 1 week, without residual pigmentation.

The patient's age and the absence of any family history of autoimmune disease also support this diagnosis. Annular erythema of infancy typically affects children under the age of 2 years and is rare in older children and adults. Additionally, there is no mention of any fevers or exposures to ticks or other arthropods, which would make Lyme disease (choice D) less likely.

The histopathological findings of perivascular and inflammatory infiltrate with eosinophils (shown in Figure, B and C) are also consistent with annular erythema of infancy. The infiltrate is composed of lymphocytes, histiocytes, and eosinophils, which is characteristic of this condition.

In contrast, tinea corporis (choice A) is a fungal infection that can cause annular lesions, but it typically presents with scaly, raised borders, and the patient would have had to have been exposed to the fungus. Erythema marginatum (choice B) is a condition characterized by the development of erythematous lesions on the skin, but it is typically associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, and there is no mention of any other symptoms or signs suggestive of this condition. Erythema migrans (choice D) is the skin manifestation of Lyme disease, which is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, and

**Answer**: B. Referral for outpatient exposure and response prevention therapy

The correct answer is B because the patient's symptoms of severe intractable contamination-based obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) have not responded to multiple medication trials, including SSRIs and antipsychotics. Exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy is a type of psychotherapy that has been shown to be effective in treating OCD, particularly in cases where medication has been ineffective. ERP therapy helps individuals gradually confront their fears and anxieties while learning to prevent compulsive behaviors.

In contrast, choice A, referral for transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), may be a viable option for treatment-resistant OCD, but it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient given the history of failed medication trials and the absence of any mention of TMS in the case description.

Choice C, referral for deep brain stimulation, is an invasive procedure that is typically reserved for treatment-resistant OCD patients who have not responded to other treatment options, including ERP therapy. While deep brain stimulation can be effective in some cases, it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient given the lack of information about her response to other treatments.

Choice D, pharmacotherapy with memantine augmentation of SSRI, may be a viable option for some patients with OCD, but it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient given the history of failed medication trials and the lack of any mention of memantine in the case description.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step for this patient would be referral for outpatient exposure and response prevention therapy, which has the potential to help her manage her symptoms and improve her quality of life.

**Answer**:D. Anti-Ma2 encephalitis

The patient's symptoms of subacute progressive ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, gait instability, and cognitive changes, along with the negative results for acetylcholine receptor antibodies and the muscle-specific kinase antibody, and the unremarkable electrodiagnostic test results, suggest a diagnosis of Anti-Ma2 encephalitis. This is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the nervous system and is associated with the presence of anti-Ma2 antibodies in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid. The patient's cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed a mild pleocytosis with a predominance of lymphocytes, which is consistent with Anti-Ma2 encephalitis. The negative results for thyrotropin, thiamine level, Lyme antibodies, rapid plasma reagin, and the serum ganglioside antibody panel also support this diagnosis.

The T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensities in the right thalamus, inferior temporal gyrus, and hippocampus, which developed intervally, are consistent with the imaging findings in Anti-Ma2 encephalitis.

Myasthenia gravis (choice A) can present with ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and gait instability, but the presence of cognitive changes, cerebrospinal fluid pleocytosis, and negative results for acetylcholine receptor antibodies and muscle-specific kinase antibody make it less likely.

Wernicke encephalopathy (choice B) can present with cognitive changes, ataxia, and ophthalmoplegia, but the presence of ptosis, gait instability, and negative results for thiamine level and rapid plasma reagin make it less likely.

**Answer**: B. Bronchopulmonary sequestration

Bronchopulmonary sequestration (BPS) is a congenital lung malformation where a portion of the lung tissue is not properly connected to the tracheobronchial tree and receives its blood supply from an anomalous systemic artery. This anomaly can result in a variety of symptoms, including respiratory distress, coughing, and difficulty breathing.

In this case, the prenatal ultrasound findings of a large left-sided hydrothorax, mediastinal shift, and ascites suggested a possible congenital lung malformation. The postnatal diagnosis of a feeding vessel originating from the descending aorta supplying a lung mass, as seen on both ultrasonography and computed tomography, is consistent with BPS. The patient's symptoms of respiratory distress and the need for a temporary thoracostomy tube also support this diagnosis.

The other answer choices do not fit the patient's symptoms and diagnosis:

A. Teratoma: A teratoma is a type of benign tumor that can occur in the lung, but it is not associated with a feeding vessel from the descending aorta.

C. Congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM): CPAM is a broad term that encompasses a range of congenital lung malformations, including BPS. However, the specific symptoms and diagnostic findings in this case are more consistent with BPS than CPAM.

D. Carcinoma: Carcinoma is a type of malignant tumor that can occur in the lung, but it is not associated with a feeding vessel from the descending aorta. In addition, the patient's age and symptoms do not suggest a malignancy.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Bronchopulmonary sequestration.

The correct answer is C. Wedge biopsy of lesion.

A. Clinical observation is not sufficient to diagnose the suspicious eyelid lesion. While observing the patient's symptoms and medical history can provide some information, a biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

B. Shave biopsy of lesion may not be the best choice because it may not provide a large enough sample for histopathological examination, and it may not be able to diagnose the lesion accurately.

D. Epilate the misdirected lashes and return in 3 months is not the best choice because it does not address the underlying cause of the lesion. The patient's symptoms have not improved with previous treatment, and simply removing the misdirected lashes may not be enough to resolve the issue.

Therefore, the best choice is C. Wedge biopsy of lesion, which allows for a larger sample of tissue to be removed and examined histopathologically, providing a more accurate diagnosis and guide for further management.

**Answer**:B. Diagnostic anterior chamber paracentesis with intravitreal injection of foscarnet sodium

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of blurry vision, bilateral optic nerve edema with disc hemorrhages, and peripheral retinal whitening, along with the presence of Candida glabrata in the blood cultures, suggest a possible diagnosis of fungal optic neuropathy. Fungal optic neuropathy is an infrequent but potentially devastating complication of fungemia, and early diagnosis and treatment are critical to prevent irreversible visual loss.

Option B, diagnostic anterior chamber paracentesis with intravitreal injection of foscarnet sodium, is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient. Foscarnet sodium is an antifungal medication that is effective against Candida species and has been shown to improve visual outcomes in patients with fungal optic neuropathy. Intravitreal injection of foscarnet sodium can help to quickly deliver the medication to the affected area and reduce the risk of systemic side effects. Anterior chamber paracentesis can help to confirm the diagnosis by identifying fungal elements in the aqueous humor.

Option A, intravitreal injection of amphotericin B, is not the best choice as it is less effective against Candida species compared to Foscarnet sodium and has a higher risk of systemic side effects.

Option C, diagnostic vitrectomy, may be considered in cases where there is uncertainty about the diagnosis or if there is evidence of vitreous inflammation, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case as the diagnosis of fungal optic neuropathy is already suspected, and vitrectomy may not provide a clear view of the optic nerve.

Option D, stereotactic radiation therapy to the optic nerve, is not appropriate for the treatment of fungal optic neuropathy and may even worsen the visual outcome.

Therefore, option B, diagnostic anterior chamber paracentesis with intravitreal injection of foscarnet sodium, is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient.

**Answer**:B. Serologic workup

The patient's symptoms of 3 weeks of a drooping left eyelid, marked proptosis of his left eye, and left-sided hypoglobus, along with the physical examination findings of left-sided proptosis, hypoglobus, and restriction in upgaze, suggest a possible diagnosis of myasthenia gravis (MG). MG is an autoimmune disorder that affects the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction, leading to muscle weakness and fatigue.

Serologic workup (choice B) is the next step in the diagnostic evaluation of this patient. Laboratory tests can help support the diagnosis of MG by identifying the presence of antibodies against the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) or against the muscle-specific tyrosine kinase (MuSK). The presence of antibodies against AChR is highly specific for MG, and their levels can be used to monitor the response to treatment.

Imaging studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits with and without contrast (choice A), may be useful in identifying structural abnormalities in the orbit, such as an orbital mass or enlargement of the extraocular muscles, but they are not specific for the diagnosis of MG. MRI may also be used to evaluate for other potential causes of proptosis and hypoglobus, such as an orbital tumor or inflammation. However, MRI is not the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic evaluation of this patient, as the clinical presentation and physical examination findings are highly suggestive of MG.

Chest CT (choice C) may be used to evaluate for other potential causes of MG, such as a thymoma or other mediastinal masses, but it is not the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic evaluation of this patient.

Observation (choice D) is not a suitable option, as the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a potentially treatable condition. Delaying diagnosis and treatment may lead to unnecessary morbidity and potential complications from untreated

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is C. Inject a sterile air bubble.

The explanation for this choice is as follows:

After the iridectomy, the anterior chamber shallowed, making it difficult to assess its depth and stability. Injecting a sterile air bubble into the anterior chamber can help to deepen it and provide a clearer view of the chamber, allowing the surgeon to assess its depth and stability more accurately. This is a common technique used in ophthalmic surgery to help evaluate the anterior chamber and prevent complications such as shallow chamber or hypotony.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Apply fibrin glue to all surgical wounds: Fibrin glue is used to seal surgical wounds and prevent bleeding, but it is not appropriate in this case because the shallowing of the anterior chamber is not due to bleeding.

B. Inflate the anterior chamber with ophthalmic viscosurgical device: Inflating the anterior chamber with a viscosurgical device can help to deepen it, but it may not be effective in this case because the corneal opacity precludes accurate assessment of the chamber depth and stability.

D. Tilt the microscope for better visualization of the anterior chamber: Tilting the microscope can help to improve visualization of the anterior chamber, but it will not address the underlying issue of the shallow chamber.

Therefore, the best answer is C. Inject a sterile air bubble.

**Answer**:D. Order an electroretinogram and a multifocal electroretinogram

The patient's symptoms of rapidly declining vision in both eyes, with normal examination findings, raise suspicion for a retinal or optic nerve disorder. The patient's history of systemic lupus erythematosus and cystic fibrosis increases the likelihood of an autoimmune or inflammatory condition.

A. Stopping the hydroxychloroquine is not the next step, as there is no evidence of retinal toxicity or any other adverse effect from the medication.

B. Performing a lumbar puncture because of suspicion of an infectious process is not the next step, as there is no evidence of meningitis or encephalitis.

C. Ordering spinal cord imaging because of suspicion of neuromyelitis optica is not the next step, as there is no evidence of myelitis or optic neuritis.

D. Ordering an electroretinogram and a multifocal electroretinogram is the appropriate next step, as it will help to evaluate the function of the retina and optic nerve, and can help to diagnose conditions such as retinal degeneration or dysfunction, including retinitis pigmentosa, cone-rod dystrophy, and central serous chorioretinopathy. Additionally, it can help to rule out other conditions such as amblyopia or other visual pathway disorders.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Order an electroretinogram and a multifocal electroretinogram.

**Answer**:C. Perform a biopsy of the mass

The correct answer is C. Perform a biopsy of the mass because it is the most appropriate step to establish a definitive diagnosis of the orbital mass. The patient's history of progressive, painless proptosis and the MRI findings of a heterogeneously hyperintense mass with a cystic component and avid peripheral contrast enhancement suggest a possibility of a neoplastic process, which could be benign or malignant. The radiologist's impression that the mass does not have the typical appearance of a vascular malformation or a schwannoma further supports the need for a tissue diagnosis.

Observing and performing another MRI in 6 months (option A) may not be sufficient to establish a definitive diagnosis, as the mass may not change significantly in size or appearance over time, and may not provide enough information to differentiate between a benign or malignant process.

Empirically treating with an antiparasitic agent (option B) is not appropriate, as there is no evidence to suggest that the mass is related to a parasitic infection. Moreover, such treatment may not be effective against other types of neoplastic processes.

Performing a whole-body positron emission tomography (option D) may not be necessary at this stage, as the MRI findings are already suggestive of a localized orbital mass, and a biopsy would provide more specific information about the nature of the mass. Additionally, a whole-body PET scan may not be able to detect a small, localized mass in the orbit.

Therefore, option C, Perform a biopsy of the mass, is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's condition.

**Answer**:B. Tenosynovial giant cell tumor

The patient's symptoms, along with the imaging findings, suggest a soft-tissue tumor in the ankle joint. The high uptake of FDG on PET suggests a malignant lesion. Tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT) is a rare, benign soft-tissue tumor that typically affects the synovial membrane of joints, tendons, and bursae. TGCTs are known to have a high uptake of FDG on PET, which can mimic malignancy.

A ganglion cyst (choice A) is a benign, fluid-filled sac that arises from the joint or tendon sheath. It is usually round or oval in shape and does not have the same imaging characteristics as a soft-tissue mass.

Ewing sarcoma (choice C) is a malignant tumor that can arise in the soft tissues of the extremities, including the ankle joint. However, the patient's age and the absence of any other symptoms or signs of metastasis make it less likely.

Synovial sarcoma (choice D) is a rare, malignant tumor that arises in the soft tissues of the extremities, including the ankle joint. It can have a similar imaging appearance to TGCT, but it is more aggressive and has a worse prognosis.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is Tenosynovial giant cell tumor.

**Answer**:B. Administer unfractioned heparin and bridge to warfarin

The patient's symptoms and echocardiography results suggest that he has developed bioprosthetic aortic stenosis, which is a known complication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR). The nodular filling defects along all of the leaflets with restricted excursion seen on 4-dimensional computed tomography (4-D CT) angiography indicate that the bioprosthetic valve is not functioning properly.

The correct answer is B, Administer unfractioned heparin and bridge to warfarin, because the patient has a high risk of stroke due to the presence of a mechanical valve and the development of bioprosthetic aortic stenosis. Unfractioned heparin is a fast-acting anticoagulant that can quickly prevent further clot formation and prevent stroke. Warfarin, a vitamin K antagonist, can also be used as a long-term anticoagulant to prevent stroke in patients with mechanical valves.

Answer A, Obtain blood culture samples and administer combination cefazolin, rifampin, and gentamicin, is incorrect because there is no indication of endocarditis or bacterial infection in the patient's symptoms or laboratory results.

Answer C, Increase the aspirin dosage to 325 mg daily, discontinue clopidogrel, and administer ticagrelor, is incorrect because aspirin and clopidogrel are antiplatelet agents that are used to prevent platelet aggregation and are not effective in preventing stroke in patients with mechanical valves. Ticagrelor, a P2Y12 inhibitor, can also be used as an antiplatelet agent, but it is not as effective as warfarin in preventing stroke in patients with mechanical valves.

**Answer**:C. Collagenous fibroma

The patient's symptoms, such as a slow-growing mass in the neck and facial area, unilateral conductive hearing loss, and a firm, non-mobile tumor that extends from the postauricular region to the parotid gland, scalp, and a portion of the neck, are consistent with a collagenous fibroma. Additionally, the microscopic findings of a paucicellular spindle cell neoplasm with an abundant myxocollagenous matrix and scattered tumor cells that are spindle-shaped and have the morphology of myofibroblasts, as well as the rare vessels and focal infiltration of subcutaneous fat and skeletal muscle, are also consistent with a collagenous fibroma.

Desmoid-type fibromatosis (choice A) is a rare benign tumor that can occur in the soft tissues of the head and neck, but it typically has a more aggressive clinical course and a higher recurrence rate than collagenous fibroma. Neurofibroma (choice B) is a benign tumor that originates from the peripheral nerves, but it typically has a more nodular and pedunculated appearance than the mass described in the case. Solitary fibrous tumor (choice D) is a rare benign tumor that can occur in the soft tissues of the head and neck, but it typically has a more hemorrhagic and variably cellular appearance than the mass described in the case. Therefore, choice C, collagenous fibroma, is the most appropriate diagnosis for this patient.

**Answer**:B. Perform esophageal (Heller) myotomy and partial fundoplication.

The correct answer is B because the patient's symptoms of retrosternal burning, heartburn, and regurgitation while supine, as well as intermittent solid-food dysphagia, suggest a diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with a possible component of esophageal motor dysfunction. The patient's symptoms persist despite taking omeprazole, which suggests that acid reflux is not the sole cause of his symptoms.

Esophageal high-resolution manometry (HRM) study, which was performed, can help diagnose esophageal motor dysfunction, such as achalasia or jackhammer esophagus. However, in this case, the HRM study results are not provided in the scenario, so we cannot determine the exact cause of the patient's symptoms.

Option A, performing 360-degree (Nissen) fundoplication, is not the best choice because it is a more invasive procedure that is typically reserved for patients with severe GERD symptoms and evidence of esophageal damage. The patient's symptoms do not suggest severe GERD, and there is no mention of esophageal damage.

Option C, increasing omeprazole dosing to twice daily, may help alleviate the patient's symptoms, but it does not address the possible component of esophageal motor dysfunction.

Option D, replacing omeprazole with nortriptyline, is not a appropriate choice because nortriptyline is an antidepressant that is sometimes used to treat gastroparesis, but it is not used to treat GERD or esophageal motor dysfunction.

Therefore, the best choice is option B, performing esophageal (Heller) myotomy and partial fundoplication, which is a minimally invasive procedure that can help alleviate symptoms of GERD and esophageal motor dysfunction by relaxing the lower esophageal sphincter and improving esophageal emptying.

**Answer**: B. Pyoderma gangrenosum

Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare, ulcerative skin condition that is often associated with underlying systemic diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, hematological malignancies, and autoimmune disorders. The clinical presentation of pyoderma gangrenosum typically involves the rapid development of painful, necrotic ulcers on the skin, often with a characteristic "punched-out" or "cribriform" appearance. The ulcers are usually located on the legs, buttocks, or perineum.

In this case, the 8-month-old male infant presented with a rapidly progressive, painful anogenital ulcer that developed over 48 hours, starting as symmetric pink patches leading to pustules, erosions, and ulceration. The ulcer had a cribriform base, central necrosis, and rolled, pink-to-violaceous, undermined border, which is consistent with the characteristic appearance of pyoderma gangrenosum. The absence of fevers, chills, or other systemic symptoms, as well as the lack of relevant family medical history, suggests that the condition is unlikely to be related to an underlying systemic disease.

The other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's condition:

A. Fournier gangrene is a necrotizing fasciitis of the genital region that is typically caused by a polymicrobial infection. While the patient's ulcer had a similar appearance to Fournier gangrene, the absence of systemic symptoms and the negative microbial cultures make it less likely.

C. Severe irritant contact dermatitis (chemical burn) is a possibility, but the rapid progression and characteristic appearance of the ulcer make it less likely.

D. Acquired acrodermatitis enteropathica is a rare condition that is associated with zinc deficiency. While the patient's serum zinc level was within normal limits, this condition is unlikely given the patient's age and lack of other symptoms.

**Answer**:A. Borderline-borderline leprosy

The correct answer is A, Borderline-borderline leprosy, because it most closely matches the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

Borderline-borderline leprosy is a rare variant of leprosy that is characterized by a few skin lesions, usually on the trunk and limbs, with a borderline number of skin smears positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). The patient's symptoms of polymorphic erythematous macules and plaques with elevated and indurated borders without evanescence to pressure, as well as the histopathological analysis of a chronic dermic granulomatous process and a chronic dermic nonencapsulated granulomatous infiltrate with a perineural distribution, are consistent with this diagnosis.

The patient's history of treatment with antihistamines and oral corticosteroids without improvement also supports this diagnosis, as Borderline-borderline leprosy can be resistant to standard treatments for leprosy.

The other answer choices do not match the patient's symptoms and laboratory results as closely:

B. Mycosis fungoides is a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that typically presents with patches or plaques on the skin, but the patient's lesions are not typical of this condition.

C. Disseminated annular granuloma is a rare condition characterized by annular plaques on the skin, but the patient's lesions do not have the characteristic annular shape.

D. Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease that can cause skin lesions, but the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not support this diagnosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is A, Borderline-borderline leprosy.

**Answer**: C. Porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus

The correct answer is C, Porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus, because it matches the clinical presentation and distribution of the lesions described in the case.

A. Epidermal nevus does not fit the clinical presentation of linear hyperkeratotic papules and plaques on the right arm and dorsal hand, distributed in a Blaschkoid pattern. Epidermal nevi are typically solitary or few in number, and are not usually distributed in a specific pattern.

B. Linear porokeratosis is a possibility, but it typically presents with more prominent scaling and crusting, and the lesions are usually more numerous and widespread. Additionally, linear porokeratosis does not typically follow a Blaschkoid pattern.

D. Linear Darier disease is a rare condition characterized by linear, hyperpigmented, and slightly raised lesions on the trunk and limbs. However, it typically does not present with the same degree of keratosis and scaling as seen in this case.

C. Porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus, on the other hand, is a rare variant of porokeratosis that affects the eccrine sweat glands and dermal ducts. It typically presents with linear, hyperkeratotic papules and plaques on the trunk and limbs, often following a Blaschkoid pattern. The presence of numerous reddish punctate keratotic papules on the patient’s right forearm that coalesce into plaques on the dorsum of her right hand, as well as the absence of extracutaneous abnormalities, supports this diagnosis.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation and distribution of the lesions, the most likely diagnosis is Porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus.

**Answer**: B. Cavernous sinus syndrome

The patient's symptoms of painless proptosis, upper eyelid ptosis, and ophthalmoplegia of the left eye, along with the physical examination findings of periorbital swelling and abnormal pupillary reaction, are consistent with cavernous sinus syndrome. This condition occurs when there is compression or inflammation of the cavernous sinus, a group of veins in the skull that drain blood from the brain and orbit. The cavernous sinus is located near the orbital apex, and compression or inflammation of the sinus can cause symptoms affecting the eye and surrounding tissues.

Option A, thyroid eye disease, is an autoimmune disorder that can cause proptosis, lid retraction, and ophthalmoplegia, but it is not typically associated with painless proptosis or periorbital swelling.

Option C, orbital apex syndrome, is a condition that occurs when there is compression or inflammation of the orbital apex, which can cause symptoms similar to those described in the patient's history. However, in orbital apex syndrome, the pupillary reaction is typically abnormal in both eyes, rather than just in one eye as in this case.

Option D, orbital cellulitis, is an infection of the orbit that can cause proptosis, lid swelling, and ophthalmoplegia. However, in orbital cellulitis, the patient would typically have symptoms such as pain, redness, and swelling of the affected eye, which are not mentioned in the patient's history. Additionally, the patient's pupillary reaction would likely be abnormal in both eyes, rather than just in one eye.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is cavernous sinus syndrome.

**Answer**:B. Atrioesophageal fistula

The patient's symptoms of acute-onset aphasia, right-sided hemiplegia, and fever, along with the laboratory results of elevated white blood cell count and the presence of Streptococcus mitis in the blood cultures, suggest a diagnosis of bacterial endocarditis. However, the patient's history of a recent thoracoscopic ablative procedure for refractory atrial fibrillation and the presence of pneumocephalus on the head computed tomography (CT) scan suggest a possible complication related to the procedure.

Atrioesophageal fistula (choice B) is the correct diagnosis because it can explain the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, as well as the presence of pneumocephalus on the CT scan. An atrioesophageal fistula is a rare complication of atrial fibrillation ablation procedures, and it occurs when the ablation procedure creates a connection between the atrium and the esophagus. This can lead to the introduction of bacteria from the esophagus into the bloodstream, causing bacterial endocarditis. The patient's symptoms of aphasia and hemiplegia are consistent with a stroke caused by a septic embolus from the bacterial endocarditis.

Cardioembolic stroke from atrial fibrillation (choice A) is an incorrect diagnosis because the patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a more recent event, and the presence of pneumocephalus on the CT scan suggests a different etiology.

Patent foramen ovale and paradoxical embolus (choice C) is an unlikely diagnosis because the patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a more severe event, and the presence of pneumocephalus on the CT scan suggests a different etiology.

Bacterial endocarditis (choice D) is an incorrect diagnosis because, although the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with bacterial endocarditis, the presence of pneumocephalus on the CT scan suggests a different etiology.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is D. Scrotal cystocele. A scrotal cystocele is a type of swelling that occurs in the scrotum, usually due to a benign accumulation of fluid. The patient's symptoms of intermittent swelling that is more prominent in the morning and tender but painless swelling in the right scrotum, along with the absence of fever, weight loss, or other symptoms, are consistent with a scrotal cystocele. The patient's age and lack of significant medical history also make this diagnosis more likely.

The other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms.

A. Hydrocele: A hydrocele is a fluid-filled sac that forms around the testicle. While it can cause scrotal swelling, it is usually painless and not tender to the touch, which does not match the patient's symptoms.

B. Intermittent testicular torsion: Testicular torsion occurs when the spermatic cord becomes twisted, cutting off blood flow to the testicle. This can cause sudden and severe pain in the scrotum, but the patient's intermittent swelling and lack of pain do not fit this diagnosis.

C. Primary testicular lymphoma: Testicular lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the testicles. It can cause swelling and pain in the scrotum, but it is relatively rare and typically affects men in their 60s or 70s. The patient's age and lack of other symptoms make this diagnosis less likely.

Therefore, the best answer is D. Scrotal cystocele.

The correct answer is B. Perform cerebral angiography.

The patient's symptoms of worsening blurry vision on the right side, along with the physical examination findings of a right-sided homonymous hemianopia, suggest the possibility of a vascular event affecting the left occipital, temporal, and parietal lobes. The subacute infarction revealed by the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain supports this diagnosis.

Performing cerebral angiography would be the next step in evaluating the extent of the vascular disease and determining the appropriate treatment. Angiography would provide detailed images of the blood vessels in the brain, allowing the clinician to identify any blockages or narrowing of the vessels that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms.

In contrast, beginning treatment with calcium channel blockers for migraine prevention (choice A) may not address the underlying vascular issue causing the patient's symptoms. While calcium channel blockers can be effective in preventing migraines, they are not typically used to treat vascular issues.

Similarly, beginning treatment with tissue plasminogen activator (choice C) may not be appropriate at this stage, as it is typically used to treat acute ischemic stroke, and the patient's symptoms do not suggest an acute event.

Observation (choice D) may not be the best approach, as the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a potentially serious vascular issue that should be further evaluated and treated appropriately.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Perform cerebral angiography.

**Answer**:B. Perform magnetic resonance imaging of the brain

The correct answer is B, Perform magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, because the patient's symptoms and examination results suggest the possibility of a brain tumor or other intracranial lesion affecting the visual pathway. The patient's blurred vision and the presence of a white, elevated lesion in the retina inferior to the optic disc are consistent with a possible tumor or cyst affecting the visual pathway.

Option A, Perform intravenous fluorescein angiography, is not the best next step because it is primarily used to evaluate the retinal vasculature and would not provide information about the brain or visual pathway.

Option C, Follow up in 12 months to reexamine the lesion, is not the best next step because it does not address the patient's current symptoms or provide enough information to determine the cause of the lesion.

Option D, Request fundus examination of the family members, is not relevant to the patient's current condition and would not provide any information about the cause of the lesion.

Therefore, the best next step would be to perform a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to evaluate for any intracranial lesions that may be affecting the visual pathway and causing the patient's symptoms.

**Answer**:C. Search for nematodes under a high-magnification fundus contact lens examination

The correct answer is C. Search for nematodes under a high-magnification fundus contact lens examination. This is because the patient's symptoms of sudden-onset visual loss and central scotoma, along with the physical examination findings of a relative afferent pupillary defect and attenuated ellipsoid zone on OCT, suggest a possible diagnosis of parasitic infection, specifically nematode infestation. The presence of two small glistening lesions in the retina, as seen on fundus photography, further supports this diagnosis.

A high-magnification fundus contact lens examination is the appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis of nematode infestation. This examination allows for a closer look at the retina and can reveal the presence of nematodes or other parasites in the retinal tissue.

The other answer choices are not appropriate for the following reasons:

A. Order indocyanine green angiography: While indocyanine green angiography can be useful in evaluating retinal vasculature and identifying potential vascular abnormalities, it is not the most appropriate next step in this case given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, which suggest a possible parasitic infection.

B. Refer to neurology department: While a neurology consult may be appropriate in some cases of sudden-onset visual loss, it is not the most appropriate next step in this case given the patient's young age, normal neurological examination, and absence of other neurological symptoms.

D. Begin treatment with high-dose corticosteroids: Corticosteroids may be used to treat certain inflammatory eye conditions, but they are not the appropriate next step in this case given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, which suggest a possible parasitic infection. Treating the patient with corticosteroids without further evaluation and diagnosis may mask the underlying condition and potentially lead to inadequate treatment.

**Answer**: D. Perform genetic testing for Leber hereditary optic neuropathy

**Explanation**:
The patient's symptoms of vision loss, cecocentral scotoma, and mild hyperemia of the optic nerves, along with a positive family history of vision loss in a maternal cousin with multiple sclerosis, suggest the possibility of a genetic disorder affecting the optic nerve. Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the optic nerve and can cause vision loss, including cecocentral scotoma. LHON is caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA, specifically in the MT-ND1 gene.

Performing genetic testing for LHON is the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation, as it can confirm the diagnosis and help guide management and counseling for the patient and her family.

The other options are not as appropriate for the following reasons:

A. Checking methylmalonic acid level and repleting vitamin B12 if elevated may be appropriate for patients with suspected methylmalonic acidemia, a rare genetic disorder that can cause vision loss, but it is not relevant to the patient's symptoms or family history.

B. Repeating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be useful in certain cases of vision loss, but it is not likely to provide additional information in this case, as the initial MRI findings were normal.

C. Recommending lumbar puncture may be appropriate for patients with suspected central nervous system disorders, but it is not relevant to the patient's symptoms or family history.

Therefore, option D, Perform genetic testing for Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, is the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation.

Sure, I'd like to explain why choice D is the correct answer and why the other choices are incorrect.

**Answer**: D. Discontinue doxycycline

The patient's symptoms and examination results suggest possible intracranial hypertension (ICH), which can be caused by various factors, including infection, inflammation, and tumors. The patient's history of recent travel to Gabon and exposure to insect bites increases the likelihood of a possible infection.

Doxycycline is an antibiotic that may cause or exacerbate ICH, particularly when given for prolonged periods, as in this case. The patient's use of doxycycline for malaria prophylaxis may have contributed to the development of ICH. Discontinuing doxycycline is appropriate to prevent further increase in ICP.

Now, let's discuss why the other choices are incorrect:

A. Begin amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine: These medications are used to treat fungal infections, which are not indicated in this case. There is no evidence of a fungal infection, and initiating these medications would not address the underlying cause of ICH.

B. Start penicillin intravenously: Penicillin is an antibiotic that may worsen ICH, as it can cause aseptic meningitis or exacerbate existing intracranial pressure. It is not appropriate for this patient's condition.

C. Initiate acetazolamide: Acetazolamide is a medication that can help reduce ICP by decreasing cerebrospinal fluid production. However, it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient, as the underlying cause of ICH needs to be addressed first. Initiating acetazolamide without identifying and treating the underlying cause may not effectively manage the patient's condition.

In summary, discontinuing doxycycline is the most appropriate step in managing this patient's condition, as it may be contributing to the development of ICH. The other choices are not appropriate for this patient's situation and may even worsen their condition.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is D. Genetic testing.

The patient's symptoms, including posterior embryotoxon, corectopia, and cerebellar dysgenesis, suggest a genetic disorder. The family history of no similar abnormalities in other family members suggests that the disorder may be a novel mutation or a rare genetic syndrome. Genetic testing can help identify the specific genetic cause of the patient's condition, which can guide management and counseling for the patient and his family.

Option A, OCT angiography, is not the next step in management. While OCT angiography can provide valuable information about the retinal vasculature, it is not necessary to diagnose the patient's condition. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are already consistent with a diagnosis of posterior embryotoxon, corectopia, and cerebellar dysgenesis.

Option B, topical ocular hypotensive therapy, is also not the next step in management. The patient's elevated intraocular pressures (IOPs) may warrant treatment, but the primary concern is the underlying genetic disorder that is causing the patient's symptoms. Treating the elevated IOPs without addressing the underlying genetic disorder may not effectively manage the patient's condition.

Option C, strabismus surgery, is not the next step in management. The patient's esotropia and hypertelorism may require surgical intervention, but the priority should be to diagnose and manage the underlying genetic disorder. Performing strabismus surgery without addressing the genetic disorder may not effectively improve the patient's visual function or prevent future complications.

Therefore, the next step in management should be D. Genetic testing to identify the specific genetic cause of the patient's condition.

**Answer**:C. Cutaneous blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm

The patient's symptoms and test results point to cutaneous blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm as the correct diagnosis. The patient's skin lesions, which are nonpruritic infiltrative skin lesions on the left upper chest that have spread to the entire chest, back, and right facial areas, are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's medical history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) refractory anemia with excess blasts, type 2 (RAEB-2) or MDS with excess blasts, type 2 (MDS-EB-2) also supports this diagnosis, as cutaneous blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm is a rare complication of MDS.

The immunohistochemical staining results also support this diagnosis. The neoplastic cells are positive for CD4-, CD33-, CD43-, CD56-, CD123-, and TCL1, which are all markers that are commonly expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic cells. The cells are also negative for TdT, MUM1, CD3, CD20, Bcl-6, CyclinD1, and CD8, which are markers that are not typically expressed in plasmacytoid dendritic cells.

The patient's bone marrow biopsy results, which showed normocellular marrow maturing trilineage hematopoiesis with no increase of blasts or other abnormal populations, also support this diagnosis. Cutaneous blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm is a rare complication of MDS, and it is often associated with a poor prognosis.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

**Answer**:C. Defer intervention and continue supportive management

Explanation:

The patient in question is a 44-year-old African American woman without traditional atherosclerotic risk factors or known coronary artery disease (CAD) who presented to the emergency department with chest pain. Her electrocardiogram (ECG) showed anterior ST-segment elevations consistent with an anterior acute current of injury, and her initial troponin I concentration was 0.02 ng/mL but rose to 177.76 ng/mL over the ensuing 4 hours. Urgent coronary angiography was performed, which showed Thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) flow grade 2 in the left anterior descending artery and second diagonal branch.

Given the patient's presentation and angiography results, it is likely that she has an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) caused by a coronary thrombus. The correct management approach would be to defer intervention and continue supportive management, as the patient's chest pain has resolved and her troponin levels have normalized.

Performing PCI to the left anterior descending artery and second diagonal branch with drug-eluting stents (choice A) or bioresorbable vascular scaffolds (choice B) would not be appropriate at this time, as the patient's condition is not severe enough to warrant an invasive procedure. Additionally, the patient's age and lack of traditional atherosclerotic risk factors suggest that she may not be a good candidate for stenting or scaffolding.

Referring for emergency coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (choice D) would also not be appropriate, as the patient's condition is not severe enough to warrant surgical intervention.

Therefore, the best course of action would be to continue supportive management, which may include medications to manage pain, blood pressure, and lipid levels, as well as close monitoring of the patient's condition.

**Answer**: D. Rosai-Dorfman disease

The correct diagnosis is D. Rosai-Dorfman disease. This is a rare benign disorder of histiocytes, characterized by the accumulation of histiocytes in lymph nodes, spleen, or other organs. The patient's symptoms of bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and negative stains for Grocott methenamine silver, acid-fast, and Warthin-Starry, are consistent with Rosai-Dorfman disease. The presence of emperipolesis, which is the engulfment of lymphocytes by histiocytes, on the S-100 and CD-30 immunostains, supports this diagnosis.

Infectious mononucleosis (A) is an unlikely diagnosis, as the patient did not report any associated symptoms such as fever, sore throat, or swollen lymph nodes in the neck or armpits, which are typically seen in mononucleosis. Additionally, the lymph node biopsy findings do not support this diagnosis.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (B) is a rare disorder that can cause cervical lymphadenopathy, but it typically affects children under the age of 10. The patient's age and the absence of skin lesions or other organ involvement make this diagnosis less likely.

Reactive sinus histiocytosis (C) is a rare condition characterized by the proliferation of histiocytes in the sinuses, but it typically does not cause bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and lymph node biopsy findings, the most likely diagnosis is Rosai-Dorfman disease.

The correct answer is B. Discoid lupus erythematosus because it matches the given symptoms and characteristics.

Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a form of cutaneous lupus erythematosus, an autoimmune disease that affects the skin. It is characterized by the formation of scaly, crusted, and red plaques on the skin, often on the face, ears, and scalp. The plaques can be tender and cause discomfort, as described in the case.

The patient's history of a slowly growing erythematous plaque on the left lower eyelid, with occasional discomfort, and the absence of eyelashes, are both consistent with DLE. The physical examination findings, including the erythematous scaling plaque involving the left lower eyelid and its border, and the presence of telangiectatic vessels, whitish structureless areas, and whitish scales on dermoscopy, also support this diagnosis.

The histopathological analysis (hematoxylin-eosin) shown in Figure 1C, which reveals a dense lymphocytic infiltrate, interface dermatitis, and follicular plugging, is also consistent with DLE.

In contrast, the other answer choices do not match the given symptoms and characteristics:

A. Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease that can affect various organs, including the skin. It is characterized by the formation of granulomas, which are absent in DLE.

C. Basal cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that typically appears as a flesh-colored or pink papule or nodule. It does not present with the scaly, crusted, and red plaques characteristic of DLE.

**Answer**: C. Cutaneous sarcoidosis

The correct answer is C. Cutaneous sarcoidosis because it matches the clinical presentation and histopathological findings described in the case.

Cutaneous sarcoidosis is a rare form of sarcoidosis, an inflammatory disease that can affect various organs, including the skin. It is characterized by the presence of non-caseating granulomas, which are clusters of immune cells that form in response to an unknown trigger. In cutaneous sarcoidosis, these granulomas typically appear as papules, nodules, or plaques on the skin, often with a reddish-purple color.

In this case, the patient presented with mildly itchy, erythematous plaques on both legs, with a duration of 3 months. The plaques started as small papules on the left pretibial region and gradually increased in size, coalescing to form larger plaques. The periphery of the plaques showed increased vascularity, with telangiectasias and venous prominences, along with atrophy of the overlying skin. These findings are consistent with cutaneous sarcoidosis.

The skin biopsy showed unremarkable epidermis and multiple epithelioid cell granulomas in the entire dermis, which is also consistent with cutaneous sarcoidosis. The presence of compact, non-caseating, epithelioid cell granulomas with multiple Langhans giant cells supports this diagnosis.

In contrast, the other answer choices do not match the clinical presentation and histopathological findings described in the case:

A. Granulomatous mycosis fungoides: This is a rare form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that is characterized by the presence of granulomas.

**Answer**: B. Cutaneous silica granuloma

The patient's history of asymptomatic, erythematous nodules on his face, neck, and thorax, which increased in size over a period of 6 months, suggests a diagnosis of cutaneous silica granuloma. The patient's history of injuries from an accidental land mine explosion that lacerated his face, neck, and thorax in several places, and the subsequent scars, increases the likelihood of this diagnosis.

Silica granuloma is a type of granuloma that forms in response to the presence of silica in the body. It is a chronic inflammatory response that can occur years after the initial exposure to silica. The patient's history of injuries from the land mine explosion, which likely exposed him to silica, and the subsequent development of erythematous nodules and plaques on his face, neck, and thorax, are consistent with this diagnosis.

The other choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms:

A. Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease that can cause skin lesions, but it is unlikely in this case because the patient does not have any other symptoms consistent with sarcoidosis, such as respiratory or ocular involvement.

C. Infectious granuloma, such as tuberculosis or atypical mycobacterial infection, could also cause skin lesions, but it is unlikely in this case because the patient does not have any signs of infection, such as fever, night sweats, or weight loss.

D. Keloid is a type of raised, thickened scarring that can occur after injury, but it is unlikely in this case because the patient's lesions are not raised or thickened, and they are not located at the site of the original scars.

Therefore, based on the patient's history and physical examination, the most likely diagnosis is cutaneous silica granuloma.

Option A, hepatic artery injury, is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and the absence of any signs of liver injury on the CT scan.

Option B, jejunal injury with intraluminal contrast extravasation, is also unlikely given the patient's symptoms and the fact that the contrast-enhanced CT scan did not show any evidence of intestinal injury.

**Answer**:C. Do plasma electrophoresis and bone marrow analysis

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and test results indicate that he has paraproteinemic maculopathy, a rare condition caused by the deposition of paraproteins in the retina. The patient's history of diabetes and low hemoglobin level suggest that he may have multiple myeloma, a plasma cell dyscrasia that can cause paraproteinemic maculopathy.

Plasma electrophoresis and bone marrow analysis are necessary to confirm the diagnosis of multiple myeloma and to rule out other causes of paraproteinemic maculopathy, such as systemic lupus erythematosus or amyloidosis. These tests can also help determine the severity of the disease and guide treatment decisions.

Treatment with intravitreal dexamethasone implant (Option A) may help reduce inflammation and edema in the short term, but it does not address the underlying cause of the condition. Grid photocoagulation (Option B) is not appropriate for this condition, as it is not a vascular disease.

**Answer**:B. Discontinue cidofovir therapy, and start therapy with topical corticosteroids and cycloplegia

Explanation:

B. Discontinue cidofovir therapy, and start therapy with topical corticosteroids and cycloplegia is the correct answer because it addresses the patient's current symptoms of photophobia and bilateral posterior synechiae, which are indicative of uveitis. Cidofovir is a nucleoside analog that can cause uveitis, and discontinuing it is necessary to prevent further exacerbation of the condition. Topical corticosteroids and cycloplegia can help reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms.

A. Restart cidofovir therapy to treat CMV retinitis is incorrect because there is no evidence of CMV retinitis in the patient's current condition. While the patient has a history of CMV viremia, the fundus examination did not reveal any signs of retinitis. Restarting cidofovir therapy could potentially worsen the patient's uveitis.

C. Administer bilateral subtenon corticosteroid injections is incorrect because subtenon corticosteroid injections are typically used for posterior segment inflammation, and the patient's current symptoms are related to anterior segment inflammation. Topical corticosteroids are a more appropriate treatment for anterior segment inflammation.

D. Begin treatment with oral prednisone is incorrect because oral prednisone is a systemic corticosteroid that can have more side effects than topical corticosteroids, especially for a patient with a history of kidney disease. Topical corticosteroids can effectively treat anterior segment inflammation while minimizing systemic side effects.

Therefore, the best course of action is to discontinue cidofovir therapy and start therapy with topical corticosteroids and cycloplegia to treat the patient's uveitis and alleviate their symptoms.

The correct answer is C. Measure heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure.

The patient presented with subacute bilateral vision loss, which could be related to various causes such as hypertension, diabetes, or retinal detachment. It is important to assess the patient's systemic health, particularly her blood pressure, to rule out any underlying conditions that may be contributing to her symptoms. Measuring heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure can help identify any cardiovascular or respiratory issues that may be impacting her vision.

Option A, Obtain a fluorescein angiogram, may be appropriate later in the evaluation process, but it is not the most immediate step. A fluorescein angiogram is a diagnostic test that uses a special dye to visualize the blood vessels in the retina and can help identify any issues with the retinal circulation. However, it is not the first step in evaluating a patient with subacute vision loss.

Option B, Determine blood glucose level and perform glycated hemoglobin test, may also be relevant in the evaluation of a diabetic patient, but it is not the most pressing concern in this scenario. The patient's history of type 1 diabetes and proliferative diabetic retinopathy suggests that she is likely being managed for her diabetes, and her blood glucose levels and glycated hemoglobin test results may not necessarily provide immediate insight into the cause of her vision loss.

Option D, Perform immediate computed tomography of the head, is not the most appropriate step in this scenario. While a CT scan may be useful in evaluating certain causes of vision loss, such as a tumor or stroke, it is not the most likely cause in this patient's case, given her history of diabetes and retinal disease. Additionally, a CT scan may not provide any information about the patient's retinal circulation or potential issues with her vision.

Therefore, measuring heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure is the most appropriate first step in evaluating this patient's symptoms.

The correct answer is C. Radiotherapy (fractionated external beam radiotherapy)

The patient presents with progressive vision loss, optic nerve atrophy, and bilateral central scotomas, indicating a severe and progressive neuro-ophthalmic disorder. The MRI findings of thickening and nodular enhancement of bilateral perioptic nerve sheaths extending up to the orbital apex, and patchy T2-weighted hyperintensity within the bilateral optic nerves, suggest the possibility of a neuroinflammatory or neoplastic process.

Observation (Option A) is not appropriate given the severity and progressive nature of the patient's symptoms and findings.

Optic nerve sheath biopsy (Option B) may be considered, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management. While it may provide a definitive diagnosis, it is an invasive procedure that carries risks, including visual loss, and may not be necessary given the patient's severe symptoms and MRI findings.

Radiotherapy (Option C) is the most appropriate next step in management. The patient's symptoms and MRI findings suggest a possible diagnosis of bilateral optic neuropathy due to a neuroinflammatory or neoplastic process. Radiotherapy can be effective in treating such conditions, and it is often used as a first-line treatment in cases where there is significant risk of vision loss.

Optic nerve sheath biopsy and radiotherapy (Option D) is not the most appropriate next step. While both options may be considered in the management of the patient, they are not necessarily sequential steps. Radiotherapy is the more urgent intervention given the patient's severe symptoms and MRI findings, and it may be considered prior to biopsy.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Radiotherapy (fractionated external beam radiotherapy).

The correct answer is C. Miliary osteoma cutis because it matches the clinical and histopathological features described in the case.

Miliary osteoma cutis is a rare benign tumor that originates from the hair follicle. It typically presents as small, flesh-colored or white papules on the face, particularly on the cheeks, nose, and forehead. The patient in this case has numerous 1-mm skin-colored grouped monomorphic noninflammatory papules on the bilateral temples, bilateral cheeks, and chin, which is consistent with the characteristic presentation of miliaria osteoma cutis.

The histopathological features also support this diagnosis. The hematoxylin-eosin stain shows a proliferation of small, uniform cells with a slightly basophilic cytoplasm, which is characteristic of miliaria osteoma cutis. The tumor cells are arranged in a pattern of small nests, cords, and trabeculae, which is also consistent with this diagnosis.

In contrast, the other answer choices do not match the clinical and histopathological features described in the case.

Lichen planopilaris (choice A) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by the formation of follicular papules and pustules. It is associated with scarring alopecia and is more common in women. While the patient in this case does have a history of biopsy-proven scalp lichen planopilaris, the facial papules do not have the characteristic features of lichen planopilaris.

Trichoepitheliomas (choice B) are benign tumors that originate from the hair follicle. They typically present as small, flesh-colored or white papules on the face, particularly on the nose, forehead, and cheeks.

**Answer**:B. Metastatic Crohn disease

The patient's symptoms and clinical findings, as described in the case, are consistent with metastatic Crohn disease. The patient has a history of hidradenitis suppurativa, which is a risk factor for developing metastatic Crohn disease. The patient's symptoms of painful intertriginous wounds, ulcers, and edema are consistent with metastatic Crohn disease. The patient's history of multiple admissions for cellulitis and the failure of previous treatments, including surgical excision and split-thickness skin grafting, also support this diagnosis.

The patient's age and medical history of hypertension and depression also increase the likelihood of metastatic Crohn disease. The patient's wound care requirements and the need for a nursing home also suggest a chronic and debilitating condition, which is consistent with metastatic Crohn disease.

The histopathology results shown in Figure C and D, which reveal a chronic inflammatory infiltrate with abundant granulomas, are also consistent with metastatic Crohn disease. The presence of granulomas is a hallmark of Crohn disease and suggests that the patient has a systemic inflammatory response.

In contrast, the other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and clinical findings. Hidradenitis suppurativa (choice A) is a chronic skin condition characterized by recurrent abscesses and nodules, but it does not typically cause widespread ulceration or edema. Pemphigus vegetans (choice C) is an autoimmune blistering disorder that can cause ulcers, but it typically affects the oral mucosa and conjunctiva, and the patient's lips and oropharynx were unremarkable. Linear hypertrophic herpes simplex virus infection (choice D) can cause ulcers, but it typically affects the skin in a linear fashion and does not cause the widespread ulceration and edema described in the case.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, clinical findings, and histopathology results, the most likely diagnosis is metastatic Crohn

**Answer**:B. Multisystem Langerhans cell histiocytosis

The correct answer is B. Multisystem Langerhans cell histiocytosis. The clinical presentation of nonhealing crusted scalp lesions, along with the histopathological findings of a subepidermal infiltrate consisting of large cells with kidney-shaped nuclei, solitary lymphocytes, and eosinophilic granulocytes, and the positive staining for CD1A, are all consistent with the diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH).

LCH is a rare disorder that affects the skin and other organs, and is characterized by the proliferation of Langerhans cells, which are a type of dendritic cell. The condition typically presents with skin lesions, such as papules, nodules, or plaques, and may also involve other organs, such as the bone, lungs, and lymph nodes.

The patient's history of nonhealing crusted scalp lesions, along with the presence of petechial hemorrhages and yellowish crusts, is consistent with the skin manifestations of LCH. The involvement of the scalp is also a common feature of LCH. The patient's age, a 4-year-old boy, is also consistent with the typical age range for LCH, which usually affects children under the age of 10.

The presence of osteolytic lesions on the right frontoparietal skull, as shown on the MRI scan, is also consistent with LCH, as the condition can affect the bone and cause lytic lesions.

The immunohistochemical staining of the infiltrate for CD1A, which is a marker for Langerhans cells, further supports the diagnosis of LCH.

In contrast, the other answer choices do not fit the patient's clinical presentation and histopathological findings.

**Answer**: D. Referral to a behavioral intervention program plus pharmacotherapy with aripiprazole for irritability, agitation, and self-injury

Explanation:

A. Referral of family members for genetic testing to determine 16p11.2 carrier status: While genetic testing may be helpful in understanding the underlying genetic cause of the child's symptoms, it is not the most appropriate next step in management. The child's symptoms, such as tantrums with aggression and self-injury, are severe and need to be addressed immediately.

B. Pharmacotherapy with R-baclofen based on the mouse model of 16p11.2 deletion: While R-baclofen has been shown to improve symptoms in mice with 16p11.2 deletion, there is limited evidence for its effectiveness in humans. Moreover, the child's symptoms are not primarily related to muscle stiffness or spasticity, which is the main target of baclofen.

C. Pharmacotherapy with citalopram for rigidity and repetitive behavior: Citalopram is an antidepressant that has been used to treat repetitive behavior in some neurodevelopmental disorders. However, it has not been shown to be effective in managing self-injurious behavior or aggression, which are the primary concerns in this case.

D. Referral to a behavioral intervention program plus pharmacotherapy with aripiprazole for irritability, agitation, and self-injury: Aripiprazole is an antipsychotic medication that has been shown to reduce irritability and aggression in individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders. In combination with a behavioral intervention program, it may be effective in managing the child's self-injurious behavior and other symptoms. A behavioral intervention program can help the child learn alternative behaviors and coping strategies, and can also provide support and training for the parents and caregivers.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Referral to a behavioral intervention program plus pharmacotherapy with aripiprazole for irritability, agitation

**Answer**: C. Pityriasis rubra pilaris

Pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP) is a chronic skin condition characterized by well-defined, hyperkeratotic desquamation on the extensor surfaces of the limbs, particularly on the feet and hands. The patient's presentation of well-demarcated desquamative patches with scales on both distal feet, showing a sandal appearance, is consistent with PRP.

The patient's history of no local heat, swelling, or discharge from the skin lesions and no known history of atopic dermatitis also supports the diagnosis of PRP. Additionally, the negative fungal smear skin test with potassium hydroxide preparation rules out tinea pedis, which is a common fungal infection of the skin that can cause similar symptoms.

Now, let's discuss why the other answer choices are incorrect:

A. Tinea pedis: As mentioned earlier, tinea pedis is a common fungal infection of the skin that can cause similar symptoms to PRP. However, the patient's history of no local heat, swelling, or discharge from the skin lesions and the negative fungal smear skin test with potassium hydroxide preparation make tinea pedis less likely.

B. Psoriasis: Psoriasis is a chronic skin condition characterized by thick, scaly, red skin plaques. While psoriasis can affect the feet, it typically appears as thick, scaly plaques rather than the well-defined, hyperkeratotic desquamation seen in PRP.

D. Juvenile plantar dermatosis: Juvenile plantar dermatosis is a condition that affects children and is characterized by inflammation and scaling on the soles of the feet. However, it typically presents with more widespread involvement of the soles and heels, rather than the localized, well-demarcated lesions seen in PRP.

Therefore, based on the patient's history and physical examination, the most likely diagnosis is C. Pityriasis rubra pilaris.

**Answer**:B. Testicular cancer

The patient's symptoms and test results indicate several signs that point to testicular cancer. Firstly, the patient had a history of hyperlipidemia, which is a known risk factor for testicular cancer. Secondly, the patient had an unintentional weight loss of 6 months duration, which is a common symptom of testicular cancer. Thirdly, the patient had a palpable mass in the left paraumbilical region, which is a common presentation of testicular cancer. Fourthly, the patient had a missing left testis, which is a common feature of testicular cancer. Fifthly, the elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase and β human chorionic gonadotrophin levels, and the absence of metastasis elsewhere, are all consistent with testicular cancer. Finally, the patient's age, in his 30s, is within the peak age range for testicular cancer incidence.

In contrast, colorectal cancer (choice A) is less likely given the patient's age and the absence of symptoms such as rectal bleeding, abdominal pain, and change in bowel habits. Bladder cancer (choice C) is also less likely given the absence of hematuria and other symptoms associated with bladder cancer. Lymphoma (choice D) is unlikely given the absence of lymphadenopathy and other symptoms associated with lymphoma.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and test results, the most likely diagnosis is testicular cancer.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is C. Rectosigmoid junction rupture.

The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, along with the physical examination findings of paraumbilical ecchymosis, general abdominal tenderness, and distension, suggest a possible intra-abdominal injury. The patient's history of ulcerative colitis and previous appendectomy also increase the likelihood of a gastrointestinal injury.

The abdominal CT scan shows free fluid in the lower quadrants of the abdomen and pneumoperitoneum, which is consistent with a rupture of the rectosigmoid junction. This is supported by the patient's reported abdominal trauma caused by the bicycle handlebar.

Choice A, pancreas injury, is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Although pancreas injury can cause abdominal pain and nausea, it is not typically associated with paraumbilical ecchymosis or distension.

Choice B, flaring ulcerative colitis, is also unlikely given the patient's history of ulcerative colitis and the absence of symptoms such as diarrhea, fever, or rectal bleeding. Additionally, the patient's previous treatment for inflammatory bowel disease had been discontinued.

Choice D, duodenal injury, is less likely given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Duodenal injury may cause abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, but it is not typically associated with paraumbilical ecchymosis or distension.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is C. Rectosigmoid junction rupture.

**Answer**:A. Surgery

The correct answer is A. Surgery. The patient's symptoms of progressive dull pain and decreased visual acuity in the left eye, along with the physical findings of a cataract, vitritis, and a hyperdense foreign body on CT scan, suggest that there is a significant inflammatory process occurring in the eye that requires urgent attention. The presence of a foreign body, likely the result of the corneal scratch, is likely causing ongoing inflammation and could potentially lead to further complications such as endophthalmitis or retinal detachment.

Surgical intervention is necessary to remove the foreign body and alleviate the inflammation. The surgical procedure of choice would likely be a vitrectomy, which involves removing the vitreous gel and the foreign body, and possibly also removing the cataract. This would help to improve the patient's visual acuity and prevent further complications.

Observation (B) is not appropriate as the patient's symptoms and findings suggest a serious inflammatory process that requires immediate attention. Laboratory workup for uveitis (C) may be necessary to determine the underlying cause of the inflammation, but it would not address the immediate need for surgical intervention. Topical and systemic corticosteroid treatment (D) may be used to reduce inflammation, but it would not remove the foreign body or alleviate the underlying cause of the inflammation.

**Answer**:C. Refer the patient to the nephrologist for evaluation of kidney function

Explanation:

A. Monitor the patient: While monitoring the patient is a necessary step in the management of retinal pigment epithelium tears, it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient has a history of kidney transplant and is taking immunosuppressive medications, which may be contributing to the development of retinal pigment epithelium tears. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the patient's kidney function to ensure that the medications are not causing harm to the transplanted kidney.

B. Administer intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor treatment: While intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment may be effective in managing retinal pigment epithelium tears, it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's kidney function needs to be evaluated first to ensure that the medications are not causing harm to the transplanted kidney. Additionally, the patient's retinal pigment epithelium tears may be related to the underlying kidney disease, and treating the retinal tears without addressing the underlying cause may not be effective in the long term.

D. Provide photodynamic therapy with verteporfin: Photodynamic therapy with verteporfin is not appropriate for retinal pigment epithelium tears. While photodynamic therapy can be effective in managing certain retinal conditions, such as age-related macular degeneration, it is not effective for retinal pigment epithelium tears.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to refer the patient to a nephrologist for evaluation of kidney function. This will help to determine whether the patient's medications are causing harm to the transplanted kidney and guide further management of the patient's retinal pigment epithelium tears.

**Answer**:B. Order urgent magnetic resonance imaging of the brain

The patient's symptoms of bilateral progressive painless blurring of vision, metamorphopsia, and acute binocular horizontal diplopia, along with the physical examination findings of bilateral swollen, hyperemic optic discs with multifocal yellowish choroidal lesions, are consistent with a diagnosis of ocular tuberculosis. The patient's history of negative tuberculin skin test, sputum for acid-fast bacilli, and sputum culture, and the absence of any other underlying immunocompromising condition, suggest that the patient may have ocular tuberculosis without pulmonary involvement.

The urgent magnetic resonance imaging of the brain is necessary to evaluate the patient's symptoms of confusion and disorientation, which may indicate involvement of the central nervous system. The MRI will help to identify any intracranial abnormalities, such as tuberculomas or meningitis, that may be causing the patient's symptoms.

Performing a lumbar puncture (choice A) may be necessary later on in the patient's management, but it is not the most appropriate next step. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest that the involvement of the central nervous system is likely, and a lumbar puncture may not provide sufficient information to guide management.

Repeat sputum culture and sensitivity testing (choice C) may be useful in diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis, but it is not the most appropriate next step in the patient's management, given the absence of any respiratory symptoms and the patient's history of negative sputum tests.

Starting broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics (choice D) may be necessary later on in the patient's management, but it is not the most appropriate next step. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest that the infection is likely due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is not effectively treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in the patient's management is to order an urgent magnetic resonance

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is B: Review medical history and systemic medications.

The patient's presentation of progressive bilateral scleral pigmentation, along with peripheral paving-stone degeneration and retinal pigmentary abnormalities, suggests a possible association with a systemic condition. The patient's history of ocular hypertension and narrow angles, as well as the presence of pigmentation in the auricles of both ears, further support the need to investigate potential systemic causes.

Reviewing the patient's medical history and systemic medications (choice B) would help identify any underlying conditions or medications that could be contributing to the patient's symptoms. This is the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation, as it could provide valuable information that would guide further management and treatment decisions.

On the other hand, the other choices are not as relevant to the patient's presentation and potential diagnosis:

A: Ordering a B-scan (choice A) may be appropriate at some point in the patient's evaluation, but it is not the most appropriate next step. A B-scan is an imaging test that can help evaluate the eye's anterior segment, but it would not provide information about potential systemic causes of the patient's symptoms.

C: Discontinuing antiglaucomatous medications (choice C) may be considered if the patient's ocular hypertension is found to be related to a systemic condition, but this would not be the most appropriate next step at this point in the patient's evaluation.

D: Obtaining a 24-hour urine sample (choice D) may be relevant if a systemic condition is suspected, but it is not the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation. A 24-hour urine sample may be more appropriate if the patient's symptoms were consistent with a specific systemic condition, such as a metabolic disorder, but this is not clearly indicated in the patient's presentation.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: Review medical history and systemic medications.

**Answer**:B

The correct answer is B, Perform corneal biopsy, because it is the most appropriate step to diagnose the cause of the central corneal ulcer and hypopyon in a neonate. Corneal biopsy can help to identify the presence of any infectious agents, such as herpes simplex virus, and can also help to rule out other conditions such as fungal or bacterial keratitis.

Option A, Perform another anterior chamber paracentesis procedure and culture, may not provide a definitive diagnosis, as the results of the previous cultures were negative. Additionally, this procedure may not be necessary if the corneal biopsy reveals the underlying cause of the ulcer.

Option C, Inject intravitreal antibiotics, may not be effective in treating a corneal ulcer and may not address the underlying cause of the condition.

Option D, Start prednisolone eyedrops, may not be appropriate at this stage, as it is unclear whether the patient has a steroid-responsive condition. Moreover, steroids may mask the symptoms and signs of an infection, potentially leading to a delay in diagnosis and treatment.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a corneal biopsy to determine the underlying cause of the central corneal ulcer and hypopyon in the patient's right eye.

**Answer**:B. Superficial corneal biopsy

The correct answer is B, Superficial corneal biopsy, because it is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's condition.

The patient presents with bilateral blurry vision one week after starting oral prednisone therapy for a presumed seronegative spondyloarthropathy. On examination, numerous multicolored, highly refractile crystals are seen in the subepithelium and anterior stroma of both corneas. No deposits are noted in the retina of either eye.

Given the patient's symptoms and examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is bilateral corneal deposits due to prednisone therapy. This is a known side effect of long-term oral prednisone use, and it can cause significant visual disturbances.

In this scenario, the next step would be to perform a superficial corneal biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. This is the most appropriate choice because it is a relatively simple and non-invasive procedure that can provide a definitive diagnosis. Additionally, it can help to guide further management and treatment decisions.

The other answer choices are not as appropriate for the following reasons:

A. Initiate topical prednisolone therapy: While topical prednisolone therapy may be considered in the management of corneal deposits, it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient has already been taking oral prednisone, and the deposits have already formed. Topical prednisolone may not be effective in removing the existing deposits, and it may also have systemic side effects.

C. Begin topical fortified vancomycin therapy: Topical fortified vancomycin therapy is not indicated in this case, as there is no evidence of a bacterial infection. Additionally, vancomycin is not effective in removing corneal deposits.

D. Penetrating keratoplasty: This is a surgical procedure that involves replacing the diseased corneal tissue with healthy donor tissue. It is not the most appropriate next step

**Answer**:B. Pulmonary enteric adenocarcinoma (PEA)

The patient's symptoms, imaging findings, and pathology results are consistent with a diagnosis of pulmonary enteric adenocarcinoma (PEA). PEA is a rare type of lung cancer that originates from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and typically affects the peripheral lung tissue.

The patient's age and lack of smoking history are consistent with the demographics of PEA patients. The patient's symptoms, such as a mild, dry cough, are also typical of PEA patients, who often present with non-specific respiratory symptoms.

The imaging findings, including the 10 × 9-cm lobulated left lower lobe mass seen on chest radiograph, are consistent with PEA. PEA tumors typically appear as well-circumscribed masses with irregular margins and may have a lobulated or spiculated border.

The pathology results, including the immunohistochemical profile of CDX2 positive, CK20 positive, TTF-1 negative, and napsin A negative, are also consistent with PEA. CDX2 and CK20 are markers that are commonly expressed in GI tract-derived tumors, while TTF-1 and napsin A are markers that are typically negative in PEA.

The patient's EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 genes being wild type and the absence of PD-1 and PD-L1 expression also support the diagnosis of PEA, as these genetic alterations are less common in PEA compared to other types of lung cancer.

The absence of any evidence of a primary malignant neoplasm in the upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy and colonoscopy, as well as the lack of mediastinal lymphadenopathy or extrathoracic disease on positron emission tomography, also support the diagnosis of PEA, as this tumor type typically originates in the lung rather than metastasizing from another location.

The correct answer is C: Obtain electrocardiogram with right-sided precordial leads.

The patient presents with a history of bronchiectasis, atrial flutter, and now a hip fracture. The electrocardiogram (ECG) shown in the question demonstrates marked right axis deviation with poor R wave progression across the precordial leads V1-V6. This suggests that there may be a problem with the electrical conduction system of the heart, specifically a bundle branch block or hemiblock.

In this case, obtaining an ECG with right-sided precordial leads (C) would be the most appropriate next step. This would help to confirm the presence of a bundle branch block or hemiblock and provide additional information about the electrical conduction system of the heart.

Option A, obtaining a high-sensitivity troponin I level, may be appropriate in the future, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this time. Troponin is a protein that is released into the blood when the heart muscle is damaged, and a high-sensitivity troponin I level can help diagnose myocardial infarction. However, in this case, there are no symptoms or signs of myocardial infarction, and the ECG does not suggest any acute coronary syndrome.

Option B, obtaining a D-dimer level, is not relevant to the patient's current condition. D-dimer is a protein fragment that is produced when a blood clot dissolves, and it can be used to diagnose deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism. However, there are no signs or symptoms of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism in this case.

Option D, obtaining a ventilation/perfusion lung scan, may be appropriate in the future, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this time. A ventilation/perfusion lung scan can help diagnose pulmonary embolism, but it is not necessary at this time given the patient's current symptoms and medical history.

**Answer**:C. Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma

The correct answer is C. Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma because it is a type of cancer that originates in the soft tissues of the body, such as muscles, tendons, and connective tissue. The patient's symptoms, such as a mass in the nasopharynx and skull base, extension into the pterygopalatine fossa, masticator, parapharyngeal, retropharyngeal, and carotid spaces, and involvement of the right posterior orbit, are consistent with a diagnosis of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma.

The patient's age, a woman in her 60s, is also consistent with the age range for which alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma is most commonly diagnosed. Additionally, the fact that the tumor extended into the left superior nasopharynx and superior septum, suggests a more aggressive and invasive tumor, which is consistent with the alveolar subtype of rhabdomyosarcoma.

The immunohistochemical (IHC) staining profile of the tumor, which showed diffuse positivity for desmin, myogenin, and CD56, and focal positivity for low-molecular-weight kininogen (LMWCK), p63, and S-100, is also consistent with a diagnosis of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma.

Esthesioneuroblastoma (choice A) is a type of cancer that originates in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. While it can present with similar symptoms, such as nasal obstruction, headache, and facial swelling, it typically affects younger patients and has a more aggressive clinical course.

Ewing sarcoma (choice B) is a type of cancer that originates in the bones or soft tissues of the body. While it can also present with symptoms such as pain and swelling in the affected area, it typically affects younger patients and has a more aggressive clinical course.

The correct answer is C. Amyloidosis.

Amyloidosis is a condition where abnormal proteins called amyloid fibrils accumulate in organs and tissues, leading to damage and dysfunction. One of the most common forms of amyloidosis is primary amyloidosis, which is caused by the production of abnormal immunoglobulin light chains. This condition can affect various organs, including the larynx, and cause symptoms such as hoarseness, coughing, and difficulty swallowing.

The patient in the case presented with symptoms of oropharyngeal and supraglottic airway narrowing, which is a common symptom of laryngeal amyloidosis. The presence of a submucosal soft-tissue mass containing punctate calcifications centered on the epiglottis, as shown in the CT image, is also consistent with laryngeal amyloidosis. Additionally, the patient's laboratory results showed elevated levels of serum-free λ light chain and proteinuria, which are common findings in primary amyloidosis.

The other answer choices are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and laboratory results. Squamous cell carcinoma (choice A) is a type of cancer that can affect the larynx, but it would not cause the same symptoms as amyloidosis. Lymphoma (choice B) is a type of cancer that can affect the larynx, but it would not cause the same laboratory results as amyloidosis. Rhabdomyosarcoma (choice D) is a type of cancer that can affect the larynx, but it is rare and would not cause the same symptoms and laboratory results as amyloidosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Amyloidosis.

**Answer**: C. Sigmoid sinus diverticulum

The correct answer is C. Sigmoid sinus diverticulum because it matches the symptoms and findings described in the case.

A sigmoid sinus diverticulum is a rare condition where a sac-like structure forms in the sigmoid sinus, which is a venous structure in the temporal bone. This condition can cause pulsatile tinnitus, which is a whooshing or pulsing sound in the ear, due to the abnormal blood flow through the diverticulum.

The patient's symptoms of constant pulsatile tinnitus with a whooshing quality, which is exacerbated by holding her breath and turning her head to the left, and relieved by compression of her right neck and turning her head to the right, are consistent with a sigmoid sinus diverticulum. The fact that the bruit (an abnormal sound heard through a stethoscope) was heard in the right ear and could be stopped with gentle compression of the right side of the neck also supports this diagnosis.

The imaging findings shown in Figure 1, which reveal a large, irregularly-shaped mass in the right temporal bone, are also consistent with a sigmoid sinus diverticulum. The arrowheads in the image point to the diverticulum, which is located in the sigmoid sinus.

The other answer choices do not match the symptoms and findings described in the case:

A. Carotid cochlear dehiscence: This is a condition where the bone covering the carotid artery in the temporal bone is defective, leading to a risk of stroke. It can cause pulsatile tinnitus, but the symptoms and imaging findings do not support this diagnosis.

B. Semicircular canal dehiscence: This is a condition where the bone covering the semicircular canal in the temporal bone is defective, leading to balance problems and hearing loss. It can cause pulsatile tinnitus, but the patient's symptoms and imaging findings do not support this diagnosis.

**Answer**: D. Perineural spread of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma

The patient's symptoms of "electric" and "stabbing" pain in the right-sided lateral neck, along with the physical examination findings of a mass running along the lateral border of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle, and the MRI results of an enhancing tubular structure along the lateral surface of the right SCM muscle, are all consistent with perineural spread of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.

Perineural spread is a common pattern of spread for cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, where the cancer cells infiltrate along the nerve sheaths, including the facial nerve. The location of the mass along the lateral border of the SCM muscle, which is near the course of the facial nerve, supports this diagnosis.

The patient's history of a right ear skin cancer excised by a dermatologist also increases the likelihood of this diagnosis, as cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma can spread to lymph nodes and along nerves. The absence of numbness or other symptoms in the right ear or cheek also suggests that the cancer has not yet caused significant nerve damage.

The other choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and findings.

A. Primary nerve sheath tumor: This is an uncommon tumor that arises from the supporting cells of the nerve, and is usually slow-growing and benign. The patient's symptoms and MRI findings do not suggest a primary nerve sheath tumor.

B. Thrombophlebitis of external jugular vein: Thrombophlebitis is an inflammation of a vein, usually caused by a blood clot. The patient's symptoms and MRI findings do not suggest thrombophlebitis, as there is no evidence of a blood clot or inflammation in the vein.

**Answer**:C. Prescribe a topical corticosteroid and a topical antimicrobial

The correct answer is C. Prescribe a topical corticosteroid and a topical antimicrobial, as it is the most appropriate treatment for the patient's condition.

A. Prescribe topical ketoconazole:
Ketoconazole is an antifungal medication that is commonly used to treat fungal infections of the skin, such as ringworm. However, it is not the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition, as the biopsy results showed epidermal acantholysis, which is not a fungal infection. Therefore, choice A is incorrect.

B. Obtain glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) level:
HbA1C is a blood test that measures the average glucose level in the body over the past 2-3 months. It is used to diagnose and monitor diabetes mellitus. While the patient's sister has diabetes mellitus, there is no indication in the patient's history or physical examination to suggest that he has diabetes. Therefore, choice B is not relevant to the patient's condition and is incorrect.

D. Consult for surgical excision:
Surgical excision may be necessary for some skin conditions, such as skin cancers or large benign growths. However, it is not the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition, as the rash is widespread and not localized to a specific area that can be easily excised. Additionally, surgical excision may not address the underlying cause of the rash. Therefore, choice D is not the most appropriate treatment option and is incorrect.

In contrast, a topical corticosteroid and a topical antimicrobial are appropriate treatments for this patient's condition. The corticosteroid will help to reduce inflammation and itching, while the antimicrobial will help to treat any underlying bacterial infection that may be contributing to the rash. Therefore, choice C is the correct answer.

The correct answer is D. Halo scalp ring (pressure necrosis). This is because the description of the baby's scalp lesion, which is characterized by a deep, 8x1-cm trenchlike ulcer with no drainage, is consistent with a halo scalp ring. Halo scalp ring is a condition that occurs when there is pressure necrosis of the skin and subcutaneous tissue, usually as a result of prolonged pressure on the scalp, such as from a prolonged second stage of labor or from being in a birth canal for an extended period. The ulcer described in the case is consistent with this condition, and the absence of drainage suggests that it is not an abscess or cellulitis.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Aplasia cutis congenita: This is a congenital condition characterized by a failure of skin development, resulting in a absence of skin over a specific area of the body. While it can occur on the scalp, it is not consistent with the description of a deep, trenchlike ulcer.

B. Cellulitis and abscess associated with neonatal group B streptococcal infection: While cellulitis and abscess can occur in neonates, the description of the ulcer does not suggest an infection. The absence of drainage and the lack of signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, or warmth, also argue against this diagnosis.

C. Epidermolysis bullosa: This is a genetic disorder characterized by fragile skin and mucous membranes, leading to blistering and skin erosion. While it can occur on the scalp, it is not consistent with the description of a deep, trenchlike ulcer.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Halo scalp ring (pressure necrosis).

**Answer**:B. Pancreatic panniculitis

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and history are consistent with pancreatic panniculitis, a rare condition characterized by inflammation of the subcutaneous fat caused by the release of pancreatic enzymes into the bloodstream. The patient's history of pancreatitis and panhypopituitarism increases the likelihood of this diagnosis. The patient's tender nodules on the lower legs, bilateral lower extremity edema, and background of pinpoint folliculocentric papules on the legs and thighs consistent with keratosis pilaris, are all consistent with pancreatic panniculitis.

Erythema nodosum (choice A) is a possible diagnosis, but it typically presents with more widespread and painful nodules, and a more prominent inflammatory response. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency panniculitis (choice C) is a rare condition that can present with similar symptoms, but it typically affects the upper extremities and trunk, and is associated with a deficiency of alpha-1-antitrypsin, which is not mentioned in the patient's history. Polyarteritis nodosa (choice D) is a systemic vasculitis that can affect the skin, but it typically presents with more widespread skin lesions, and the patient's history and physical examination do not suggest this diagnosis.

**Answer**:B. Folliculocentric lichen sclerosus et atrophicus

The correct answer is B, Folliculocentric lichen sclerosus et atrophicus, for the following reasons:

A. Lichen amyloidosis: This is an incorrect choice because lichen amyloidosis typically presents with violaceous, polygonal papules or nodules, whereas the patient in the case presented with hypopigmented, atrophic, and folliculocentric papules. Additionally, lichen amyloidosis does not typically involve the trunk, and the histopathology does not show the characteristic amyloid deposits.

C. Guttate vitiligo: This is an incorrect choice because guttate vitiligo typically presents with small, depigmented macules or papules on the trunk and extremities, whereas the patient in the case presented with larger, hypopigmented, atrophic, and folliculocentric papules. Additionally, the histopathology does not show the characteristic loss of melanocytes and pigmentation in the skin.

D. Eruptive tumors of the follicular infundibulum: This is an incorrect choice because eruptive tumors of the follicular infundibulum typically present with multiple, small, flesh-colored or pink papules on the trunk and extremities, whereas the patient in the case presented with larger, hypopigmented, atrophic, and folliculocentric papules. Additionally, the histopathology does not show the characteristic features of tumors.

Therefore, the correct answer is B, Folliculocentric lichen sclerosus et atrophicus, as it best fits the patient's symptoms and histopathology results.

**Answer**: B. Branchio-oto-renal syndrome

Branchio-oto-renal syndrome (BOR) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of the branchial apparatus, the inner ear, and the kidneys. The hallmark of BOR is the presence of a lateral neck mass that drains clear fluid, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms. The additional findings of a preauricular sinus and ear pit, as well as the patient's history of failed hearing tests and small kidneys, also support this diagnosis.

Alport syndrome (choice A) is a genetic disorder that affects the kidneys, eyes, and inner ear. It is characterized by progressive sensorineural hearing loss, vision loss, and kidney damage. While the patient's history of failed hearing tests and small kidneys may be consistent with Alport syndrome, the presence of a lateral neck mass that drains clear fluid is not a typical feature of this disorder.

Goldenhar syndrome (choice C) is a genetic disorder that affects the development of the face, ears, and vertebrae. It is characterized by a variety of facial and ear abnormalities, as well as spinal and other skeletal defects. While the patient's preauricular sinus and ear pit may be consistent with Goldenhar syndrome, the presence of a lateral neck mass that drains clear fluid is not a typical feature of this disorder.

Papillorenal syndrome (choice D) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of the kidneys and the inner ear. It is characterized by the presence of a renal tumor that secretes a hormone that stimulates the production of earwax. While the patient's history of small kidneys may be consistent with Papillorenal syndrome, the presence of a lateral neck mass that drains clear fluid is not a typical feature of this disorder.

In summary, Branchio-oto-renal syndrome is the most likely diagnosis for this patient based on the combination of a lateral neck mass that drains clear fluid, a preauricular sinus, an ear pit, failed hearing

**Answer**: B. Hemorrhagic shock secondary to perforated hemorrhagic calculous cholecystitis

The correct answer is B because the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with hemorrhagic shock due to a perforated hemorrhagic calculous cholecystitis. The patient's history of severe abdominal pain, hypotension, and low hematocrit level are all consistent with significant blood loss. The elevated creatinine level and lactate level suggest that the patient is in a state of shock. The patient's history of taking warfarin for deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism also increases the likelihood of bleeding.

The computed tomography angiogram showed gallstones in the neck of the gallbladder, high-density material within the lumen, and free intraperitoneal fluid, which are all consistent with a perforated hemorrhagic calculous cholecystitis. The blush of contrast within the lumen of the gallbladder and surrounding hyperemia of the liver at the gallbladder fossa on the contrast-enhanced CT scan also support this diagnosis.

In contrast, the other answer choices do not fit the patient's symptoms and laboratory results as well.

A. Anaphylactic shock secondary to ruptured echinococcal cyst: This diagnosis does not fit the patient's symptoms or laboratory results. While anaphylactic shock can cause hypotension and abdominal pain, it is not associated with a history of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, and it does not explain the elevated creatinine level or lactate level.

C. Hemorrhagic shock secondary to spontaneous intra-abdominal hemorrhage: This diagnosis is possible, but it is less likely than perforated hemorrhagic calculous cholecystitis given the patient's history of taking warfarin and the findings on the CT scan.

D. Septic shock secondary to perforated cholecystitis: This diagnosis is possible, but it is less likely

**Answer**: B. Coronary steal syndrome

The output is B. Coronary steal syndrome. Let's break down why this is the correct answer and why the other choices are incorrect.

B. Coronary steal syndrome:
Coronary steal syndrome, also known as coronary steal phenomenon, occurs when a significant difference in blood pressure between the left and right arms leads to a redistribution of blood flow through the coronary arteries. This can cause ischemia in the myocardial tissue, leading to symptoms such as angina, dyspnea, and fatigue.

In this case, the patient has a history of coronary artery bypass grafting using the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to the left anterior descending (LAD) in 1997. The patient's symptoms of frequent ventricular tachycardia, dyspnea on exertion, and left leg claudication at 23 m, as well as the physical examination finding of a diminished left radial pulse, are consistent with coronary steal syndrome. The patient's history of previous coronary artery disease and the difference in blood pressure between the left and right arms (146/65 mm Hg vs. 85/50 mm Hg) further support this diagnosis.

A. Normal coronary angiography:
This choice is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest the presence of coronary artery disease, which is confirmed by the coronary angiography shown in the figure.

C. Subclavian steal syndrome:
Subclavian steal syndrome is a condition that occurs when there is a significant difference in blood pressure between the left and right arms, leading to a redistribution of blood flow through the subclavian artery. This can cause ischemia in the arm and hand, leading to symptoms such as pain, numbness, and weakness. While the patient does have a history of previous coronary artery disease, the symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest subclavian steal syndrome.

**Answer**:C. Refer for serial plasmapheresis

The patient's symptoms of progressive dimming vision, unintentional weight loss, fevers, and subacute visual decline, along with the physical examination findings of mild anterior and posterior inflammation, raise suspicion for panuveitis. The negative results of laboratory tests for sarcoidosis, Lyme disease, and syphilis suggest that the cause of the panuveitis is unlikely to be infectious in nature. The presence of a right upper lobe lung mass on chest radiograph, which was diagnosed as T2N2M0 stage III non–small-cell lung cancer on biopsy, suggests that the panuveitis is likely to be related to the patient's lung cancer.

The patient's visual acuity of 20/150 OD and 20/200 OS, which improved to 20/70 OU with pinhole, suggests that there is significant visual impairment due to the panuveitis. The bilateral diffuse retinal pigment epithelial alterations with a prominent leopard spot pattern, focal choroidal pigmented lesions, and subretinal fluid tracked to the inferior periphery in both eyes, as seen on Optos photograph and optical coherence tomography, support the diagnosis of panuveitis. The nummular hypoautofluorescent lesions interspersed within areas of hyperautofluorescence on autofluorescence imaging and the optic disc and peripheral vasculature leaking on fluorescein angiography suggest that the panuveitis is likely to be associated with choroidal neovascularization.

Given the patient's history of lung cancer and the presence of choroidal neovascularization, the most appropriate next step would be to refer the patient for serial plasmapheresis. Plasmapheresis is a process that removes antibodies from the blood, which can help to reduce inflammation and prevent further vision loss. It is commonly used in the treatment of certain eye diseases, such as uveitis and choroidal neovascularization, especially when associated with cancer.

**Answer**: C. Perform excisional biopsy

The correct answer is C. Perform excisional biopsy because it is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's bulbar conjunctival nodule.

The patient has a history of rheumatoid arthritis and is taking oral methotrexate, which may suppress the immune system and increase the risk of infections. The patient has also been treated with topical antibiotics and oral sulindac without improvement, suggesting that the lesion may not be responsive to antibiotic therapy alone.

Excisional biopsy would allow for a definitive diagnosis of the lesion, which is essential for appropriate management. The patient's symptoms of a foreign body sensation and the lesion's purulent appearance suggest that it may be an inflammatory or infectious process, but the negative cultures for herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus polymerase chain reactions make it less likely that the lesion is caused by a viral infection.

Option A, initiating oral colchicine therapy, may be appropriate for some inflammatory eye conditions, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a more localized process that may require surgical intervention.

Option B, observing with serial examinations, may be appropriate for some cases of conjunctival lesions, but in this case, the patient has already been treated with antibiotics and the lesion has not improved. Furthermore, the patient's symptoms and the lesion's purulent appearance suggest that a more active approach is warranted.

Option D, performing intralesional dexamethasone injection, may be appropriate for some inflammatory eye conditions, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a more localized process that may require surgical intervention.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to perform an excisional biopsy to establish a definitive diagnosis and guide further management.

**Answer**:A. Observe or perform laser photocoagulation to areas of peripheral retinal nonperfusion

Explanation:
The correct answer is A, "Observe or perform laser photocoagulation to areas of peripheral retinal nonperfusion," because it is the most appropriate management option for the patient's current condition.

The patient has persistent peripheral retinal avascularity and arteriovenous anastomoses after intravitreal bevacizumab therapy for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). These findings suggest that the patient has areas of nonperfusion in the peripheral retina, which may be contributing to the persistent avascularity.

Laser photocoagulation is a well-established treatment for retinal nonperfusion, and it can help to improve retinal blood flow and reduce the risk of further complications. In this case, observing the patient with regular follow-up and performing laser photocoagulation to areas of peripheral retinal nonperfusion as needed is a reasonable approach.

Option B, "Administer intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor therapy again," may not be necessary at this time, as the patient does not have evidence of recurrent ROP or retinal neovascularization. Repeat intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy may be considered in the future if there is evidence of disease progression or recurrence.

Option C, "Administer combined intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor therapy and laser photocoagulation to areas of nonperfusion," may be a reasonable approach in some cases, but it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient. The patient does not have evidence of recurrent ROP or retinal neovascularization, and the primary goal of treatment at this time is to address the persistent peripheral retinal avascularity.

Option D, "Perform pars plana vitrectomy," is not a appropriate management option for this patient. Vitrectomy is a surgical procedure that is typically reserved for more advanced stages of ROP or other retinal diseases, and it is not indicated for persistent peripheral retinal avascularity without

The correct answer is C. Observe.

The patient presents with recurrent, transient vision loss in the right eye, which is always preceded by using an electronic reader tablet in dim lighting while lying on her left side. The patient's symptoms are consistent with monocular vision loss, which can be caused by various factors such as retinal detachment, vitreomacular traction, or ocular migraine. However, the presence of an enhancing orbital mass on MRI suggests that the cause of the vision loss may be related to the mass.

Given the patient's history and examination findings, it is important to consider the possibility of a vascular etiology for the vision loss, such as a carotid artery dissection or a posterior cerebral artery stroke. However, the absence of any other neurological symptoms, such as headache, visual aura, or dizziness, makes a vascular etiology less likely.

Option A, performing an echocardiogram and Holter monitoring, may be appropriate if the patient had a history of cardiac disease or risk factors, but it is not directly related to the patient's current symptoms.

Option B, biopsying the orbital mass, may be appropriate if the mass was growing or changing in size, but given that the mass has been stable for 3 months, a biopsy may not be necessary at this time.

Option D, performing a hypercoagulability workup, may be appropriate if the patient had a history of thrombophilia or other risk factors for blood clots, but it is not directly related to the patient's current symptoms.

Therefore, the best course of action would be to observe the patient and monitor her symptoms, as well as perform regular follow-up examinations to assess for any changes in the orbital mass or vision loss. This approach allows for close monitoring of the patient's condition without exposing her to unnecessary risks or procedures.

In summary, option C, Observe, is the correct answer because it allows for close monitoring of the patient's condition without exposing her to unnecessary risks or procedures, while also considering the possibility of a vascular etiology for the vision loss.

**Answer**: D. Orbital biopsy

The case presented is a 1-year-old boy with a history of restricted movements of the left eye since birth, diagnosed as having an orbital capillary hemangioma. The patient had inferior displacement of the left globe with a severe limitation of supraduction and a mild limitation of horizontal movement in the left eye, and was unable to maintain fixation with the left eye. The results of modified Krimsky testing showed 6 prism diopters (PD) of exotropia and 16 PD of left hypotropia. Retinoscopy disclosed a cycloplegic refraction of +2.00 diopters (D) in the right eye and +6.00 D in the left eye. Repeated MRI with coronal images showed massive enlargement of the superior, inferior, and medial rectus muscles, with an isointense curvilinear signal in the intraconal fat.

Given the patient's history and the results of the physical examination and imaging studies, the most appropriate next step would be to perform an orbital biopsy. This is because the patient has a mass in the orbit that is affecting the movement of the eye and the biopsy will help to determine the nature of the mass and guide further management.

Option A, investigating for systemic involvement, may be appropriate in some cases of orbital masses, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as the patient's symptoms and signs are primarily related to the left eye and there is no evidence of systemic involvement.

Option B, genetic testing for congenital fibrosis of extraocular muscles, may also be appropriate in some cases, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as the patient's symptoms and signs are not consistent with this condition and there is no family history to suggest this diagnosis.

Option C, strabismus surgery, may be necessary in the future, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this time, as the patient's eye movement limitations are caused by the orbital mass and need to be addressed before considering surgery.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Orbital biopsy.

**Answer**: C. Perform intraocular lens explantation, capsulectomy, and intravitreal vancomycin injection

The patient in this case has chronic inflammation after YAG capsulotomy, with persistent anterior chamber cells, hypopyon, and cystoid macular edema despite previous treatments with antibiotics and steroids. The recent recurrence of pain, redness, and decreased visual acuity suggests that the inflammation is still active.

Option A, prescribing topical moxifloxacin and consulting an infectious diseases specialist, may be appropriate for a bacterial infection, but it does not address the underlying cause of the inflammation. The patient has already received intravitreal antibiotics, and the cultures yielded no growth, suggesting that the inflammation may not be due to an active bacterial infection.

Option B, performing another vitreous tap and intravitreal vancomycin injection, may provide temporary relief of the inflammation, but it does not address the underlying cause of the inflammation. Repeating the same treatment without addressing the root cause may not lead to a successful outcome.

Option D, injecting intravitreal vancomycin and administering systemic vancomycin and prednisone, may be appropriate for an active bacterial infection, but it is not indicated in this case, as the cultures yielded no growth, and the patient has already received intravitreal antibiotics. Moreover, systemic steroids may not be appropriate for a chronic inflammation that is not due to an active infection.

Option C, performing intraocular lens explantation, capsulectomy, and intravitreal vancomycin injection, is the most appropriate choice. The patient's persistent inflammation and cystoid macular edema suggest that the inflammation may be related to the YAG capsulotomy, and removing the intraocular lens and capsule may help to resolve the inflammation. Intravitreal vancomycin injection can provide additional antibiotic coverage to prevent any potential infection. This approach addresses the

**Answer**: C. Mycosis fungoides

Mycosis fungoides (MF) is a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that typically presents with patches or plaques on the skin, which can progress to tumors and nodules over time. The patient's symptoms of gradually worsening pruritic plaques on the scalp, face, neck, chest, abdomen, arms, and thighs, as well as the development of nodules on the nose and cheeks, are consistent with MF. The patient's history of taking valproic acid and phenytoin, which are known to cause exfoliative dermatitis, suggests that the patient may have developed MF as a result of drug-induced lymphoproliferation.

The patient's skin lesions slightly improving after switching medications and tapering steroids, followed by the development of diffuse urticarial lesions of varying sizes over the old plaques, are also consistent with MF. The patient's condition worsening over a 6-month period, with the plaques and nodules becoming more numerous and increasing in thickness, especially on the face, and the development of early leonine facies, are also consistent with MF.

The negative T cell receptor γ gene (TRG) rearrangement analysis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the dense band-like lymphoid infiltrate in the superficial dermis with mild epidermotropism seen in the second biopsy specimen, are also consistent with MF. The third biopsy specimen result being consistent with the suspected diagnosis of MF further supports this diagnosis.

Lymphomatoid papulosis (A) is a rare condition characterized by the development of papules or nodules on the skin, which can resolve spontaneously or persist for years. It is not typically associated with drug-induced lymphoproliferation, and the patient's symptoms and history do not support this diagnosis.

**Answer**: A

The patient's symptoms of recurrent dyspnea and palpitations, along with the physical examination findings of sinus tachycardia and the electrocardiogram (ECG) showing sinus rhythm and early repolarization changes, suggest a cardiac condition. The transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) shows a normal left ventricular ejection fraction and estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure, which rules out left-sided heart failure. The patient's age and absence of any other comorbidities also suggest that the condition is unlikely to be caused by coronary artery disease.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is cor triatriatum, which is a rare congenital cardiac condition characterized by a membrane that divides the left atrium into two compartments, resulting in a decrease in cardiac output. This condition can cause symptoms such as dyspnea, palpitations, and fatigue, especially during physical activity.

The other options are not appropriate for the patient's symptoms and examination findings.

Option B, perform transcatheter balloon mitral valvuloplasty, is not appropriate because the patient does not have mitral valve stenosis or any other valvular heart disease.

Option C, perform surgical mitral valve repair and annuloplasty, is also not appropriate for the same reason.

Option D, perform surgical left atriotomy and membrane resection, may be a possible treatment option for cor triatriatum, but it is not the next step in management. The patient needs to be managed medically first, and repeated TTE in 6 months is necessary to monitor the progression of the disease and assess the effectiveness of medical management before considering surgical intervention.

Therefore, the correct answer is A, manage the patient medically and perform repeated transthoracic echocardiography in 6 months.

The correct answer is B. Salivary gland anlage tumor because it best fits the patient's symptoms and the described characteristics of the nasopharyngeal mass.

A. Dermoid: A dermoid is a benign growth that originates from ectodermal cells and typically presents as a skin-covered mass. While it's possible for a dermoid to occur in the nasopharynx, the patient's symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing, gasping, and apneic episodes at night, as well as the described firm, mobile mass in the nasopharynx, are not typical for a dermoid. Additionally, the pathologic description of keratinizing squamous cysts and collections of ductal structures set within a myxoid stroma does not support a diagnosis of dermoid.

C. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignant tumor that arises from the epithelial cells of the nasopharynx. NPC typically presents with symptoms such as nasal obstruction, bleeding, and facial pain. The patient's symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing and gasping episodes at night are not typical for NPC. Additionally, the pathologic description of keratinizing squamous cysts and collections of ductal structures set within a myxoid stroma does not support a diagnosis of NPC.

D. Hemangioma: Hemangioma is a benign vascular tumor that can occur in various parts of the body, including the nasopharynx.

**Answer**: B. Sialolith

A. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma:
Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a type of cancer that affects the salivary glands. It is a malignant tumor that can arise in the mouth, nasal cavity, or throat. The symptoms of mucoepidermoid carcinoma can include a painless lump or swelling in the mouth, face, or neck, difficulty swallowing, and facial weakness or paralysis. However, in this case, the patient presented with a hard swelling of the left inner cheek, which is not consistent with the symptoms of mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Additionally, the lesion described in the case is only 15 × 10 mm, which is relatively small compared to the typical size of a mucoepidermoid carcinoma tumor. Therefore, choice A is incorrect.

B. Sialolith:
A sialolith is a stone that forms in the salivary gland, typically in the submandibular gland. It can cause pain and swelling in the mouth, face, or neck, especially when eating or drinking. The symptoms of a sialolith can include a hard, painful lump in the mouth, difficulty swallowing, and increased salivation. The lesion described in the case, which is hard and produces a small amount of bleeding with palpation, is consistent with a sialolith. Additionally, the location of the lesion, adjacent to the maxillary first molar, is consistent with the typical location of a sialolith in the submandibular gland. Therefore, choice B is correct.

The correct answer is C. Hypoglossal nerve schwannoma because the patient's symptoms and the results of the imaging studies and biopsy are consistent with this diagnosis.

A. Submandibular gland pleomorphic adenoma is an incorrect choice because although this type of benign tumor can occur in the submandibular gland, it typically presents with a slow-growing mass in the neck, and the patient's symptoms of pain and firmness in the submandibular area for 2 years are not consistent with the typical presentation of pleomorphic adenoma. Additionally, the histopathologic findings of a spindle cell neoplasm with no malignant features are not consistent with pleomorphic adenoma.

B. Chronic lymphadenitis is an incorrect choice because the patient's symptoms of pain and firmness in the submandibular area for 2 years are not consistent with the typical presentation of chronic lymphadenitis, which is usually associated with swelling and tenderness of the lymph nodes. Additionally, the imaging studies did not show any evidence of lymphadenitis.

D. Chronic submandibular sialadenitis is an incorrect choice because the patient's symptoms of pain and firmness in the submandibular area for 2 years are not consistent with the typical presentation of chronic submandibular sialadenitis, which is usually associated with pain and swelling of the submandibular gland. Additionally, the histopathologic findings of a spindle cell neoplasm with no malignant features are not consistent with chronic submandibular sialadenitis.

C. Hypoglossal nerve schwannoma is the correct choice because the patient's symptoms of pain and firmness in the submandibular area for 2 years, along with the imaging studies and biopsy results, are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's history of bruxism and long-term use of a bite guard may have contributed to the development of the schwannoma. The histopathologic findings of a spindle

**Answer**: C. Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma

The correct answer is C. Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma because it best fits the clinical and pathological features described in the case.

A. Metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma is an unlikely diagnosis because the patient does not have a history of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and the clinical and pathological features do not suggest a metastatic lesion from a nasopharyngeal primary tumor.

B. Melanoma is also an unlikely diagnosis because the patient does not have a history of melanoma, and the clinical and pathological features do not suggest a melanocytic lesion. The presence of a dense lymphocytic infiltrate and the negative immunohistochemical staining for melanocytic markers (such as S-100 and HMB-45) further support this diagnosis.

D. Cutaneous lymphadenoma is a rare diagnosis that typically presents as a small, nodular lesion on the skin. The clinical and pathological features described in the case do not suggest a cutaneous lymphadenoma.

C. Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma is a rare type of cutaneous carcinoma that is characterized by a dense lymphocytic infiltrate and a lack of keratinization. The clinical and pathological features described in the case, including the patient's age, the location of the lesion, the progressive growth over time, and the negative immunohistochemical staining for keratin markers (such as CK903 and EMA), are consistent with a diagnosis of lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma. The positive immunohistochemical staining for p16 and the lack of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) in situ hybridization also support this diagnosis.

Therefore, based on the clinical and pathological features described in the case, the most likely diagnosis is C. Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma.

The correct answer is D. Replace esomeprazole with nortriptyline.

Esomeprazole, a proton pump inhibitor, is a medication commonly used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, in this case, the patient's symptoms did not improve despite taking esomeprazole, and she was referred for esophageal physiologic testing. The test results showed that the patient had abnormal reflux, indicating that she may have GERD.

However, it's important to note that GERD is not the only cause of postprandial retrosternal burning. Other conditions, such as gastrointestinal motility disorders, can also cause similar symptoms. Therefore, it's important to consider other treatment options beyond acid suppression therapy.

Nortriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, is an alternative medication that can be used to treat gastrointestinal motility disorders. It works by increasing the activity of the lower esophageal sphincter and improving gastric emptying. In this case, replacing esomeprazole with nortriptyline may be a better option for the patient, as it addresses the possible underlying cause of her symptoms, which is not necessarily acid reflux.

Now, let's discuss why the other answer choices are incorrect:

A. Increase esomeprazole to 40 mg twice daily: This option is incorrect because, as mentioned earlier, the patient's symptoms did not improve despite taking esomeprazole, and increasing the dose may not address the underlying cause of her symptoms.

B. Perform a barium esophagogram: This option is incorrect because a barium esophagogram is a diagnostic test that is used to evaluate the anatomy of the esophagus and detect any abnormalities, such as strictures or ulcers. While it may be useful in some cases, it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's management, as the patient has already undergone esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and esophageal physiologic testing.

**Answer**:B. Obtain a biopsy of the nodule

The correct answer is B, Obtain a biopsy of the nodule, because it is the most appropriate step to determine the nature of the nodule and provide a diagnosis. The patient's history of ovarian cancer and recent treatment with chemotherapy, as well as the appearance and behavior of the nodule, suggest that it may be related to the cancer. A biopsy would allow for a tissue sample to be examined under a microscope to determine if it is cancerous or not.

A, Swab and send for cultures, may be appropriate if there was a concern about infection, but it is not the most appropriate step in this case given the patient's history and the appearance of the nodule.

C, Consult wound care for barrier protection, may be appropriate if the nodule was caused by a wound or skin breakdown, but it is not the most appropriate step in this case given the patient's history of cancer and the appearance of the nodule.

D, Prescribe topical steroids, may be appropriate if the nodule was caused by an allergic or inflammatory reaction, but it is not the most appropriate step in this case given the patient's history of cancer and the appearance of the nodule.

Therefore, B, Obtain a biopsy of the nodule, is the most appropriate answer.

**Answer**: C. Annular lichenoid dermatitis of youth

The correct answer is C. Annular lichenoid dermatitis of youth, as it best matches the clinical and histopathological features described in the case.

Annular lichenoid dermatitis of youth, also known as annular pustulosis of childhood, is a rare, benign, and self-limiting dermatosis that typically affects children and young adults. It is characterized by the development of erythematous, annular, or polycyclic patches on the trunk, arms, and legs, with a tendency to involve the flexural areas. The lesions are usually asymptomatic or mildly itchy.

The clinical features described in the case, such as the presence of erythematous annular patches on the abdomen, lower back, groin, wrists, and legs, with slightly raised red-brown borders and a clear center, are consistent with annular lichenoid dermatitis of youth. The absence of any other underlying conditions, such as atopic dermatitis or other eczematous dermatoses, and the lack of any associated extracutaneous symptoms, also support this diagnosis.

The histopathological findings, as shown in Figure B and C, are also consistent with annular lichenoid dermatitis of youth. The superficial lymphocytic infiltrates in the papillary and superficial reticular dermis, as well as the prominent vacuolar changes at the dermoepidermal junction, are characteristic features of this condition. The mild lymphocytic exocytosis also supports this diagnosis.

**Answer**: C. Erythema induratum

Erythema induratum is a cutaneous condition characterized by the development of painful, indurated plaques on the legs, often associated with ulceration. The patient's symptoms, including the appearance of the ulcer and plaques, their location on the legs, and the absence of fever, chills, weight loss, dyspnea, chest pain, cough, or hemoptysis, are consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of moving to Canada from China 30 years ago and being unsure about tuberculosis (TB) exposure and Bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccine status increases the likelihood of this diagnosis, as Erythema induratum is a condition that is associated with TB infection.

Infective panniculitides, represented by answer A, is a broader term that refers to a group of conditions characterized by inflammation of the subcutaneous fat. While this diagnosis could potentially be considered given the patient's symptoms, the absence of fever, chills, weight loss, dyspnea, chest pain, cough, or hemoptysis and the patient's history of TB exposure make Erythema induratum a more likely diagnosis.

Erythema nodosum, represented by answer B, is a condition characterized by the development of tender, red nodules on the shins. While this diagnosis could potentially be considered given the patient's symptoms, the absence of fever, chills, weight loss, dyspnea, chest pain, cough, or hemoptysis and the patient's history of TB exposure make Erythema induratum a more likely diagnosis.

Pyoderma gangrenosum, represented by answer D, is a condition characterized by the development of painful, necrotic ulcers on the skin. While this diagnosis could potentially be considered given the patient's symptoms, the absence of fever, chills, weight loss, dyspnea, chest pain, cough, or hemoptysis and the patient's history of TB exposure make Erythema induratum a more likely diagnosis.

**Answer**: B. Prurigo pigmentosa

Prurigo pigmentosa is a chronic skin condition characterized by the development of crusted, erythematous papules and nodules, often in a reticular or linear pattern. The condition typically affects the trunk, arms, and legs, and can be associated with significant pruritus.

In this case, the patient presented with a 6-year history of recurrent, pruritic skin eruptions involving the middle and lower back, with a striking reticular pattern. The patient had undergone a skin biopsy that showed spongiotic dermatitis, and had been treated with potent topical corticosteroids and oral prednisone without improvement. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of prurigo pigmentosa.

The other answer choices are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's history and physical examination findings:

A. Erythema ab igne: This is a condition that occurs when the skin is exposed to repeated or prolonged heat, leading to the development of erythematous patches or plaques. While the patient did not report using heating pads or space heaters, the reticular pattern of the eruption and the absence of any history of heat exposure make this diagnosis less likely.

C. Dowling-Degos disease: This is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the development of reticular, hyperpigmented macules and papules on the skin. The condition typically affects the flexural areas, such as the neck, axillae, and inguinal region, and can be associated with other systemic manifestations such as cardiac and neurological abnormalities. While the patient's reticular pattern and hyperpigmentation are consistent with Dowling-Degos disease, the absence of any other systemic manifestations and the patient's age (in her 20s) make this diagnosis less likely.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain why C. Germinoma is the correct answer and why the other choices are incorrect.

**Answer**: C. Germinoma

Germinoma is a type of germ cell tumor that originates from the germ cells that are present in the brain during fetal development. These tumors are rare and typically affect children and young adults. The patient's symptoms of cognitive and behavioral changes, headaches, and progressively worsening weakness of the left arm and leg, as well as the MRI findings of a lesion in the right basal ganglia and thalamus with heterogeneous high signal intensity and multicystic change, are consistent with a germinoma.

The patient's history of a previous admission for weakness of the left fingers and mild spasticity of the left lower extremity, as well as the lack of any other mass lesions or abnormalities on angiography, also support the diagnosis of a germinoma. Additionally, the patient's age and the absence of any family history of tumors elsewhere suggest that a germinoma is a more likely diagnosis than other types of brain tumors.

The other choices are less likely diagnoses for the patient's symptoms and MRI findings.

A. Glioma: A glioma is a type of brain tumor that originates from the supporting cells of the brain called glial cells. While gliomas can cause similar symptoms to germinomas, such as cognitive changes and weakness, they typically do not have the same MRI findings as germinomas. Gliomas are more common in older adults, and the patient's age and lack of any family history of tumors elsewhere make it less likely that a glioma is the correct diagnosis.

B. Infarction: An infarction is an area of dead tissue that results from a lack of blood supply. While an infarction can cause weakness or paralysis of a limb, it typically does not cause cognitive changes or headaches. Additionally, the MRI findings of a lesion in the right basal ganglia and thalamus with heterogeneous high signal intensity and multicystic change are not consistent with an infarction.

**Answer**: B. Waardenburg syndrome type 1

Waardenburg syndrome type 1 is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of the eyes, hair, and nervous system. It is characterized by a combination of symptoms, including:

* Lateral displacement of the inner canthi (the inner corners of the eyes)
* Broad nasal root
* Small nostrils
* Medial eyebrow flare
* Hypopigmentation (lightening of the skin and hair)
* Blue eyes

The child and his father in the case study both demonstrate lateral displacement of the inner canthi, which is a key diagnostic feature of Waardenburg syndrome type 1. Additionally, the father's hypopigmented patch on the left arm and bright blue eyes are also consistent with the syndrome.

The other answer choices are not correct for the following reasons:

* A. Stickler syndrome: This is a genetic disorder that affects the development of the eyes, ears, and joints. It is characterized by a flat nasal bridge, small jaw, and joint pain. While the child in the case study has a broad nasal root, it is not flat, and there is no mention of joint pain or other skeletal abnormalities.
* C. X-linked Alport syndrome: This is a genetic disorder that affects the development of the eyes, ears, and kidneys. It is characterized by progressive hearing loss, vision loss, and kidney damage. While the child in the case study has normal hearing and vision, and there is no mention of kidney problems, X-linked Alport syndrome is a possibility. However, the father's symptoms do not match this diagnosis, as he does not have hearing loss or kidney problems.
* D. Autosomal dominant GJB2 gene mutation: This is a genetic mutation that can cause hearing loss and other symptoms. However, the child in the case study has normal hearing, and there is no mention of other symptoms consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the father's symptoms do not match this diagnosis, as he does not have hearing loss.

**Answer**: C. Adenocarcinoma

The correct answer is C. Adenocarcinoma because the patient's symptoms and test results indicate a possible malignancy in the colon. The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis, which is a known risk factor for the development of colorectal cancer. The patient's abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss are consistent with a possible obstruction or mass in the colon. The computed tomographic scan of the abdomen/pelvis showed a thickened colon from the middescending colon to the rectosigmoid, which could indicate a mass or obstruction. Additionally, the presence of an intramural abscess in the descending colon suggests that there may be a perforation or hole in the colon wall, which could be a sign of malignancy.

The patient's colonoscopy showed multiple areas of inflammation in the rectum through the descending colon, which could be indicative of a malignancy. The fact that nothing proximal to the midtransverse colon was visualized because of a large fecal burden suggests that there may be a significant amount of inflammation or obstruction in the colon, which could be caused by a malignancy.

While ulcerative colitis flare (choice A) and conversion to Crohn disease (choice B) are possible explanations for the patient's symptoms, the patient's history of ulcerative colitis and the presence of an intramural abscess suggest that malignancy is a more likely diagnosis. Lymphoma (choice D) is a possibility, but it is less likely than adenocarcinoma given the patient's symptoms and test results.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and test results, the most likely diagnosis is adenocarcinoma of the colon.

**Answer**: B. Perform pars plana vitrectomy with subretinal biopsy

The patient's symptoms of blurry vision, floaters, and persistent fevers, along with the physical examination findings of multiple yellow-white subretinal lesions with associated hemorrhages and vitritis, suggest a possible diagnosis of infectious retinitis. This is a medical emergency that requires prompt treatment to prevent further vision loss.

Option B, perform pars plana vitrectomy with subretinal biopsy, is the most appropriate next step in management. This procedure involves removing the vitreous gel and biopsying the subretinal tissue to establish a definitive diagnosis and provide appropriate treatment. The presence of vitritis and subretinal lesions suggests that the infection has breached the blood-retina barrier, making systemic antimicrobials less effective.

Option A, vitreous tap and inject, may be considered in some cases of suspected endophthalmitis, but it is not appropriate in this scenario. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a more severe infection, and a vitreous tap may not provide sufficient tissue for diagnosis. Additionally, injecting antibiotics into the vitreous may not effectively treat the infection in this case.

Option C, change systemic antimicrobials, may be considered if the patient's condition does not improve with the current antimicrobial regimen. However, given the severity of the patient's symptoms and examination findings, it is unlikely that changing systemic antimicrobials alone would be sufficient to treat the infection.

Option D, perform lumbar puncture, is not directly related to the patient's ocular symptoms and is not the most appropriate next step in management. While a lumbar puncture may be necessary to evaluate for meningitis or other central nervous system infections, it would not provide information about the retinal infection.

Therefore, option B, perform pars plana vitrectomy with subretinal biopsy, is the most appropriate next step in management to diagnose and treat the patient's infectious retinitis.

**A: Observe the patient**
This answer is incorrect because the patient has a large foreign body (FB) in the right orbit that is abutting the inferior rectus muscle, which could potentially cause further damage to the eye and surrounding tissues. Observing the patient without taking any action could lead to worsening of the condition and potential vision loss.

**B: Obtain a magnetic resonance imaging study to further delineate the soft tissue injury**
This answer is incorrect because while an MRI study may be useful in evaluating the soft tissue injury, it is not the most appropriate next step in management. The immediate concern is the presence of a large foreign body in the right orbit that needs to be removed.

**C: Repair canalicular lacerations and leave the foreign body in place**
This answer is incorrect because the foreign body is large and in close proximity to the inferior rectus muscle, which could potentially cause further damage to the eye and surrounding tissues. Leaving the foreign body in place would not address the underlying problem and could lead to worsening of the condition.

**D: Repair canalicular lacerations and perform an orbitotomy for FB removal**
This answer is correct because it addresses the immediate concern of the foreign body in the right orbit. Repairing the canalicular lacerations would help to restore the normal anatomy of the eye and prevent further damage. Performing an orbitotomy would allow for the safe removal of the foreign body, which would help to prevent further damage to the eye and surrounding tissues.

Therefore, the correct answer is D: Repair canalicular lacerations and perform an orbitotomy for FB removal.

The correct answer is C. Review medical and family history for hypercoagulable or inflammatory systemic diseases.

The patient's symptoms of sudden onset of blurry vision in one eye, along with the physical examination findings of tortuosity and dilation of all branches of the retinal vein, disc edema, scattered intraretinal hemorrhages, and nasal macula nerve fiber layer infarcts, suggest a possible diagnosis of retinal vein occlusion (RVO). RVO is a blockage of the small veins that carry blood away from the retina, leading to a buildup of pressure and fluid in the retina.

It is important to review the patient's medical and family history to identify any potential risk factors for RVO, such as hypercoagulable or inflammatory systemic diseases. Hypercoagulable states, such as those caused by oral contraceptives, pregnancy, or autoimmune disorders, can increase the risk of RVO. Inflammatory systemic diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus or sarcoidosis, can also increase the risk of RVO.

Option A, Perform intravitreal corticosteroid injection, may be a reasonable next step in the management of the patient's condition, but it is not the most appropriate answer at this point in the decision-making process. Intravitreal corticosteroid injections can be used to treat macular edema and reduce inflammation, but they are not a diagnostic test and will not help determine the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

Option B, Perform intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor injection, is also not the most appropriate answer at this point. While anti-VEGF injections can be used to treat retinal diseases such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy, they are not typically used to treat RVO.

**Answer**:C. Initiate RIPE therapy

The patient's symptoms and test results suggest that they have ocular tuberculosis, which is an uncommon extrapulmonary manifestation of tuberculosis. The patient's history of cigarette use and alcohol dependence may have compromised their immune system, making them more susceptible to tuberculosis infection.

The patient's positive proteinase 3–antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) testing and interferon γ release assay using QuantiFERON-TB gold (QFT) (Qiagen) results support the diagnosis of tuberculosis. The negative results of sputum culture and polymerase chain reaction for Mycobacteria tuberculosis do not rule out the diagnosis, as the infection may be localized to the eye.

The patient's chest computed tomography showing tiny, scattered solid pulmonary nodules that were too small to characterize according to the radiology department suggests that the infection may have spread to the lungs. However, the patient's pulmonology evaluation determined that the pulmonary nodules were too small for biopsy via bronchoscopy.

Given the patient's symptoms and test results, the best course of action is to initiate rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol (RIPE) therapy, which is the standard treatment for tuberculosis. This will help to treat the patient's ocular tuberculosis and prevent further spread of the infection to other parts of the body.

Option A, perform an incisional biopsy, may not be necessary given the patient's positive ANCA and QFT results, which support the diagnosis of tuberculosis. Additionally, biopsy may not be feasible due to the location of the infection.

Option B, prescribe oral prednisone, may not be effective in treating the patient's tuberculosis infection, as corticosteroids are not active against Mycobacteria tuberculosis.

Option D, inject sub-Tenon triamcinolone, is not appropriate for treating tuberculosis infection. In

**Answer**:D. Advanced desmoplastic small round cell tumor

The patient's symptoms, such as abdominal pain, weight loss, and abdominal distension, along with the presence of numerous abdominal and pelvic masses on imaging, suggest a diagnosis of advanced cancer. The patient's history of a small mass in the right scrotum that was previously evaluated and deemed nonmalignant, and the lack of significant β-human chorionic gonadotropin and α-fetoprotein levels, make metastatic testicular carcinoma (choice C) less likely. The presence of a 3.9-cm enhancing lesion in the left hepatic lobe and the positive FISH for EWS-WT1 rearrangement support the diagnosis of advanced desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT). DSRCT is a rare and aggressive type of cancer that typically affects the abdominal cavity and often presents with symptoms similar to those of the patient. The positive staining for cytokeratin and desmin and negative staining for S100 also support this diagnosis.

In contrast, metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma (choice A) is less likely given the lack of significant β-human chorionic gonadotropin and α-fetoprotein levels, and the absence of neuroendocrine features on histology. Metastatic gastrointestinal stromal tumor (choice B) is also less likely given the lack of GI symptoms and the absence of GI tract involvement on imaging.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Advanced desmoplastic small round cell tumor.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is C. Order cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.

The patient's symptoms of palpitations, breathlessness, chest pain, and light-headedness suggest that she may have a cardiac arrhythmia, and the family history of sudden cardiac death increases the likelihood of an underlying cardiac condition. The physical examination and electrocardiogram (ECG) do not provide enough information to determine the cause of the symptoms.

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive test that can provide detailed information about the structure and function of the heart, including the left ventricle, which is the main pumping chamber of the heart. MRI can help identify any abnormalities in the heart muscle, such as scar tissue or inflammation, which could be causing the patient's symptoms. Additionally, MRI can assess the heart's function and identify any areas of the heart that may be affected by a cardiac arrhythmia.

In contrast, choice A, conducting an invasive electrophysiological study, may be necessary later on in the patient's care, but it is not the most appropriate next step. This test involves inserting catheters into the heart to record electrical activity and would be done to confirm the diagnosis of a cardiac arrhythmia, but it is not necessary at this point in the patient's care.

Choice B, implanting a device to determine frequency of ventricular tachycardia, is also not the most appropriate next step. While this device may be necessary in the future to monitor the patient's heart rhythm, it is not necessary at this point in the patient's care.

Choice D, ordering cardiac positron emission tomography, is also not the most appropriate next step. This test is used to visualize the blood flow to the heart, but it is not necessary at this point in the patient's care.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in the patient's care would be to order cardiac magnetic resonance imaging to further evaluate the patient's symptoms and determine the underlying cause of her cardiac arrhythmia.

**Answer**: D. Cervical lymphatic malformation

The patient's symptoms, such as dyspnea, limited neck movements, and neck tightness, are consistent with a large neck mass. The MRI findings, including the homogenous ovoid bilobulated cystic mass with fibrous septae in the central and inferior parts, extension to the supraclavicular region, and no sign of invasion, are also consistent with a lymphatic malformation. Additionally, the gradual and continuous growth of the swelling over 12 months suggests a benign entity.

Branchial cleft cysts are rare congenital anomalies that occur in the lateral neck and are typically diagnosed in childhood. They are not usually associated with gradual and continuous growth in adults.

Glomus tumors are rare, usually benign, tumors that arise from the glomus cells of the paraganglia. They are typically located at the carotid bifurcation and are not usually associated with a large, bilobulated cystic mass in the lateral neck.

Liposarcoma is a type of soft tissue sarcoma that can occur in the neck, but it is not typically associated with a cystic mass with fibrous septae.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, MRI findings, and clinical history, the most likely diagnosis is a cervical lymphatic malformation.

**Answer**:B. Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder

The patient's symptoms of throat pain and swelling, accompanied by bilateral tonsillar erythema, exudate, tenderness, and peritonsillar edema, are consistent with a posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). PTLD is a known complication of solid organ transplantation, and it can present with a variety of symptoms, including throat pain and swelling. The patient's history of bilateral lung transplantation 4 months prior to the onset of symptoms increases the likelihood of PTLD.

The patient's nasal endoscopy findings of nasopharyngeal soft-tissue swelling with mucopurulent secretions on the left side, as well as the computed tomographic scan with contrast showing a rim-enhancing, multilocular hypodense collection extending from the left nasopharynx inferiorly to the level of the right palatine tonsil, are also consistent with PTLD.

The patient's urgent referral to the operating room for intraoperative endoscopy, which revealed ulceration and necrotic debris in the nasopharynx and oropharynx, further supports the diagnosis of PTLD. Culture and biopsy specimens were obtained, which will help to confirm the diagnosis.

Mycobacterial abscess (choice A) is less likely, as the patient's symptoms and findings on nasal endoscopy and computed tomography do not suggest a typical mycobacterial infection. Acute invasive fungal sinusitis (choice C) is also less likely, as the patient's symptoms and findings do not suggest a fungal infection. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (choice D) is a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's age and history of lung transplantation.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and radiographic evidence, the most likely diagnosis is posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (choice B).

**Answer**: C. Fibrous dysplasia

Fibrous dysplasia is a benign condition that affects the bones and can cause them to become enlarged or deformed. It is characterized by the replacement of normal bone tissue with fibrous tissue, which can lead to the formation of bony masses or lesions. In this case, the patient presented with multiple slowly growing masses of the face and head, which is consistent with fibrous dysplasia. Additionally, the patient's medical history was otherwise unremarkable, and there were no clinical signs of endocrinopathy, which also supports the diagnosis of fibrous dysplasia.

Now, let's discuss why the other answer choices are incorrect:

A. Florid osseous dysplasia: This is a rare condition that is characterized by the proliferation of bone tissue, leading to the formation of multiple bony masses or lesions. However, it is different from fibrous dysplasia in that it is typically associated with other skeletal abnormalities, such as short stature, scoliosis, and ribcage deformities. Additionally, the bony masses in florid osseous dysplasia are typically larger and more numerous than those seen in fibrous dysplasia.

B. Paget disease of bone: This is a condition that causes the bones to become enlarged and deformed due to abnormal bone remodeling. However, it is typically associated with other symptoms such as bone pain, joint pain, and elevated levels of alkaline phosphatase in the blood. Additionally, Paget disease of bone typically affects older adults, whereas fibrous dysplasia can affect people of any age.

D. Gardner syndrome: This is a rare genetic condition that is characterized by the development of multiple benign tumors, including osteochondromas (bone tumors) and fibromas (connective tissue tumors). However, Gardner syndrome is typically associated with other symptoms such as colon polyps, skin changes, and eye abnormalities, which were not mentioned in the patient's history.

**Answer**: C. Liposarcoma, pleomorphic myxoid variant

The correct answer is C. Liposarcoma, pleomorphic myxoid variant, because it best matches the patient's symptoms and the imaging findings described in the case.

Liposarcoma is a type of soft tissue sarcoma that arises in fat cells. The pleomorphic myxoid variant is a subtype of liposarcoma that is characterized by a mixture of myxoid (i.e., gelatinous) and pleomorphic (i.e., variable) features. This subtype typically affects the deep soft tissue of the extremities, and less frequently the head and neck region.

The patient's symptoms of left facial and eye pain with intermittent diplopia on upward and lateral gaze, along with the physical examination findings of left abducens nerve palsy and an afferent pupillary defect, are consistent with a mass affecting the left superior orbital fissure and cavernous sinus. The imaging findings of a well-circumscribed posterior-medial extraconal mass extending into the orbital apex with smooth, nonaggressive bony remodeling and expansion of the left superior orbital fissure with further dorsal extension into the left cavernous sinus are also consistent with a liposarcoma.

The negative FUS-CHOP fusion oncogene on fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) supports the diagnosis of pleomorphic myxoid liposarcoma, as this subtype is known to be negative for FUS-CHOP fusion.

In contrast, option A, lipoblastoma, is a benign tumor that arises in the fat cells of the orbit and is typically seen in children. It is unlikely to cause the symptoms and imaging findings described in this case.

Option B, liposarcoma, conventional myxoid variant, is a subtype of liposarcoma that is characterized by a myxoid stroma without pleomorphism. It is less likely to cause the symptoms and imaging findings described in this case compared to the pleomorphic myx

**Answer**:B. Perform immunohistochemical analysis on the biopsy specimen

The correct answer is B, Perform immunohistochemical analysis on the biopsy specimen, because it is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's condition.

The patient has a history of pyogenic granuloma, which is a benign vascular tumor that can mimic malignancy. However, the presence of atypical epithelioid and spindled cells adjacent to blood vessels raises the possibility of a more aggressive lesion, such as a sarcoma. Immunohistochemical analysis can help to differentiate between these entities by identifying specific markers that are associated with malignancy.

Option A, Treat with cryotherapy, is not appropriate because cryotherapy is typically used for precancerous or cancerous lesions, and it would not provide a definitive diagnosis.

Option C, Perform tissue culture for bacterial and fungal organisms, may be appropriate if there is a concern for infection, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, given the patient's history and the histopathologic findings.

Option D, Provide reassurance, is not appropriate because the patient has a concerning history and symptoms, and a definitive diagnosis has not been established.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to perform an immunohistochemical analysis on the biopsy specimen to further evaluate the nature of the lesion and guide management accordingly.

**Answer**:B. Replace heparin with argatroban for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia.

The correct answer is B because the patient has developed heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), which is a life-threatening complication of heparin therapy. HIT is caused by the formation of antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4), which is a protein released from platelets and bound to heparin. The antibodies can cause platelet activation and thrombosis, which can lead to serious complications such as pulmonary embolism, stroke, and limb ischemia.

The patient's laboratory results show a significant drop in platelet count, which is consistent with HIT. The presence of new thrombi in the left femoral vein and pulmonary embolism also support this diagnosis. Therefore, it is appropriate to discontinue heparin and replace it with argatroban, a direct thrombin inhibitor that does not interact with platelets and is not associated with HIT.

Option A, continuing heparin for new thrombosis, is not appropriate because heparin is the likely cause of the HIT and continuing it may worsen the thrombocytopenia and increase the risk of further thrombotic complications.

Option C, replacing piperacillin-tazobactam with meropenem for antibiotic-induced thrombocytopenia, is not appropriate because there is no evidence to suggest that the patient's thrombocytopenia is caused by the antibiotic.

Option D, transfusing platelets for risk of postoperative bleeding, may be appropriate, but it is not the most urgent intervention needed in this situation. The patient's thrombocytopenia is severe and may lead to life-threatening bleeding, so it is important to address the underlying cause of the thrombocytopenia first. Once the HIT is under control, platelet transfusions may be considered to prevent bleeding complications.

**Answer**:C. Post–kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL)

Explanation:
The correct diagnosis is Post–kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) because the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with this condition. PKDL is a complication of visceral leishmaniasis (kala-azar) that occurs when the parasite migrates to the skin, causing skin lesions and ulcers. The patient's nonhealing ulcer on the left foot and the multiple hypopigmented asymptomatic lesions on his face and scalp are characteristic of PKDL. The patient's history of multibacillary leprosy and previous treatment with multidrug therapy increase the likelihood of PKDL.

Option A, Borderline lepromatous leprosy with trophic ulcer, is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not match the characteristics of borderline lepromatous leprosy. The patient does not have the typical skin lesions or peripheral nerve involvement seen in leprosy.

Option B, Tropical phagedenic ulcer, is also incorrect because the patient's ulcer is not consistent with the typical features of a tropical phagedenic ulcer. The patient's ulcer is well-defined with regular margins, and the floor is covered by a yellowish slough, which is not consistent with the irregular, ragged edges and necrotic base of a tropical phagedenic ulcer.

Option D, Cutaneous diphtheria, is unlikely because the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not match the characteristics of cutaneous diphtheria. The patient does not have the typical skin lesions or pseudomembranes seen in cutaneous diphtheria. Additionally, the patient's history of multibacillary leprosy and previous treatment with multidrug therapy make it less likely that the patient has cutaneous diphtheria.

**Answer**:C. Cutaneous collagenous vasculopathy (CCV)

The correct answer is C. Cutaneous collagenous vasculopathy (CCV) because it matches the given case's characteristics, such as:

1. Appearance: CCV typically presents as small, blanchable, salmon-colored, or red macules and patches, which is consistent with the patient's 1-year history of blanchable, salmon-colored, monomorphic macules and fine telangiectasias localized to her right lower leg.
2. Distribution: CCV often affects the lower extremities, as seen in this case where the patch had slowly enlarged since initial onset, but remained confined to the single extremity.
3. Histopathology: The histopathology findings in this case, such as concentric deposits of hyaline material surrounding dilated and markedly thickened capillaries within the papillary dermis, are consistent with CCV. The perivascular hyaline deposits are also highlighted strongly by periodic acid–Schiff stain, which supports the diagnosis.
4. Lack of systemic symptoms: The patient did not report any systemic symptoms such as bleeding tendencies or hypercoagulability, which is consistent with CCV being a benign and asymptomatic condition.

In contrast, the other options do not match the case's characteristics:

A. Essential telangiectasia: This condition typically presents with numerous small, red, blanchable macules on the trunk and limbs, which is not consistent with the single, localized patch on the patient's right lower leg.

B. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis: This condition is characterized by inflammation and destruction of blood vessels, which is not seen in the histopathology findings of this case.

D. Pigmented purpuric dermatosis, Schamberg type: This condition typically presents with purpuric, petechial, or ecchymotic lesions, which is not consistent with the patient's salmon-colored, monomorphic macules and fine telangiectasias.

**Answer**:B. Brown tumor

The patient's symptoms, such as severe fatigue, cachexia, and muscular weakness, along with the presence of a large tumor on the distal part of the right fourth finger, are consistent with a Brown tumor. Brown tumors are a type of benign bone tumor that can occur in patients with hyperparathyroidism, which is also present in this patient. The patient's history of primary hyperparathyroidism 6 years prior to presentation and the laboratory evaluation revealing hypercalcemia and elevated serum parathyroid hormone levels support this diagnosis.

The histopathological analysis of the skin biopsy, which showed numerous giant cells with multiple osteoclast-like nuclei and giant multinucleated cells dispersed in contact with fibers associated with the presence of a few small vessels, is also consistent with a Brown tumor.

The other options are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and laboratory results:

A. Giant cell tumor: This is a type of bone tumor that typically affects the long bones and is characterized by the presence of giant cells. While the patient's tumor does contain giant cells, the presence of hyperparathyroidism and the patient's age make Brown tumor a more likely diagnosis.

C. Giant cell granuloma: This is a rare benign tumor that typically affects the jaw or skull bones. It is characterized by the presence of multinucleated giant cells and a granulomatous inflammatory response. While the patient's tumor does contain giant cells, the presence of hyperparathyroidism and the patient's age make Brown tumor a more likely diagnosis.

D. Chondromyxoid fibroma: This is a rare benign tumor that typically affects the cartilaginous tissue of the bones. It is characterized by the presence of chondromyxoid tissue and a lobulated or nodular growth pattern. The patient's tumor does not have these features, and the presence of hyperparathyroidism and the patient's age make Brown tumor a more likely diagnosis.

**Answer**:C. Monilethrix

The correct answer is C. Monilethrix.

Monilethrix is a rare genetic disorder that affects the hair growth cycle, leading to brittle, short, and thin hairs. The condition is characterized by a beaded appearance of the hair shaft, which is evident in the light microscopy image provided (Figure, B). The patient's symptoms, such as the loss of normal hair and replacement with "peach fuzz," and the family history of similar hair loss in the maternal grandmother and cousin, also support this diagnosis.

Tinea capitis (choice A) is a fungal infection of the scalp that can cause hair loss, but it typically presents with scaling, inflammation, and broken hairs. The patient's hair loss is not consistent with this condition, and there is no mention of scalp lesions or inflammation.

Psoriasis (choice B) is a chronic skin condition that can affect the scalp and cause hair loss. However, psoriasis typically presents with red, scaly patches and thickened skin, which are not mentioned in the patient's history.

Menkes disease (choice D) is a rare genetic disorder that affects copper metabolism and can cause hair loss. However, Menkes disease typically presents with a distinctive "steely" gray or white hair color, which is not mentioned in the patient's history. Additionally, the patient's age and developmental milestones do not fit with the typical presentation of Menkes disease, which typically becomes apparent in infancy.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and family history, as well as the results of the trichographic examination, the most likely diagnosis is Monilethrix.

**Answer**: C. Intramural small-bowel hematoma

The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and vomiting, along with the physical examination findings of tenderness in the left abdominal region without guarding, suggest an intra-abdominal injury. The laboratory results show a mild elevation in the hemoglobin level and amylase, which support the diagnosis of an intra-abdominal injury. The plain chest radiography result showed no signs of traumatic injury, which suggests that the injury is not in the chest cavity.

Abdominal ultrasonography showed a bowel loop with a thickened wall in the left abdominal region, which is consistent with an intramural hematoma. Computed tomography with oral and intravenous contrast (Figure 1) showed a well-defined, crescent-shaped lesion within the wall of the small intestine, which is consistent with an intramural small-bowel hematoma.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not support the diagnosis of abdominal wall hematoma (choice A). The patient does not have signs of peritonitis or perforation, which makes small-bowel perforation (choice B) less likely. Traumatic pancreatic injury (choice D) is also less likely, as the patient does not have symptoms or laboratory results consistent with pancreatic injury.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Intramural small-bowel hematoma.

**Answer**: C. Heterotopic pregnancy with normal intrauterine gestation and ruptured tubal pregnancy with hemoperitoneum and a normal appendix.

The patient's symptoms of right lower quadrant pain, numbness in the right lower limb, and nausea and vomiting, along with the positive Blumberg sign and the presence of a tubular structure in the right iliac fossa on ultrasound, suggest a possible diagnosis of appendicitis. However, the patient's history of early pregnancy and the absence of any shift in the white blood cell count or elevation of the C-reactive protein suggest that the diagnosis may be more complex.

The correct answer, C. Heterotopic pregnancy with normal intrauterine gestation and ruptured tubal pregnancy with hemoperitoneum and a normal appendix, takes into account the patient's pregnancy and the presence of a tubular structure in the right iliac fossa. Heterotopic pregnancy is a condition where the fertilized egg implants outside of the uterus, usually in the fallopian tube. In this case, the patient had a normal intrauterine pregnancy, but also had a ruptured tubal pregnancy, which can cause bleeding and pain in the right lower quadrant. The presence of hemoperitoneum, or blood in the peritoneal cavity, is consistent with this diagnosis. The normal appendix and lack of other signs of appendicitis support this diagnosis over acute appendicitis (choice A).

Salpingitis or sactosalpinx (choice B) is an inflammation of the fallopian tube, which can cause similar symptoms, but would not explain the presence of a normal intrauterine pregnancy. Heterotopic pregnancy is a more specific diagnosis that takes into account both the intrauterine pregnancy and the tubal pregnancy.

Nonspecific abdominal pain or pelvic inflammatory disease (choice D) is a broad diagnosis that does not take into account the specific symptoms and findings in this case.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is D. Observe.

The patient presented with new-onset floaters in both eyes, which could be due to various causes such as retinal detachment, retinal tears, or vitreomacular traction. However, the patient's history of recent West Nile virus encephalitis and the absence of any other symptoms such as blurry vision, eye pain, or photopsia suggest that the floaters may be related to the viral infection.

The patient's examination findings, including microaneurysms, a dot-blot hemorrhage, and scattered, deep, white, chorioretinal lesions, are consistent with a diagnosis of acute retinal necrosis (ARN), a rare complication of West Nile virus infection. ARN is characterized by the presence of multiple, scattered, deep, white, chorioretinal lesions, often with a creamy or yellowish appearance.

Given the patient's history and examination findings, it is likely that the floaters are due to ARN. Therefore, the next step would be to observe the patient closely to monitor the progression of the disease and to assess the response to treatment.

Ordering a vitreous biopsy (choice A) may not be necessary at this point, as the diagnosis of ARN can be made based on the clinical findings and the patient's history. Additionally, vitreous biopsy carries some risks, such as retinal damage, and may not provide a definitive diagnosis.

Ordering magnetic resonance imaging of the brain (choice B) may also not be necessary at this point, as the patient's recent history of West Nile virus encephalitis and the absence of any other symptoms suggest that the floaters are likely related to the viral infection.

Ordering a biopsy of the chorioretinal lesion (choice C) may also not be necessary, as the diagnosis of ARN can be made based on the clinical findings and the patient's history. Additionally, biopsy carries some risks, such as retinal damage, and may not provide a definitive diagnosis.

**Answer**:C. Order magnetic resonance imaging for the orbits and brain

The correct answer is C. Order magnetic resonance imaging for the orbits and brain because it is necessary to evaluate the extent of the lymphoma infiltration in the central nervous system. The patient's symptoms of blurry vision, bilateral eyelid, lip, and feet swelling, and new-onset right facial palsy suggest a possible involvement of the central nervous system by the lymphoma. The optic nerve head edema and peripapillary hemorrhages bilaterally, greater in the left eye than in the right eye, also support this possibility.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the imaging modality of choice for evaluating the central nervous system, and it can help to identify any infiltration or compression of the optic nerves, chiasm, or brain by the lymphoma. This information is crucial in determining the appropriate management and treatment plan for the patient.

Option A, Observe, is not appropriate because the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a more severe condition that requires prompt evaluation and management.

Option B, Perform a lumbar puncture, may be necessary later to confirm the diagnosis of lymphoma, but it is not the most appropriate next step. A lumbar puncture carries a risk of further neurological damage if the patient has a space-occupying lesion in the central nervous system, and it may not provide sufficient information to guide management.

Option D, Perform optic nerve decompression, may be necessary later as a treatment option, but it is not the most appropriate next step. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a more severe condition that requires prompt evaluation and management, and optic nerve decompression may not address the underlying cause of the symptoms.

**Answer**: D. Order visual field testing and observe closely for serous macular detachment

Explanation:

A. Order magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits: While MRI can help diagnose conditions such as optic nerve damage or compressive lesions, it may not be the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a localized peripapillary issue, and MRI may not provide the necessary details of the affected area.

B. Immediately demarcate the region with indirect argon laser barricade: This option is not appropriate as it is not clear whether the peripapillary changes are due to a benign or malignant process. Laser treatment may not be necessary or appropriate at this stage, and further evaluation is needed before considering any interventional measures.

C. Order indocyanine green angiography and photodynamic therapy: Indocyanine green angiography can help evaluate the choroidal circulation, but it may not be the most appropriate test in this case. Photodynamic therapy is typically used for treatment of certain retinal diseases, but it is not indicated based on the patient's current findings.

D. Order visual field testing and observe closely for serous macular detachment: This option is the most appropriate next step. Visual field testing can help assess the patient's peripheral vision and detect any potential field defects related to the peripapillary changes. Given the patient's symptoms and examination findings, it is essential to monitor the situation closely, and visual field testing can help in this regard. Additionally, serous macular detachment is a possible complication of peripapillary changes, and close observation is necessary to detect any changes in the macula.

**Answer**: D. Perform exploratory surgery in the operating room and start a high dose of systemic steroids

The patient's symptoms of pain and redness, along with the physical examination findings of episcleritis and a creamy fluctuant elevated lesion, suggest a possible inflammatory or infectious process. The fact that the patient's symptoms intensified despite topical prednisolone therapy also suggests that the current treatment may not be effective in managing the underlying condition.

Option A, obtaining cultures at the slitlamp, may be appropriate in cases where there is a suspicion of an infectious process, but it is not the most appropriate step in this scenario. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a more urgent need for intervention, and obtaining cultures may not provide a swift diagnosis or treatment.

Option B, performing a vitreous tap and injecting antibiotics, may be appropriate in cases of suspected endophthalmitis, but it is not the most appropriate step in this scenario. The patient's symptoms and examination findings do not suggest endophthalmitis, and performing a vitreous tap may not provide a definitive diagnosis or effective treatment.

Option C, performing exploratory surgery in the operating room and starting intravenous antibiotics, may be appropriate in cases where there is a suspicion of an infectious process, but it is not the most appropriate step in this scenario. While exploratory surgery may be necessary to diagnose and treat the underlying condition, starting intravenous antibiotics may not be the most effective treatment for an inflammatory or infectious process that is not clearly defined.

Option D, performing exploratory surgery in the operating room and starting a high dose of systemic steroids, is the most appropriate step in this scenario. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a possible inflammatory or infectious process that may require surgical intervention. Starting a high dose of systemic steroids may help to reduce inflammation and manage the underlying condition, and may be a more effective treatment than topical prednisolone therapy.

**Answer**:C. Inflammatory reaction

The patient's history of recurrent oral cancer and recent positron emission tomography (PET) scan findings suggest that the patient has a high likelihood of having a hypermetabolic vocal cord focus due to an inflammatory reaction. The patient's history of tobacco use and recurrent laryngeal nerve injury further support this diagnosis.

Option A, metastatic squamous cell carcinoma, is unlikely given the patient's history of recurrent oral cancer and the lack of any other mucosal lesions. Additionally, the PET scan findings do not suggest any distant metastasis.

Option B, primary laryngeal carcinoma in the setting of extensive, recurrent head and neck SCC, is also unlikely given the patient's history of recurrent oral cancer and the lack of any other mucosal lesions. Furthermore, the patient's age and history of tobacco use make it less likely for a primary laryngeal carcinoma.

Option D, postradiation change, is unlikely given the patient's history of recurrent oral cancer and the lack of any radiation therapy in her treatment history.

Therefore, option C, inflammatory reaction, is the most likely diagnosis for the patient's hypermetabolic vocal cord focus.

The case presented is a 26-year-old man with progressive muscle weakness, worsening dyspnea on exertion, and leg swelling, with a family history of early death of a maternal uncle due to congestive heart failure and a younger brother with progressive weakness but no dyspnea. The patient's physical examination, laboratory results, and echocardiography suggest the possibility of an inherited cardiomyopathy.

Genetic testing is the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic workup of this patient. It can help identify specific genetic mutations that may be associated with inherited cardiomyopathies, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, or arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Genetic testing can also help determine if the patient's family members are at risk of inheriting the same condition.

The other options are not the most appropriate next steps in the diagnostic workup of this patient:

A. Treadmill stress test: While a treadmill stress test may be useful in evaluating the patient's exercise capacity and identifying any ischemic changes, it may not provide definitive information about the underlying cardiomyopathy.

B. Cardiac catheterization: Cardiac catheterization may be necessary in the future to evaluate the patient's coronary arteries and left ventricular function, but it is not the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic workup.

C. Electrophysiological study: An electrophysiological study may be useful in evaluating the patient's arrhythmia risk, but it is not the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic workup of an inherited cardiomyopathy.

A myopericytoma is a rare benign tumor that arises from the pericytes, which are cells that surround the small blood vessels in the soft tissues. The histopathological features described in the question, such as the presence of bland, vaguely spindled cells arranged around prominent thin-walled vessels with a "staghorn" branching configuration, are consistent with a myopericytoma.

The other answer choices do not match the given criteria:

A. Glomus tumor: A glomus tumor is a rare benign tumor that arises from the glomus cells, which are specialized cells that regulate the temperature and humidity of the air in the nasal cavity. The histopathological features described in the question do not match the characteristics of a glomus tumor, which typically shows a well-circumscribed, encapsulated lesion composed of polygonal cells with a distinctive "salt and pepper" appearance.

B. Myofibroma: A myofibroma is a rare benign tumor that arises from the myofibroblasts, which are cells that produce extracellular matrix components. The histopathological features described in the question do not match the characteristics of a myofibroma, which typically shows a well-circumscribed, encapsulated lesion composed of spindle-shaped cells with a characteristic "whorled" pattern.

C. Solitary fibrous tumor: A solitary fibrous tumor is a rare benign tumor that arises from the fibroblasts, which are cells that produce extracellular matrix components. The histopathological features described in the question do not match the characteristics of a solitary fibrous tumor, which typically shows a well-circumscribed, encapsulated lesion composed of spindle-shaped cells with a characteristic "patternless" appearance.

A. Merkel cell carcinoma is an aggressive skin cancer that typically affects the elderly and is associated with a high risk of metastasis. It is unlikely to present with a large, non-ulcerated mass in the base of the tongue, as described in the case. Additionally, Merkel cell carcinoma typically shows a distinctive histopathological pattern, with small, round cells with a "salt and pepper" appearance, which is not consistent with the sheet-like growth pattern and Azzopardi-type crush artifactual distortion described in the case.

B. Squamous cell carcinoma is a common type of skin cancer that can arise in various parts of the body, including the head and neck. However, it is unlikely to present with the histopathological features described in the case, such as the sheet-like growth pattern and positive immunoreactivity for synaptophysin. Squamous cell carcinoma typically shows a more irregular, papillary, or acanthotic pattern, and is often associated with keratinization and/or squamous differentiation.

D. Primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) is a rare, aggressive tumor that can arise in various parts of the body, including the head and neck. However, it is unlikely to present with the histopathological features described in the case, such as the sheet-like growth pattern and positive immunoreactivity for synaptophysin. PNETs typically show a more irregular, nested, or trabecular pattern, and are often associated with neuroendocrine differentiation.

Therefore, based on the histopathological features described in the case, the most likely diagnosis is small-cell carcinoma.

**Answer**:C. Intradiploic meningoencephalocele

The patient's symptoms of clear nasal discharge during activity, along with the imaging findings of a lytic lesion in the left occipital bone and a T2-weighted MRI sequence showing a lesion isointense to CSF with thinning of the bony cortex, are consistent with a diagnosis of intradiploic meningoencephalocele. This is a rare congenital malformation where a portion of the meninges protrudes through a defect in the skull and simulates a mass. The patient's history of meningitis and the presence of a CSF leak support this diagnosis.

Option A, multiple myeloma, is unlikely as the patient does not have any symptoms or signs of multiple myeloma such as bone pain, anemia, infection, or renal failure. Also, the imaging findings do not suggest multiple myeloma.

Option B, Paget disease, is also unlikely as the patient does not have any symptoms or signs of Paget disease such as bone pain, deformity, or pathological fractures. Additionally, the imaging findings do not suggest Paget disease.

Option D, fibrous dysplasia, is not a likely diagnosis as it is a benign condition that affects the bone and does not explain the patient's symptoms of clear nasal discharge and CSF leak.

Therefore, the correct answer is C, intradiploic meningoencephalocele.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is C: Inquire about history of frequent infections and abnormal bleeding.

The patient's presentation of poor vision, photophobia, and hypopigmentation of the hair and eyes suggests a possible diagnosis of oculocutaneous albinism (OCA). This is a group of genetic disorders that affect the production or function of melanin, which is responsible for skin, hair, and eye pigmentation. OCA is associated with a higher risk of developing skin cancer, such as melanoma, and other complications.

Inquire about history of frequent infections and abnormal bleeding is the correct answer because individuals with OCA often have a weakened immune system, which can lead to recurrent infections, and they may also experience abnormal bleeding due to platelet dysfunction. Asking about these symptoms can help confirm the diagnosis and identify any potential complications.

Perform dilated ophthalmic examination (A) may also be appropriate, but it is not the most appropriate next step. A dilated examination can help evaluate the retina and detect any potential complications, but it is not specifically targeted towards diagnosing OCA.

Order molecular genetic testing (B) may also be appropriate, but it is not the most appropriate next step. Genetic testing can help confirm the diagnosis of OCA, but it is not necessary at this point in the evaluation.

Counsel to avoid sun exposure (D) is not the most appropriate next step. While it is important for individuals with OCA to protect their skin from the sun, this is not the most pressing concern at this point in the evaluation.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: Inquire about history of frequent infections and abnormal bleeding.

**Answer**: B. Biopsy the lesion

The correct answer is B. Biopsy the lesion because it is the most appropriate next step in the evaluation of this patient's condition.

A. Perform an incision and drainage: This option is not appropriate because there is no evidence of an abscess or fluid collection that needs to be drained. Additionally, incision and drainage may not provide a definitive diagnosis and may potentially worsen the condition.

C. Prescribe an anti-inflammatory agent: This option is not appropriate because there is no evidence of inflammation or swelling that needs to be treated with anti-inflammatory medication. Additionally, anti-inflammatory medication may not address the underlying cause of the nodule.

D. Perform a touch preparation: This option is not appropriate because it is not a diagnostic procedure that can provide a definitive diagnosis. A touch preparation may be used to assess for the presence of bacteria or other microorganisms, but it is not suitable for diagnosing a nodule.

Biopsy, on the other hand, can provide a definitive diagnosis by obtaining a tissue sample from the nodule and examining it under a microscope. This is particularly important in this case because the patient has a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and type 2 diabetes, which may increase the risk of various complications. Biopsy can help to rule out potential causes of the nodule, such as infection, inflammation, or cancer, and guide further management.

Therefore, the best next step in the evaluation of this patient's condition is to perform a biopsy of the nodule.

**Answer**: D. Leukemia cutis

The correct answer is D. Leukemia cutis because it is a condition that presents with skin lesions that are similar to the ones described in the case. Leukemia cutis is a type of cancer that affects the skin and is associated with hematologic malignancies, such as leukemia. The patient's history of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and juvenile xanthogranulomas increases the likelihood of this diagnosis. The patient's symptoms, including the development of fever and otitis media, also support this diagnosis.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Erythema annulare centrifugum is a condition that presents with annular, indurated plaques on the skin, but it is not associated with hematologic malignancies.

B. Interstitial granulomatous dermatitis is a condition that presents with skin lesions that are similar to the ones described in the case, but it is not associated with hematologic malignancies.

C. Granuloma annulare is a condition that presents with annular, indurated plaques on the skin, but it is not associated with hematologic malignancies.

**Answer**: C. Hydroxyurea-induced dermatomyositis-like eruption

The correct answer is C. Hydroxyurea-induced dermatomyositis-like eruption because the patient's symptoms and clinical findings are consistent with this diagnosis.

The patient's violaceous, reticulated plaques on the dorsal aspects of her hands and forearms, as well as the scaly, violaceous plaques on her thenar and radial aspects of her fingers, are consistent with the cutaneous manifestations of dermatomyositis. Additionally, the patient's history of essential thrombocytosis and treatment with hydroxyurea suggest a possible drug-induced etiology for the dermatomyositis-like eruption.

The other answer choices do not fit the patient's symptoms and clinical findings as well.

A. Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is a possibility, but the patient's lack of associated constitutional symptoms, such as fever, weakness, and myalgias, and the absence of characteristic histopathological features of CLE, such as interface dermatitis and apoptotic keratinocytes, make it less likely.

B. Cutaneous microvascular occlusion secondary to essential thrombocytosis is also a possibility, but the patient's lack of other signs of microvascular occlusion, such as livedo reticularis or digital ulcers, and the absence of evidence of platelet aggregation or thrombosis on histopathology, make it less likely.

D. Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a possibility, but the patient's lack of systemic symptoms, such as fever, weight loss, and myalgias, and the absence of characteristic histopathological features of PAN, such as inflammation and necrosis of the small blood vessels, make it less likely.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and clinical findings, the most likely diagnosis is C. Hydroxyurea-induced dermatomyositis-like eruption.

**Answer**: D. Sneddon syndrome

The patient's symptoms and findings, including ataxia, left-sided hemidysesthesia, and annular patches of violaceous erythema forming an irregular net-like pattern on her trunk and extremities, are consistent with Sneddon syndrome. This is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies, which can cause stroke, skin lesions, and other neurological symptoms. The patient's history of multiple strokes and Raynaud syndrome also supports this diagnosis.

A. Cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita (van Lohuizen syndrome) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by cutaneous telangiectasias and marmorated skin. While the patient's skin lesions may resemble those seen in van Lohuizen syndrome, the presence of ataxia, hemidysesthesia, and stroke history suggests a different diagnosis.

B. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that can cause a variety of symptoms, including skin rashes, arthritis, and neurological manifestations. However, the patient's negative antiphospholipid antibody and lupus anticoagulant screening results, as well as the absence of other SLE manifestations, make SLE less likely.

C. Ataxia-telangiectasia (Louis-Bar syndrome) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasia, and immunodeficiency. While the patient's ataxia and skin lesions may resemble those seen in Louis-Bar syndrome, the absence of other characteristic features, such as oculocutaneous telangiectasia and immunodeficiency, makes this diagnosis less likely.

Therefore, D. Sneddon syndrome is the most appropriate diagnosis for this patient's symptoms and findings.

**Answer**:C. Autoimmune encephalitis

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of recurrent dysarthria and ataxia, along with the MRI findings of T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery changes with associated patchy enhancement in the brainstem and left parietotemporal region, suggest a diagnosis of autoimmune encephalitis. The patient's history of previous episodes of demyelinating syndrome and response to corticosteroid therapy also support this diagnosis.

Autoimmune encephalitis is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the brain, leading to inflammation and damage to brain tissue. It can cause a range of symptoms including confusion, seizures, and changes in speech and movement, as well as abnormalities on MRI.

The other options are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and MRI findings. Multiple sclerosis (choice A) is a chronic demyelinating disease that affects the central nervous system, but it typically presents with symptoms such as vision loss, weakness, and sensory changes, rather than dysarthria and ataxia. Central nervous system lymphoma (choice B) is a type of cancer that affects the brain and spinal cord, but it typically presents with symptoms such as headache, seizures, and changes in mental status, rather than the focal symptoms and MRI findings described in this case. Neurosarcoidosis (choice D) is a rare inflammatory disease that affects the central nervous system, but it typically presents with symptoms such as vision loss, cranial nerve palsies, and meningismus, rather than the symptoms described in this case.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain why C. Angiokeratoma is the correct answer and why the other choices are incorrect.

**Answer**: C. Angiokeratoma

The correct answer is C. Angiokeratoma because it matches the patient's symptoms and clinical appearance. Angiokeratoma is a benign skin condition characterized by the presence of small, dilated blood vessels in the skin, which can cause redness, telangiectasia, and papules. The patient's changing skin lesion, with the appearance of new black spots within a stable red lesion, is consistent with the evolution of an angiokeratoma. The patient's family history of dysplastic nevus syndrome and melanoma increases the likelihood of this diagnosis.

Now, let's discuss why the other choices are incorrect:

A. Congenital nevus: A congenital nevus is a benign growth that is present at birth or appears within the first few months of life. While it can have a similar appearance to angiokeratoma, it is usually larger and more raised, and does not have the same telangiectatic appearance. The patient's lesion has been present since he was 7 years old, which makes it less likely to be a congenital nevus.

B. Melanoma: Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that can appear as a changing mole or lesion. However, the patient's lesion does not have the characteristics of melanoma, such as irregular borders, asymmetry, or a darker color. The patient's family history of melanoma increases the importance of monitoring the lesion, but it is not the most likely diagnosis based on the clinical appearance.

D. Mastocytoma: Mastocytoma is a benign growth of mast cells, which can cause skin lesions. However, mastocytoma typically appears as a solitary, well-circumscribed nodule or plaque, rather than a cluster of papules or vesicles. The patient's lesion does not have the characteristic appearance of mastocytoma.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and clinical appearance, the most likely diagnosis is C. Angiokeratoma.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

**Answer**: C. Carcinoma

The correct answer is C. Carcinoma because it is a malignant tumor that originates from the epithelial cells lining the ducts or lobules of the breast. The patient's symptoms of a slowly enlarging mass with associated pain, as well as the physical examination findings of a hard, irregular, mobile nodule in the retroareolar area of the right breast that is tethered to the overlying skin but not fixed to the underlying muscle, are consistent with a breast carcinoma. The patient's age and lack of family history of breast or ovarian cancer also support this diagnosis.

In contrast, A. Gynecomastia is a condition characterized by the abnormal growth of breast tissue in males, typically due to an imbalance of hormones. While gynecomastia can cause breast enlargement, it is usually not associated with a distinct mass or pain.

B. Lipoma is a benign tumor composed of fat cells, which can occur anywhere in the body, including the breast. However, lipomas are usually soft and movable, and do not cause pain.

D. Epidermal inclusion cyst is a benign growth that occurs when skin cells become trapped in a hair follicle or sweat gland. While it can cause a mass, it is usually small and not associated with pain.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, as well as the diagnostic images provided, the most likely diagnosis is C. Carcinoma.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

**Answer**: C. Mesenteric venous thrombosis

The patient's symptoms of progressively worsening diffuse abdominal pain, distension, nausea, and nonbilious emesis, along with the physical examination findings of a lethargic patient with a distended abdomen, diffuse rebound tenderness, and involuntary guarding, suggest a possible small bowel obstruction or ischemia. The laboratory values, particularly the low sodium concentration and elevated lactate concentration, support this diagnosis.

The computed tomography (CT) scan findings of diffuse free fluid, dilated small bowel loops with thickened, hypoenhancing bowel walls, and marked edema of the mesentery are consistent with mesenteric venous thrombosis (MVT). MVT is a rare cause of small bowel ischemia that occurs when a blood clot forms in the mesenteric vein, which drains blood from the intestines. This can lead to a decrease in blood flow to the small intestine, causing ischemia and inflammation.

The other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and CT scan findings.

A. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD): While IBD can cause abdominal pain and distension, the patient's symptoms of progressively worsening pain and the CT scan findings of diffuse free fluid and thickened, hypoenhancing bowel walls are not typical of IBD. Additionally, the patient had no prior history of abdominal surgery or IBD.

B. Small-bowel neoplasm: While small-bowel neoplasms can cause abdominal pain and distension, the patient's symptoms and CT scan findings are not typical of a neoplasm. The patient's age and lack of prior abdominal history also make a neoplasm less likely.

D. Superior mesenteric artery thromboembolism: While superior mesenteric artery thromboembolism can cause small bowel ischemia, the patient's CT scan findings of diff

**Answer**:D. Conduct endoscopic nasal exploration and marsupialization

Explanation:
The correct answer is D. Conduct endoscopic nasal exploration and marsupialization, because the patient's symptoms of acute dacryocystitis with overlying preseptal cellulitis and an intranasal cystic mass suggest a possible nasolacrimal duct obstruction. Endoscopic nasal exploration and marsupialization can help to confirm the diagnosis and provide a definitive treatment.

Option A, transitioning to oral antibiotics and discharge, is not appropriate at this stage, as the patient's symptoms have not fully resolved, and there is still a risk of complications such as orbital cellulitis or meningitis.

Option B, probing with silicone intubation of the lacrimal drainage system, may be necessary later in the management of the case, but it is not the most appropriate next step.

Option C, performing lacrimal sac digital massage, is not a recommended procedure for acute dacryocystitis and may potentially worsen the condition.

Therefore, the best next step would be to conduct endoscopic nasal exploration and marsupialization to further evaluate and manage the patient's condition.

**Answer**: D. Measure the patient’s blood pressure

Explanation:

A. Order a lumbar puncture:
This choice is incorrect because while a lumbar puncture may be necessary to diagnose conditions such as meningitis or encephalitis, it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a possible diagnosis of a neurological disorder, but the diffuse abnormalities on the T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences of the MRI brain scan suggest a broader systemic disorder that may not be related to the central nervous system. Therefore, measuring the patient's blood pressure is a more appropriate next step to assess for possible systemic hypertension or other vascular abnormalities that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms.

B. Prescribe corticosteroids and consult rheumatology:
This choice is incorrect because while corticosteroids may be used to treat certain neurological disorders, such as optic neuritis or multiple sclerosis, there is no indication for their use in this case based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings. Additionally, consulting rheumatology may not be necessary at this point in the patient's evaluation, as the patient does not have any obvious musculoskeletal symptoms or signs of rheumatological disease.

C. Prescribe azithromycin:
This choice is incorrect because there is no indication for antibiotics in this case. The patient's symptoms and examination findings do not suggest an infectious etiology, and azithromycin would not be effective in treating the patient's underlying condition.

D. Measure the patient’s blood pressure:
This choice is correct because it is an appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a possible systemic disorder, and measuring the patient's blood pressure can help assess for hypertension or other vascular abnormalities that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. Additionally, measuring the patient's blood pressure is a non-invasive and quick test that can provide valuable

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is C. Order brain neuroimaging and lumbar puncture.

The patient's symptoms of blurry vision, optic nerve pallor, and mildly dilated and tortuous veins, along with a history of acute lymphocytic leukemia and recent Bell's palsy, suggest a possible diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis. This is a serious condition that requires prompt evaluation and treatment to prevent further damage.

Option C, ordering brain neuroimaging and lumbar puncture, is the appropriate next step in evaluating the patient's symptoms. Imaging studies, such as MRI or CT scans, can help to identify any inflammation or abnormalities in the brain and its vessels, while a lumbar puncture can help to confirm the diagnosis of CNS vasculitis by analyzing the cerebrospinal fluid for inflammatory cells and other markers.

Option A, asking the patient to taper the oral prednisone and reassuring her that the symptoms will gradually resolve, is not the appropriate next step. While prednisone may be used to treat CNS vasculitis, it is not the first-line treatment and should only be initiated after a definitive diagnosis has been made.

Option B, administering intravitreal injection of an anti–vascular endothelial growth factor agent, may be considered for the treatment of retinal vascular diseases, but it is not the appropriate next step in this case, as the patient's symptoms are not primarily related to retinal vascular disease.

Option D, ordering an infectious and inflammatory workup, may be considered in the evaluation of CNS vasculitis, but it is not the most appropriate next step. While infections and inflammation can cause CNS vasculitis, the patient's history and symptoms do not suggest a likely infectious etiology, and a workup for infection may not provide the necessary information to make a definitive diagnosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Order brain neuroimaging and lumbar puncture.

**Answer**:B. Perform echocardiography and administer intravenous immunoglobulin

The correct answer is B because the patient's symptoms of bilateral eyelid edema, erythema, and shallow ulceration, along with the presence of pyuria and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, suggest a diagnosis of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, a severe allergic reaction that can cause skin and mucous membrane lesions. The patient's age and the rapid progression of symptoms also support this diagnosis.

Performing echocardiography and administering intravenous immunoglobulin are appropriate steps in managing Stevens-Johnson syndrome, as they can help to identify and treat any associated cardiac complications, such as myocarditis or pericarditis, and reduce the risk of further complications.

In contrast, starting corticosteroid eyedrops and checking daily for pseudomembrane formation (choice A) may not be effective in treating the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and may even worsen the condition. Performing a Tzanck smear on a swab from an ulcerated lesion (choice C) may help to diagnose herpes simplex virus or other viral infections, but it is not the most appropriate step in managing Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Institute contact precautions and prescribing mupirocin ointment to the eyelid skin (choice D) may help to prevent the spread of infection, but it is not the most urgent or effective step in treating the patient's condition.

**Answer**:B. Spontaneous perinephric hematoma

The patient's symptoms of acute, severe left flank pain, hypotension, conjunctival pallor, and left renal angle tenderness, along with the laboratory findings of low hemoglobin, acute-onset thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis, are consistent with a bleeding diathesis. The patient's history of mantle cell lymphoma and recent switch to ibrutinib therapy increases the likelihood of a bleeding complication.

A. Abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture is unlikely given the patient's age and lack of symptoms suggestive of a ruptured aneurysm, such as sudden severe back or abdominal pain, hypotension, or signs of shock.

C. Splenic rupture is less likely given the absence of left upper quadrant pain or tenderness, which is typically seen in splenic injuries.

D. Pyelonephritis is unlikely given the absence of symptoms such as fever, chills, or flank pain, and the lack of urinary tract infection or bacteriuria on urinalysis.

B. Spontaneous perinephric hematoma is the most likely diagnosis, as it can present with acute flank pain, hypotension, and low hemoglobin, and can be associated with bleeding diathesis due to ibrutinib therapy. The patient's recent switch to ibrutinib and the absence of other likely causes of bleeding support this diagnosis. The CT scan findings of a large perinephric hematoma surrounding the left kidney are also consistent with this diagnosis.

**Answer**: C. Treat with full-dose anticoagulation

The patient in this case has been diagnosed with stage IV lung adenocarcinoma with metastases to the brain, lung, and mitral valve. The presence of multiple pulmonary nodules, vertebral metastases, and small bilateral subsegmental pulmonary emboli suggests a high risk of further embolic events. Additionally, the patient has a history of dyspnea and weakness, which could be indicative of a pulmonary embolism.

Given these findings, the most appropriate next step would be to treat the patient with full-dose anticoagulation to prevent further embolic events. This is supported by the CHEST guidelines, which recommend anticoagulation therapy for patients with cancer and acute pulmonary embolism.

In contrast, initiating broad-spectrum antibiotics (choice A) may be appropriate for a patient with a bacterial infection, but it would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, which is the pulmonary embolism.

Referring for surgical valve replacement (choice B) may be necessary in the future, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this time. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a high risk of embolic events, which need to be urgently addressed with anticoagulation therapy.

Initiating chemotherapy (choice D) may also be appropriate for this patient, but it would not address the immediate risk of embolic events. Chemotherapy is typically used to treat cancer, but it can take time to be effective, and it may not prevent embolic events in the short term.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Treat with full-dose anticoagulation.

**Answer**:A. Biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma

The correct answer is A, Biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma, because it best matches the patient's symptoms and the histopathological findings described in the case.

A biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma is a rare type of cancer that arises in the nasal cavity and exhibits both mesenchymal and epithelial characteristics. The patient's symptoms of a 7-month history of right-sided nasal obstruction, constant nasal pressure, and a soft-tissue mass emanating from the right middle meatus inferior to the middle turbinate, are consistent with this diagnosis.

The histopathological findings also support this diagnosis. The tumor cells are positive for S-100 and actin, which are markers commonly expressed in sarcomas, and negative for GFAP, CD34, and cytokeratin, which are markers expressed in other types of tumors. Additionally, the tumor cells are negative for SOX-10 and B-catenin, which are markers expressed in other types of sarcomas.

Solitary fibrous tumor (choice B) is a benign tumor that typically arises in the soft tissues of the head and neck, but it can also occur in the nasal cavity. However, it typically does not have the same histopathological features as biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (choice C) is a type of sarcoma that arises from the peripheral nerves, but it typically does not have the same histopathological features as biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma.

Synovial sarcoma (choice D) is a type of sarcoma that arises in the synovial tissue of joints, but it typically does not have the same histopathological features as biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and the histopathological findings, the most likely diagnosis is biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma.

**Answer**: B. Infectious pseudotumor

The correct answer is B. Infectious pseudotumor because the patient's symptoms and test results suggest an infection rather than a neoplastic process. The patient's history of asthma, chronic otitis media with effusion, and obstructive sleep apnea, as well as the presence of a tender and firm parotid mass, are consistent with an infectious process. The fact that the mass was shaved off the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve also suggests that it was not a benign or malignant neoplasm.

The patient's fine-needle aspirate (FNA) yielded a cellular sample with spindloid features, which could be consistent with a neoplasm of uncertain subtype, but the presence of confluent granulomata with Langhans-type giant cells and central necrosis on permanent histopathologic images supports the diagnosis of infectious pseudotumor.

Infectious pseudotumor is a rare condition that can mimic a neoplastic process, but it is caused by an infection that triggers a granulomatous response. It is often associated with chronic infections, such as tuberculosis, and can affect various organs, including the parotid gland.

The other answer choices are less likely because:

A. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a type of salivary gland cancer that typically affects the parotid gland, but it is not associated with a granulomatous response.

C. Histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis, also known as Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease, is a rare condition that affects the lymph nodes, but it is not typically associated with a parotid mass.

**Answer**: B. Subglottic cyst

The patient's symptoms of worsening respiratory distress, noisy breathing, and stridor are consistent with a subglottic cyst. The patient's history of prematurity and intubation during a neonatal intensive care unit stay also increase the likelihood of a subglottic cyst. The physical examination findings of biphasic stridor and a weak cry also support this diagnosis. The capnography waveform shown in Figure A demonstrates a restrictive "shark fin" waveform, which is consistent with a subglottic cyst.

The direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy images shown in Figures C and D demonstrate a subglottic cyst. The cyst is visible as a rounded mass in the subglottic region, and it appears to be obstructing the airflow.

The other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and findings. Laryngotracheitis (croup) would not explain the patient's history of prematurity and intubation, and the physical examination findings do not support this diagnosis. Subglottic stenosis would not explain the patient's noisy breathing and stridor, and the images do not show any evidence of stenosis. Subglottic hemangioma is a rare condition and would not explain the patient's symptoms or physical examination findings.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Subglottic cyst.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain why B. Cutaneous malakoplakia is the correct answer and why the other choices are incorrect.

**Answer**: B. Cutaneous malakoplakia

Cutaneous malakoplakia is a rare inflammatory condition that affects the skin and subcutaneous tissue. It is characterized by the accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages, which can cause the formation of nodules or plaques on the skin. The condition is often associated with other diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, and autoimmune disorders.

In this case, the patient's symptoms of bright red, burning, and painful nodules around his scrotum, as well as the presence of symmetrical solitary erythematous nodules in the right and left inguinal folds adjacent to the scrotum, are consistent with cutaneous malakoplakia. The patient's history of intertrigo, which is a common condition that causes redness and itching of the skin in the groin area, may have contributed to the development of cutaneous malakoplakia.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Deep fungal infection: While fungal infections can cause skin lesions, they typically do not present with the same symptoms as cutaneous malakoplakia. Fungal infections are more likely to cause itching, scaling, and crusting of the skin, rather than burning and pain. Additionally, fungal infections are usually accompanied by other signs of infection, such as fever, chills, and swollen lymph nodes, which are not mentioned in the patient's history.

C. Granular cell tumor: Granular cell tumors are benign growths that can occur in various parts of the body, including the skin. However, they are typically slow-growing and painless, and do not cause the same symptoms as cutaneous malakoplakia. Granular cell tumors are also usually solitary, whereas the patient in this case has multiple nodules.

**Answer**: C. Secondary syphilis

The patient's symptoms, such as the presence of annular red plaques with scale and superficial erosions on the trunk and extremities, and the corymbiform pattern of lesions on both arms, are consistent with the characteristic skin manifestations of secondary syphilis. The involvement of the palms and soles, as well as the absence of regional lymph node enlargement or systemic involvement, also support this diagnosis.

Psoriasis (A) is a chronic skin condition characterized by thick, scaly, red plaques, but it typically does not have the same annular and corymbiform pattern as seen in secondary syphilis. Additionally, psoriasis typically affects the extensor surfaces of the body, such as the elbows and knees, rather than the trunk and extremities.

Lupus erythematosus (B) is a chronic autoimmune disease that can cause skin lesions, but it typically presents with more widespread and variably-sized lesions, and may also involve the face, scalp, and mucous membranes.

T-cell lymphoma (D) is a type of cancer that affects the immune system, but it typically presents with more widespread and aggressive skin lesions, and may also involve lymph nodes and other organs.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is secondary syphilis.

**Answer**: B. Subcutaneous sarcoidosis

The correct answer is B. Subcutaneous sarcoidosis because it best matches the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

Sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects various organs, including the skin, lungs, and lymph nodes. Subcutaneous sarcoidosis is a rare form of the disease that presents with nodules or plaques in the subcutaneous tissue. The patient's symptoms of enlarging, non-painful upper extremity nodules developing over the preceding 9 months, as well as the pathological fracture of his right foot, are consistent with subcutaneous sarcoidosis.

The patient's laboratory results also support this diagnosis. His elevated calcium levels and positive histopathology results, which show pale, nodular aggregations of inflammatory cells in the deep dermis and fibrotic subcutis, are consistent with sarcoidosis. Additionally, the patient's negative purified protein derivative and quantiferon test results rule out other potential causes of his symptoms, such as tuberculosis.

The other answer choices do not fit the patient's symptoms and laboratory results as well.

A. Sporotrichosis is a fungal infection that presents with nodules or ulcers on the skin, usually after a scratch or puncture wound. While the patient's nodules are consistent with this diagnosis, the absence of any recent travel or aquarium exposure, as well as the negative fungal culture and acid-fast bacilli results, make it less likely.

C. Tumoral calcinosis is a rare condition characterized by the accumulation of calcium salts in the soft tissues, leading to the formation of nodules or masses. While the patient's elevated calcium levels and pathological fracture are consistent with this diagnosis, the absence of any other symptoms or signs of hyperparathyroidism, as well as the negative Fite stain for mycobacterial organisms, make it less likely.

**Answer**: B. Vitamin A deficiency

The correct answer is B. Vitamin A deficiency because the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's progressive vision loss, night blindness, and light sensitivity are all classic symptoms of vitamin A deficiency. The dry, keratinized patches on the conjunctiva (Bitot spots) and the corneal epitheliopathy with opacity are also characteristic findings of vitamin A deficiency.

The patient's restrictive diet, which consists solely of potato, pork, lamb, apples, cucumber, and Cheerios, is likely deficient in vitamin A. Vitamin A is an essential nutrient that is important for maintaining healthy vision, and a diet that is lacking in vitamin A can lead to deficiency.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Glaucoma: While glaucoma can cause vision loss, it is typically associated with increased intraocular pressure and is not characterized by dry, keratinized patches on the conjunctiva or corneal epitheliopathy.

C. Sjögren syndrome: Sjögren syndrome is an autoimmune disorder that can cause dry eyes and mouth, but it is not typically associated with vision loss or corneal epitheliopathy.

D. Bilateral cataracts: Bilateral cataracts can cause vision loss, but they are typically associated with clouding of the lens, not dry, keratinized patches on the conjunctiva or corneal epitheliopathy.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is vitamin A deficiency.

**Answer**: B. Acute appendicitis

The patient's symptoms of worsening right lower quadrant tenderness and fullness, associated with diarrhea, vomiting, fevers, and chills, are consistent with acute appendicitis. The patient's history of relief of symptoms with loperamide, which is an antidiarrheal medication, suggests that the appendix is likely inflamed and causing symptoms. The patient's lack of significant medical history, including no history of weight loss, melena, or hematochezia, also supports this diagnosis.

The CT scan result showing a large right-sided inflammatory phlegmon measuring 7.5 cm in transverse diameter is also consistent with acute appendicitis. Inflammatory phlegmon is a common finding in acute appendicitis and indicates inflammation of the appendix.

In contrast, the other answer choices do not fit the patient's symptoms and CT scan result as well.

A. Desmoid tumor: Desmoid tumors are rare, benign growths that can occur in the abdominal wall. They are usually slow-growing and do not cause symptoms similar to acute appendicitis.

C. Lymphoma: Lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the immune system. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including abdominal pain, but the patient's symptoms and CT scan result do not suggest lymphoma.

D. Carcinoid tumor: Carcinoid tumors are rare, slow-growing tumors that can occur in the digestive system. They can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and flushing, but the patient's symptoms and CT scan result do not suggest a carcinoid tumor.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and CT scan result, the most likely diagnosis is acute appendicitis.

**Answer**: C. Lupus enteritis

The correct answer is C. Lupus enteritis because it aligns with the patient's history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and the symptoms described. Lupus enteritis is a rare complication of SLE that occurs when the immune system attacks the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, leading to inflammation and damage to the GI mucosa.

The patient's symptoms of progressively worsening abdominal pain, diarrhea, and distended abdomen are consistent with lupus enteritis. The absence of fevers, chills, or diaphoresis also supports this diagnosis, as lupus enteritis typically does not present with these symptoms.

The laboratory test findings, which were normal, also support the diagnosis of lupus enteritis, as laboratory tests are often normal in patients with this condition.

The abdominal CT scan and CT angiogram findings also support the diagnosis of lupus enteritis. The coronal view of the CT scan from 3 days prior to readmission showed isolated duodenal thickening, which is consistent with lupus enteritis. The coronal view of the CT angiography scan on readmission showed thickened small bowel and free fluid, which is also consistent with lupus enteritis.

In contrast, the other answer choices do not align with the patient's history and symptoms:

A. Mesenteric ischemia: This occurs when there is a reduction in blood flow to the small intestine, leading to abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. While the patient did present with abdominal pain, the absence of other symptoms and the lack of any history of cardiovascular disease make this diagnosis less likely.

B. Superior mesenteric venous thrombosis: This occurs when a blood clot forms in the superior mesenteric vein, which drains blood from the small intestine. This can cause abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. However, the patient's history of SLE and the absence of

**Answer**:C. Counsel the patient on the prognosis of his condition

The patient in the scenario has experienced profound vision loss after a traumatic work injury. The fundus photographs of the posterior pole in each eye show diffuse pallor of the optic discs, indicating damage to the optic nerves. The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with bilateral optic neuropathy.

Option A, testing the patient with an optokinetic nystagmus drum, is not relevant to the patient's condition and would not provide useful information for diagnosis or treatment.

Option B, repeating magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, may be considered to rule out any other intracranial causes of vision loss, but it is unlikely to provide new information in this case, given the patient's history and physical examination findings.

Option D, testing pupils with dilute pilocarpine, is also not relevant to the patient's condition and would not provide useful information for diagnosis or treatment.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C, counseling the patient on the prognosis of his condition. The patient should be informed that bilateral optic neuropathy is a serious condition that can result in permanent vision loss. The prognosis for recovery of vision is generally poor, especially in cases where there is evidence of optic nerve damage. However, the patient should also be informed that there are treatment options available, such as corticosteroids, that may help improve vision in some cases. It is important for the patient to understand the potential outcomes and to be prepared for the possibility of long-term vision loss.

**Answer**:C. Order contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the brain

The patient's symptoms of numbness on the right side of the forehead and cheek, as well as the severe ocular discomfort, are indicative of a possible neurological issue. The fact that the patient's symptoms did not improve after being diagnosed with blepharitis and prescribed antibiotics suggests that there may be a more underlying condition that needs to be addressed.

Option C, ordering contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, is the best course of action because it allows for a thorough examination of the brain and its surrounding structures. This imaging technique can help identify any potential issues with the brain, such as a tumor, aneurysm, or stroke, that may be causing the patient's symptoms.

Option A, ordering computed tomography of the brain with angiography, may also be useful in identifying any structural abnormalities in the brain, but it does not provide the same level of detail as MRI, particularly in regards to soft tissue and blood vessels.

Option B, prescribing analgesia to treat atypical trigeminal neuralgia and referring the patient to a neurologist, may help manage the patient's pain symptoms, but it does not address the underlying cause of the symptoms.

Option D, continuing treatment for blepharitis, is not the best option as the patient's symptoms have not improved with previous treatment and it is unlikely that continuing the same treatment will resolve the issue.

D. Discuss carefully observing vs surgical repair of the ptosis is the correct answer because it is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's unilateral congenital ptosis. The patient's history of twitching of the left eye during feeding and mealtimes since infancy, along with the observed asymmetry in eyelid measurements and the presence of a unilateral ptosis, suggests that the ptosis may be caused by a neurological disorder such as Marcus Gunn jaw-winking syndrome.

In this case, it is important to carefully observe the patient's condition and consider the possibility of a neurological disorder before deciding on surgical repair of the ptosis. Surgical repair may not be necessary if the ptosis is caused by a neurological disorder, and it may not address the underlying cause of the condition.

Option A, conducting genetic testing, may be appropriate in some cases of congenital ptosis, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case given the patient's history and physical examination findings.

Option B, performing urgent neuroimaging, may be necessary if the patient had symptoms such as headaches, vomiting, or diplopia, or if there were signs of a more serious neurological disorder such as a large ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, or anisocoria. However, in this case, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest a more serious neurological disorder, and urgent neuroimaging is not necessary.

Option C, starting oral corticosteroids, is not appropriate in this case as there is no evidence of inflammation or an inflammatory disorder causing the ptosis.

**Answer**: Adenocarcinoma consistent with metastatic breast carcinoma

The correct answer is Adenocarcinoma consistent with metastatic breast carcinoma because it aligns with the clinical presentation and imaging findings described in the case.

The patient's symptoms of blurred vision, drooping of the left upper eyelid, and binocular diplopia, along with the physical examination findings of mild proptosis and severely limited adduction of the left eye, suggest a possible orbital mass. The MRI scan confirms the presence of a 2.3-cm intraconal mass that is inseparable from the left lateral rectus muscle and medially deviates the left optic nerve. These findings are consistent with a metastatic lesion to the orbit.

The patient's history of breast cancer, which was diagnosed and treated with lumpectomy and radiotherapy in 2000, increases the likelihood that the orbital mass is a metastasis from the breast cancer. The fact that the mass is conforming to the shape of the orbital globe and causing mild bony remodeling of the lateral orbital wall further supports this diagnosis.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to perform an excisional biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of metastatic breast carcinoma. This is option A, which is the correct answer.

In contrast, option B, Begin chemotherapy, may be appropriate at a later stage if the diagnosis is confirmed, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this point.

Option C, Incisional biopsy, may also be appropriate, but it is not as invasive as excisional biopsy and may not provide a definitive diagnosis.

Option D, Begin corticosteroid treatment, may be appropriate to reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms, but it is not the most appropriate next step in establishing a definitive diagnosis.

I hope this explanation helps clarify the reasoning behind the correct answer.

The correct answer is D. Therapeutic monoclonal antibody at serum concentration detectable by SPEP-IF.

The patient in the case study was diagnosed with multiple myeloma and was treated with VRD-E therapy, which includes the monoclonal antibody elotuzumab. The patient's serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and immunofixation (IF) results showed a monoclonal IgA κ at 0.3 g/dL and a serum free κ/λ ratio skewed at 257. After three weeks of therapy, the patient's SPEP-IF demonstrated a new M-IgG κ band in the same electrophoretic position as the M-IgA κ, with the two distinguishable only by IF and measured at 0.1 g/dL. Over the next 8 months, the patient received maintenance therapy with VRD-E, and monthly SPEP-IF consistently showed M-IgG κ at 0.1 g/dL, with the original M-IgA κ consistently not detected.

The correct answer, D. Therapeutic monoclonal antibody at serum concentration detectable by SPEP-IF, is the best explanation for the appearance of the new M-IgG κ band in the patient's serum. The patient was receiving elotuzumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets SLAMF7, a cell surface protein expressed on myeloma cells. Elotuzumab can cause a response in myeloma cells by inducing apoptosis, inhibiting cell growth, and modulating the immune response. In this case, it is likely that the elotuzumab therapy led to the appearance of a new M-IgG κ band in the patient's serum, which was detectable by SPEP-IF.

The other answer choices are not correct for the following reasons:

**Answer**: D. Order cardiac fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) 

The patient's presentation of unheralded syncope, along with the findings of bradycardia, first-degree atrioventricular block, left posterior fascicle, and right bundle branch blocks on electrocardiography, suggests a possible diagnosis of a cardiac conduction disorder. Additionally, the patient's history of mild asthma increases the likelihood of an underlying cardiac condition.

Option A, invasive electrophysiologic testing, may be appropriate for evaluating the patient's cardiac conduction system, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a possible cardiac arrhythmia, and invasive electrophysiologic testing may not provide sufficient information to diagnose and manage the underlying condition.

Option B, coronary angiography, is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as the patient's symptoms and examination findings do not suggest coronary artery disease. While the patient's age and history of asthma increase the risk of coronary artery disease, the absence of any other symptoms or signs of coronary artery disease, such as chest pain or shortness of breath, makes coronary angiography less likely to provide useful information.

Option C, 30-day event monitoring, may be appropriate for evaluating the patient's cardiac rhythm over a longer period, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a possible cardiac arrhythmia, and 30-day event monitoring may not provide sufficient information to diagnose and manage the underlying condition.

Option D, cardiac fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), is the most appropriate next step in this case. FDG-PET is a non-invasive imaging modality that can provide information on the metabolic activity of the myocardium, which can help diagnose and manage cardiac conditions, such as cardiac arrhythmias. In this case, FDG-PET can help determine whether the patient

**Answer**:B. Discontinue antibiotic therapy and consider systemic corticosteroids

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of fever, new-onset pruritic, confluent, erythematous, blanching morbilliform macules and papules on the trunk and extremities, and diarrhea, weight gain, and negative respiratory viral cultures suggest a diagnosis of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of the skin and gut. Acute GVHD typically occurs within the first 100 days after transplant and is associated with a higher risk of mortality.

Option A, initiating empirical antiviral and antifungal therapy, may not be effective in treating acute GVHD and may cause unnecessary toxicity. The patient's negative viral cultures suggest that infection is less likely, and antiviral therapy may not be beneficial.

Option C, obtaining ferritin and soluble IL2Rα testing, may be useful in diagnosing and monitoring acute GVHD, but it is not the most appropriate next step. Ferritin and soluble IL2Rα levels are often elevated in acute GVHD, but they are not specific to this diagnosis and may be elevated in other conditions.

Option D, performing bronchoscopy and biopsy of the pulmonary lesions, may be necessary to diagnose and manage pulmonary complications, but it is not the most appropriate next step for the patient's skin and gut symptoms.

Therefore, the correct answer is option B, discontinuing antibiotic therapy and considering systemic corticosteroids. Discontinuing antibiotics may help to avoid unnecessary toxicity and prevent the development of antibiotic resistance. Systemic corticosteroids, such as prednisone, are a common treatment for acute GVHD and can help to reduce inflammation and prevent further organ damage.

**Answer**: B. Scrotal ulceration secondary to induction chemotherapy with ATRA

The correct answer is B, Scrotal ulceration secondary to induction chemotherapy with ATRA, because the patient's symptoms and clinical findings are consistent with this diagnosis.

The patient presented with spontaneous bruising, epistaxis, and haematuria, which are all symptoms consistent with acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML). The patient was diagnosed with APML by bone marrow aspirate morphology, immunophenotyping, and detection of the bcr1 variant of the PML-RARα fusion transcript in peripheral blood. The patient was started on treatment with the PETHEMA LPA 20051 protocol, which consists of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and idarubicin, an anthracycline-based chemotherapy.

After 12 days of treatment, the patient developed pyrexia and was started on empiric antibiotics. Two days later, the patient developed tender black spots on the scrotum that progressed to painful ulcers over 8 days. Systemic antifungal and antiviral therapy were added with no improvement. Peripheral blood cultures and skin swabs from the lesions did not identify bacterial or viral infection. Scrotal ultrasonography showed a subcutaneous hypervascular lesion with no abscess.

The development and progression of scrotal ulceration coincided with recovery in neutrophil count from 0.3 × 109/L to 1.2 × 109/L and persistent pyrexia. As scrotal ulceration progressed, they enlarged and became necrotic with a black eschar. A specimen was obtained for histopathology, which showed scrotal ulceration secondary to induction chemotherapy with ATRA.

The patient's scrotal ulceration was likely caused by the ATRA therapy, which is known to cause skin and mucous membrane toxicity. The patient's neutropenia and persistent pyrex

**Answer**:B. Malignant atrophic papulosis

The patient's symptoms and test results indicate that she has malignant atrophic papulosis. The patient has a history of unintentional weight loss, abdominal pain, and occasional vomiting, which are all symptoms of this condition. The patient's skin eruption, characterized by numerous 5- to 10-mm nontender papules with a porcelain-white atrophic center and an erythematous halo, as well as scattered atrophic white scars, is consistent with the characteristic skin lesions of malignant atrophic papulosis. The patient's history of a previous episode of idiopathic bowel perforation three years prior and the absence of any other significant medical conditions further support this diagnosis.

Pancreatitis panniculitis, option A, is an inflammatory condition that affects the pancreas and can cause skin lesions. However, the patient's history and physical examination do not suggest pancreatitis.

Systemic lupus erythematosus, option C, is a connective tissue disorder that can cause skin lesions. However, the patient's history and physical examination do not suggest this diagnosis, and there is no evidence of systemic lupus erythematosus on biopsy.

Lymphomatoid papulosis, option D, is a rare condition characterized by the development of papules or nodules on the skin. However, the patient's history and physical examination do not suggest this diagnosis, and there is no evidence of lymphomatoid papulosis on biopsy.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination, and test results, the most likely diagnosis is malignant atrophic papulosis.

The correct answer is C. Anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid. This is based on the patient's history, physical examination, and histopathologic analysis.

A. Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune disease that causes blisters and sores on the skin and mucous membranes. The patient's history of polymyalgia and treatment with prednisolone suggests that this condition is unlikely. Additionally, the patient did not have mucosal involvement, which is a common feature of bullous pemphigoid.

B. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita is a rare autoimmune disease that causes blisters and sores on the skin and mucous membranes. The patient's age and lack of scar formation suggest that this condition is unlikely.

D. Linear IgA dermatosis is a rare autoimmune disease that causes blisters and sores on the skin. The patient's history and physical examination do not suggest this condition.

C. Anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid is an autoimmune disease that causes blisters and sores on the skin. The patient's history of polymyalgia and treatment with prednisolone, as well as the histopathologic analysis of a subepidermal bulla with inflammatory infiltrates of neutrophils, are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's lack of mucosal involvement and scar formation also support this diagnosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid.

**Answer**: C. Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS)

Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS) is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by recurrent fevers, urticaria, and arthralgias, which are the main symptoms described in the case. The syndrome is caused by mutations in the NLRP3 gene, which is involved in the inflammasome pathway. The hallmark of MWS is the presence of recurrent episodes of fever, often accompanied by urticaria, arthralgia, and conjunctivitis. The fevers are typically high and can last for several days, as described in the case. The presence of bilateral conjunctivitis, arthralgias, and irritability also supports the diagnosis of MWS.

In contrast, chronic urticaria (Option A) is a common condition characterized by recurrent hives and itching, but it is not typically associated with fevers or joint pain. Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (Option B) is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by recurrent episodes of fever, urticaria, and joint pain, but it is triggered by exposure to cold temperatures, which is not mentioned in the case. Neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disorder (Option D) is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by recurrent fevers, urticaria, and joint pain, but it typically has a neonatal onset and is associated with other systemic manifestations such as respiratory, gastrointestinal, and neurological symptoms, which are not mentioned in the case.

Therefore, based on the symptoms described in the case, Muckle-Wells syndrome (Option C) is the most likely diagnosis.

The correct answer is D. Brachial artery pseudoaneurysm.

A pseudoaneurysm is a collection of blood that forms outside the wall of a blood vessel, typically as a result of trauma or iatrogenic injury. In this case, the patient's attempt to insert a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) into the right basilic vein was unsuccessful, which may have caused trauma to the brachial artery, leading to the formation of a pseudoaneurysm.

The patient's symptoms of right upper extremity pain and swelling, as well as the physical examination findings of tense and tender swelling of the right upper extremity, are consistent with a brachial artery pseudoaneurysm. The absence of a radial pulse and the presence of biphasic Doppler arterial signals in the right radial and ulnar artery also support this diagnosis.

The ultrasonographic imaging findings of a 12.8 × 2.6-cm heterogeneous fluid collection with active color flow are consistent with a pseudoaneurysm. The location of the fluid collection in the upper arm is also consistent with a brachial artery pseudoaneurysm.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Extensive deep vein thrombosis of the upper extremity: While deep vein thrombosis (DVT) can cause arm swelling, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are not consistent with DVT. The patient's swelling is localized to the upper arm, whereas DVT typically causes swelling in the entire limb. Additionally, the ultrasonographic imaging findings do not support DVT.

B. Compartment syndrome resulting from infiltration of intravenous infusion therapy into the soft tissues of the upper extremity: Compartment syndrome is a surgical emergency that occurs when increased pressure within a closed compartment compromises blood flow and function. While infiltration of intravenous infusion therapy into the soft tissues can cause swelling, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are not consistent with compart

**Answer**: C. Rupture of a jejunal artery aneurysm

The correct answer is C. Rupture of a jejunal artery aneurysm because the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's upper abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting are typical symptoms of an intra-abdominal catastrophe, and the presence of free fluid in the upper abdomen on the CECT image suggests bleeding from a ruptured aneurysm. The patient's history of smoking and hypertension also increases the likelihood of an aneurysm.

The laboratory results also support this diagnosis. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, indicating an inflammatory response, and the serum amylase level is normal, which suggests that the pancreas is not the source of the bleeding. The serum triglyceride level is also elevated, which is consistent with the presence of a lipase-rich pancreatic fluid in the abdominal cavity.

The mesenteric angiography also supports this diagnosis, as it reveals an aneurysm in the jejunal artery.

In contrast, the other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

A. Hemorrhagic pancreatitis: While pancreatitis can cause abdominal pain and elevated serum amylase levels, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not suggest pancreatitis. The patient's serum amylase level is normal, and the CECT image does not show evidence of pancreatic inflammation.

B. Acute perforation of a bleeding peptic ulcer: While a bleeding peptic ulcer can cause abdominal pain and bleeding, the patient's history of smoking and hypertension makes it less likely that a peptic ulcer is the source of the bleeding. Additionally, the CECT image does not show evidence of a perforated ulcer.

The correct answer is C. Treat with oral corticosteroids.

The patient presented with acute-onset blurred vision and mild tenderness in his left eye, along with shallow anterior chamber and elevated intraocular pressure. The examination revealed a ring-shaped peripheral ciliochoroidal mass accompanied by shallow serous retinal detachment inferiorly. These findings suggest a possible inflammatory or tumorous process in the choroid, which can cause vision loss if left untreated.

Treating the patient with oral corticosteroids can help reduce inflammation and prevent further vision loss. Corticosteroids are commonly used to treat various ocular inflammatory conditions, including uveitis, scleritis, and choroiditis. They work by reducing the inflammation and swelling in the affected tissues, which can help improve vision and prevent complications.

Now, let's discuss why the other choices are incorrect:

A. Perform fine-needle aspiration biopsy: While fine-needle aspiration biopsy can be a useful diagnostic tool in certain cases, it may not be the best choice in this scenario. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a possible inflammatory or tumorous process in the choroid, which may not be accurately diagnosed by fine-needle aspiration biopsy alone. Additionally, the risk of complications from the procedure, such as bleeding or infection, may outweigh the potential benefits.

B. Perform plaque radiotherapy: Plaque radiotherapy is a treatment option for certain types of ocular tumors, but it may not be appropriate for this patient's condition. The patient's symptoms and examination findings do not suggest a tumor, and plaque radiotherapy may not be effective in treating inflammatory conditions.

D. Proceed with sclerotomies, ie, creation of scleral windows: Sclerotomies are small incisions made in the sclera to allow for drainage of fluid and reduction of pressure in the eye. While this procedure may be necessary in certain cases, it may not be the best choice for this patient.

**Answer**:C. Obtain blood sample to investigate for autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy 

The correct answer is C. Obtain blood sample to investigate for autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy, because the patient's symptoms of bilateral mydriasis, reduced pupillary response to light and accommodation, and progressive generalized autonomic dysfunction, including reduced food intake and weight loss, constipation, urinary retention, anhidrosis, xerostomia, and xerophthalmia, are consistent with autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy. This is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the autonomic nervous system, including the pupillary reflex. The patient's symptoms are consistent with the clinical presentation of autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy.

Option A, prescribing phototropic variofocal glasses, is not appropriate because the patient's symptoms are not related to a visual problem, but rather to a dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system.

Option B, starting pilocarpine eyedrops, is also not appropriate because pilocarpine is used to treat dry eyes, which is not the primary issue in this case.

Option D, recommending genetic testing, may be considered in the future if the patient's symptoms persist or worsen, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this time.

Therefore, the best next step would be to obtain a blood sample to investigate for autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy, which could help to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.

**Answer**:B. Obtain an ultrasonographic biomicroscopy.

Explanation:

A. Continue administering mitomycin C and schedule a follow-up visit in 6 to 8 weeks: This choice does not address the patient's current symptoms of pain and peaked pupil. It is important to investigate the cause of these symptoms before continuing with further treatment.

C. Biopsy the limbal area around 9:30: This choice may be necessary in the future, but it is not the most appropriate step at this time. The patient has already undergone multiple surgeries and has been given mitomycin C as adjuvant therapy. It is important to first determine the cause of the peaked pupil and pain before proceeding with another invasive procedure.

D. Delay mitomycin C therapy for a few weeks: This choice may be appropriate if the patient's symptoms are thought to be related to the mitomycin C therapy. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the therapy is causing the patient's current symptoms. It is important to investigate the cause of the symptoms before making any changes to the treatment plan.

B. Obtain an ultrasonographic biomicroscopy: This choice is the most appropriate step at this time. The patient's peaked pupil and pain suggest that there may be a problem with the eye's anterior segment. An ultrasonographic biomicroscopy can provide detailed images of the eye's anterior segment and help to identify any potential issues, such as a cataract or glaucoma. This information can then be used to guide further management of the patient's condition.

**Answer**:C. Reassure the patient that VF loss is due to congenitally anomalous optic nerves and recommend annual evaluation to monitor VF

The correct answer is C. Reassure the patient that VF loss is due to congenitally anomalous optic nerves and recommend annual evaluation to monitor VF.

The patient's bilateral visual field loss, as shown on automated Humphrey VF screening, is stable and not related to glaucoma, as the intraocular pressure is within the target range for moderate glaucoma. The patient's ocular history and fundus examination also do not suggest glaucoma.

The patient's visual acuities of 20/30 OD and 20/25 OS, which match the density of his cataracts, indicate that the visual field loss is not due to cataracts.

The patient's mild nuclear sclerosis in each eye and bilateral tilted optic nerves with peripapillary atrophy suggest that the visual field loss is due to congenitally anomalous optic nerves.

Therefore, option C is the correct answer, as it acknowledges the patient's condition and recommends regular monitoring to assess any potential changes in the visual field.

Option A, reassuring the patient that the visual field loss is due to remote ischemic optic neuropathy and considering daily aspirin, is incorrect as there is no evidence to support this diagnosis.

Option B, ordering an immediate magnetic resonance imaging study, is not necessary at this point, as the patient's stable visual field loss and normal neurological examination do not suggest a need for urgent imaging.

Option D, performing selective laser trabeculoplasty because the patient's intraocular pressure is above target for his moderate glaucoma, is incorrect as the patient's visual field loss is not related to glaucoma.

**Answer**:A. Order an emergent coronary angiogram and endomyocardial biopsy.

This is the correct answer because the patient's symptoms of chest pain and shortness of breath, along with the ECG and echocardiogram results, suggest a possible coronary event or rejection episode. An emergent coronary angiogram is necessary to evaluate the coronary arteries and identify any blockages or stenosis that may be causing the patient's symptoms. Additionally, an endomyocardial biopsy is necessary to assess for rejection and to determine the cause of the patient's symptoms.

**Answer**:B. Check cytomegalovirus viral load.

This answer is incorrect because while cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is a common complication after heart transplantation, the patient's symptoms and test results do not suggest CMV infection as the likely cause of his condition. The patient's recent history of mild chest pain and radiation to the left arm, along with the ECG and echocardiogram results, are more consistent with a coronary event or rejection episode.

**Answer**:C. Administer empirical pulse-dose corticosteroids.

This answer is incorrect because while corticosteroids may be used to treat rejection episodes, they are not the appropriate first-line treatment for a patient with symptoms suggestive of a coronary event. The patient's symptoms and test results suggest a possible coronary event or rejection episode, and corticosteroids may not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

**Answer**:D. Perform an endomyocardial biopsy alone.

This answer is incorrect because while an endomyocardial biopsy may be necessary to assess for rejection, it is not sufficient to diagnose a coronary event. The patient's symptoms and test results suggest a possible coronary event or rejection episode, and an emergent coronary angiogram is necessary to evaluate the coronary arteries and identify any blockages or stenosis that may be causing the patient's symptoms.

**Answer**:A. Carcinoma erysipeloides (cutaneous metastases of breast cancer)

The patient's history of advanced breast cancer, with local disease recurrence and metastasis to the axillary lymph nodes, and the presence of discrete erysipeloid plaques on her chest, back, and right shoulder, are consistent with cutaneous metastases of breast cancer, also known as carcinoma erysipeloides. The patient's age and the fact that the lesions are warm and indurated but nontender to palpation also support this diagnosis.

Erysipelas is a bacterial infection of the skin that presents with redness, swelling, and warmth, but it is not associated with breast cancer or metastases. Therefore, choice B is incorrect.

Radiation dermatitis is a common side effect of radiation therapy, and it can cause skin changes similar to those described in the patient's history. However, the patient's history of breast cancer and the presence of discrete erysipeloid plaques make radiation dermatitis an unlikely diagnosis. Therefore, choice C is incorrect.

Radiation-induced morphea is a rare side effect of radiation therapy that can cause skin thickening and hardening. However, it is not associated with breast cancer or metastases, and it does not explain the patient's history of progressive, asymptomatic cutaneous eruption. Therefore, choice D is incorrect.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is D. Stroke the skin lesion.

This answer is correct because the patient's symptoms, as described in the question, do not suggest any obvious underlying condition that would require a skeletal survey or ophthalmologic consultation. The patient has multiple hyperpigmented macules on the back and thighs, without any prodromal erythema or trauma, and her vital signs and laboratory test results are normal. These symptoms do not suggest any systemic or infectious condition that would require further diagnostic testing.

The most appropriate next step would be to perform a thorough physical examination of the skin lesions, including a careful inspection of their size, shape, color, and texture. This would help to determine if the lesions are benign or if they require further evaluation.

Administering topical antifungals (choice A) would not be appropriate at this time, as there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has a fungal infection. Taking a more detailed drug history (choice B) would also not be necessary, as the patient's symptoms do not suggest any adverse drug reaction or medication-related condition. Performing a skeletal survey and referring for ophthalmologic consultation (choice C) would be unnecessary and potentially harmful, as there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has any bone or eye disorders.

Therefore, the best answer is D. Stroke the skin lesion, as it is the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation and management.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

**Answer**: B. Proliferative glomerulonephritis is the most likely diagnosis.

The patient's history of hypertension and elevated serum creatinine levels, along with the urinalysis results, suggest that there is kidney damage and inflammation present. The patient's urine output, proteinuria, and red blood cell casts indicate that there is an ongoing inflammatory process in the kidneys.

Proliferative glomerulonephritis is a type of kidney disease characterized by the proliferation of glomerular tissue, leading to inflammation and bleeding in the kidneys. The patient's urinalysis results, particularly the presence of red blood cell casts, are consistent with this diagnosis.

Urinary tract infection (UTI) is an unlikely diagnosis, as the patient does not report any symptoms of UTI, such as frequency, urgency, or dysuria. Additionally, the urinalysis results do not show any evidence of UTI, such as bacteriuria or pyuria.

Nonproliferative glomerulonephritis is a type of kidney disease characterized by damage to the glomeruli without proliferation. This diagnosis is less likely based on the patient's urinalysis results, which show evidence of inflammation and bleeding in the kidneys.

Hypertensive nephrosclerosis is a type of kidney disease caused by high blood pressure, leading to damage to the glomeruli and kidney tissue. While the patient's history of hypertension increases the likelihood of this diagnosis, the urinalysis results do not support it, as there is no evidence of kidney damage or inflammation.

Therefore, based on the patient's history and urinalysis results, proliferative glomerulonephritis is the most likely diagnosis.

**Answer**:B. Generalized Hailey-Hailey disease

The correct answer is B. Generalized Hailey-Hailey disease. The patient's history of recurrent skin lesions limited to the axillae and groin, followed by the development of widespread erythematous crusted plaques on the trunk, sparing the limbs and facial region, is consistent with the clinical presentation of Generalized Hailey-Hailey disease.

The patient's age and lack of family history also support this diagnosis, as Generalized Hailey-Hailey disease typically affects adults in their 40s to 60s and has no known familial association.

The histopathologic findings of suprabasilar acantholysis (as seen in Figure C) and the presence of a crusted and pustular peripheral collarette (as seen in Figure B) are also consistent with Generalized Hailey-Hailey disease.

Pemphigus foliaceus (choice A) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the skin and mucous membranes, causing blisters and sores. While it can present with similar skin lesions, it typically affects the face, scalp, and trunk, and the patient's history of recurrent skin lesions limited to the axillae and groin does not support this diagnosis.

IgA pemphigus (choice C) is a rare autoimmune disease that affects the skin and mucous membranes, causing blisters and sores. It typically presents with lesions on the face, scalp, and trunk, and the patient's history of spared facial region and limbs does not support this diagnosis.

Pemphigus vulgaris (choice D) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the skin and mucous membranes, causing blisters and sores. It typically presents with lesions on the face, scalp, and trunk, and the patient's history of spared facial region and limbs does not support this diagnosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Generalized Hailey-Hailey disease.

D. Oral melanoacanthoma is the correct answer because it matches the clinical and histopathological features described in the case.

The patient presented with asymptomatic pigmented lesions on the gingiva, which were histopathologically characterized by a diffuse proliferation of heavily pigmented dendritic melanocytes that extended the full thickness of the epithelium, with melanin incontinence noted. These features are consistent with oral melanoacanthoma, a benign tumor of melanocytic origin that typically affects the oral mucosa.

In contrast, oral melanotic macule (choice A) is a flat, brown or black macule that can occur on the lips, buccal mucosa, or gingiva. While it may have some melanin pigmentation, it does not have the same degree of cellular proliferation and atypia as oral melanoacanthoma.

Oral malignant melanoma (choice B) is a malignant tumor that originates from melanocytes and typically presents as a pigmented lesion with irregular borders, ulceration, and bleeding. While it can affect the oral mucosa, it is less common than other types of oral cancer. The histopathological features described in the case do not support a diagnosis of oral malignant melanoma.

Oral melanocytic nevus (choice C) is a benign tumor of melanocytic origin that can occur on the skin or mucous membranes. It is characterized by a proliferation of melanocytes, but the cells are typically not as heavily pigmented as those seen in oral melanoacanthoma. Additionally, oral melanocytic nevi typically do not exhibit the same degree of spongiosis and melanin incontinence as seen in the case.

Therefore, based on the clinical and histopathological features described, the correct answer is D. Oral melanoacanthoma.

D. Cutaneous Bacillus cereus infection is the correct answer because the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with this diagnosis.

The patient developed a vesicular rash on the lower back and left thigh while neutropenic, which is a common site for cutaneous infections. The presence of an erythematous base surrounding the vesicles suggests an inflammatory response, which is consistent with a bacterial infection. The gram stain (Figure, D) shows numerous gram-positive rods, which are characteristic of Bacillus cereus. The hematoxylin-eosin stain (Figures, B and C) shows a mixed inflammatory infiltrate with numerous neutrophils, which is consistent with a bacterial infection.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella zoster virus (VZV) are both viral infections that can cause vesicular rashes, but they are unlikely in this case because the patient's rash is primarily on the lower back and left thigh, rather than on the face or trunk, which are more common sites for HSV and VZV. Additionally, the patient's neutropenia and recent chemotherapy make it less likely that she has a viral infection.

Listeriosis is a bacterial infection caused by Listeria monocytogenes, which can cause a vesicular rash, but it is unlikely in this case because the patient's rash is primarily on the lower back and left thigh, rather than on the face or trunk, which are more common sites for listeriosis. Additionally, the patient's recent chemotherapy and neutropenia make it less likely that she has listeriosis.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is cutaneous Bacillus cereus infection.

**Answer**:C. Neurocutaneous melanosis

The correct answer is C. Neurocutaneous melanosis.

Neurocutaneous melanosis is a rare condition characterized by the presence of melanocytic lesions in the central nervous system, including the brain and spinal cord. The condition is often associated with a genetic mutation in the N-ras-2 gene, which is also known as the NRAS gene.

In this case, the patient presented with intermittent limp and increasing headache, which worsened over time. The MRI scans showed multiple parenchymal lesions involving the pons, bilateral amygdala, and the left temporal pole. The lesions progressed over time, with a newly developed mass in the third ventricle and obstructive hydrocephalus. The patient also had multiple congenital nevi distributed over her body, which is a common feature of neurocutaneous melanosis.

The patient's genetic testing showed a mutation in the N-ras-2 gene, which supports the diagnosis of neurocutaneous melanosis. This condition is often associated with a poor prognosis, and treatment options are limited.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Metastatic melanoma: Metastatic melanoma is a type of cancer that originates in the skin or eyes and spreads to other parts of the body, including the brain. However, the patient's history of intermittent limp and increasing headache, along with the presence of multiple congenital nevi, does not support this diagnosis.

B. Primary intracranial melanoma: Primary intracranial melanoma is a rare type of cancer that originates in the brain. However, the patient's history and MRI scans do not support this diagnosis, as the lesions were not confined to a single location and did not have the typical characteristics of a primary brain tumor.

D. Lymphoma: Lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the immune system. While it can affect the brain, the patient's history and MRI scans do not support this diagnosis, as the lesions were not consistent with lymphoma and there was no evidence of

**Answer**:B. Nicolau syndrome (livedoid dermatitis)

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with Nicolau syndrome, also known as livedoid dermatitis. This is a rare condition characterized by painful, retiform purpura with central necrosis, typically occurring after intramuscular injections. The patient's history of severe pain at the injection site, rapid onset of swelling and purpura, and numbness and tingling of the skin involved, are all consistent with this diagnosis.

The other options are less likely:

A. Pyomyositis: This is an infection of the muscle tissue, which can cause pain, swelling, and fever. However, the patient did not have fever or chills, and the muscle tenderness and swelling were not consistent with pyomyositis.

C. Retained foreign body: This can cause pain and swelling at the injection site, but the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are not consistent with a retained foreign body.

D. Necrotizing fasciitis: This is a serious infection of the soft tissues that can cause pain, swelling, and skin necrosis. However, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are not consistent with necrotizing fasciitis, as the skin changes were limited to the area of the injection and there was no evidence of systemic illness.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Nicolau syndrome (livedoid dermatitis).

**Answer**: D. Ectopic ovarian torsion

The correct answer is D. Ectopic ovarian torsion because it aligns with the patient's symptoms and the imaging results.

Let's go through each answer choice and explain why the others are incorrect:

A. Perforated appendicitis: This choice seems like a reasonable option given the patient's abdominal pain and tenderness. However, the imaging results do not support this diagnosis. The CT scan shows an inflamed retrocecal mass, which is not consistent with appendicitis. Additionally, the patient's symptoms of anorexia and nonbloody, nonbilious emesis are not typically seen in appendicitis.

B. Meckel diverticulitis: Meckel diverticulitis is a rare condition that occurs when there is inflammation of the Meckel's diverticulum, a small pouch that forms during fetal development. This choice is unlikely because the patient's symptoms do not match the typical presentation of Meckel diverticulitis, which includes rectal bleeding, fever, and abdominal pain. Moreover, the imaging results do not show any signs of inflammation in the Meckel's diverticulum.

C. Crohn disease: Crohn disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract. This choice is unlikely because the patient's symptoms do not suggest inflammatory bowel disease. The patient does not have diarrhea, rectal bleeding, or weight loss, which are common symptoms of Crohn disease. Additionally, the imaging results do not show any signs of inflammation in the bowel.

D. Ectopic ovarian torsion: This is the correct answer. Ectopic ovarian torsion occurs when the ovary becomes twisted, cutting off blood supply to the ovary. This can cause severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and fever. The patient's symptoms of right lower quadrant abdominal pain, anorexia, and nonbloody, nonbilious emesis

**Answer**: B. Spontaneous chylothorax

Spontaneous chylothorax is a rare condition characterized by the accumulation of chyle in the pleural space, without any obvious cause such as trauma or surgery. The patient's symptoms of severe substernal pain radiating to the left shoulder and back, along with the physical examination findings of soft tissue swelling over the left supraclavicular area and bilateral pleural effusions, are consistent with this diagnosis. The laboratory finding of leukocytosis also supports this diagnosis, as it is a common finding in patients with chylothorax.

The computed tomographic scan findings of extensive edema of the left neck, with fat stranding seen in the subcutaneous tissues extending into the left jugular, carotid, and esophageal spaces, are also consistent with spontaneous chylothorax. The presence of bilateral pleural effusions and mediastinal edema on the computed tomographic scan also supports this diagnosis.

The other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and findings. Acute jugular thrombosis (choice A) is unlikely given the absence of any recent trauma or surgery, and the patient's symptoms of substernal pain and bilateral pleural effusions. Contained esophageal perforation (choice C) is also unlikely given the absence of any signs of perforation on the barium swallow and the patient's symptoms of substernal pain and bilateral pleural effusions. Descending necrotizing mediastinitis (choice D) is a rare and life-threatening condition that typically presents with fever, chest pain, and difficulty swallowing, and is often caused by a bacterial infection. While the patient's symptoms of substernal pain and bilateral pleural effusions may be consistent with this diagnosis, the absence of any signs of infection and the patient's recent history of forceful coughing make it less likely.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and findings, the most likely diagnosis is spontaneous chylothorax.

**Answer**:C. Evaluate for systemic infectious disease

The correct answer is C. Evaluate for systemic infectious disease, because the patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a possible diagnosis of meningitis, which is an infection that affects the protective membranes (meninges) covering the brain and spinal cord. The patient's fever, malaise, photophobia, phonophobia, headache, nausea, vomiting, and neck stiffness are all consistent with meningitis. Additionally, the patient's elevated systemic inflammatory markers, including a left-shifted leukocytosis, elevated C-reactive protein level, and elevated protein levels in the cerebrospinal fluid, support this diagnosis. It is important to evaluate the patient for systemic infectious disease to identify the underlying cause of the meningitis and to provide appropriate treatment.

Option A, Initiate systemic corticosteroids, is not the correct answer, because corticosteroids are not typically used to treat meningitis. While corticosteroids may be used in some cases to reduce inflammation, they are not the primary treatment for meningitis.

Option B, Treat with an intraocular corticosteroid injection, is also not the correct answer, because the patient's blurred vision is not caused by an ocular problem, but rather by the meningitis affecting the brain. Intraocular corticosteroid injections are used to treat ocular inflammation, not systemic infections.

Option D, Begin administering intravenous acyclovir, is not the correct answer, because acyclovir is an antiviral medication used to treat herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections. While HSV infections can cause meningitis, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not suggest an HSV infection. Additionally, acyclovir is not effective against bacterial infections, which are a more likely cause of meningitis.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Evaluate for systemic infectious disease, which is the most appropriate next step in the patient's management

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is C. Order computed tomography of the head/facial bones.

The patient's symptoms of a deep laceration extending from the right upper zygoma across the nasal dorsum and involving the eyelid-cheek junction, along with a significant amount of clear fluid draining from the wound site, suggest a possible fracture of the facial bones or a breach of the cranial cavity. This could potentially lead to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage, which would require urgent attention.

Computed tomography (CT) imaging is the best diagnostic tool to evaluate the extent of the injury and identify any fractures, displacements, or depressions of the facial bones, as well as any potential breach of the cranial cavity. CT imaging can also help identify any other associated injuries, such as intracranial hemorrhage or skull base fractures.

Therefore, choice C is the correct answer, as it is essential to rule out any life-threatening conditions before proceeding with further management of the patient's facial injuries.

Now, let's discuss why the other choices are incorrect:

A. Perform nasolacrimal duct irrigation: While this may be a necessary step in managing the patient's laceration, it is not the most appropriate first step. The patient's symptoms suggest a more severe injury, and the risk of CSF leakage or other life-threatening complications takes precedence over the need for nasolacrimal duct irrigation.

B. Explore, irrigate, and close the wound: This choice is also not appropriate as the first step. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a more complex injury that requires further evaluation before surgical intervention. Closing the wound without proper evaluation and management of any potential complications could lead to adverse outcomes.

D. Order magnetic resonance imaging of the head: While MRI can provide valuable information about soft tissue injuries, it is not the most appropriate imaging modality in this case. CT imaging is better suited to evaluate bony structures

**Answer**:B. Obtain more information on the patient’s history

The correct answer is B. Obtain more information on the patient’s history. The patient presented with persistent blurry vision one week after uncomplicated cataract surgery, and the dilated fundus examination revealed multiple spots of retinal whitening with tiny intraretinal hemorrhages concentrated in the posterior pole. These findings suggest possible retinal complications from the surgery, and it is crucial to obtain more information on the patient's history to determine the underlying cause.

Option A, starting systemic steroids, may be considered for treating inflammatory or autoimmune conditions that could cause retinal whitening, but it is not the most appropriate step at this point. The patient's history and clinical presentation do not suggest an inflammatory or autoimmune condition, and steroids may not address the underlying cause of the retinal whitening.

Option C, vitreous tap and injection of foscarnet, is a procedure that may be considered for treating certain retinal conditions, such as retinal detachment or severe vitreous hemorrhage. However, it is not the most appropriate step in this case, as the patient's presentation does not suggest a retinal detachment or severe vitreous hemorrhage, and the use of foscarnet may not be necessary or effective for the patient's condition.

Option D, infectious and autoimmune workup, may be considered to rule out infectious or autoimmune conditions that could cause retinal whitening. However, it is not the most appropriate step at this point, as the patient's history and clinical presentation do not suggest an infectious or autoimmune condition, and the workup may not provide a clear diagnosis or guide treatment.

Therefore, the most appropriate step is to obtain more information on the patient's history, including any previous eye surgeries, medical conditions, medications, and other relevant details that may help determine the underlying cause of the retinal whitening. This information can help guide further evaluation and management of the patient's condition.

**Answer**:B. Shorten the programmed AV delay to 150 milliseconds

The patient's recent fall and generalized weakness and fatigue suggest that he may have experienced a syncopal episode related to a prolonged AV delay. The patient's pacemaker is programmed to a DDDR pacing mode with an AV delay of 300 milliseconds, which may be too long, especially during physical activity or exertion. Shortening the programmed AV delay to 150 milliseconds would allow for a more prompt atrial response to ventricular depolarization, potentially reducing the risk of syncopal episodes.

Increasing the atrial pacing rate to 70 beats per minute (choice A) may not address the underlying cause of the syncopal episodes and may lead to increased battery consumption.

Increasing the postventricular atrial refractory period to 250 milliseconds (choice C) may not be effective in preventing syncopal episodes and may also lead to reduced atrial pacing.

Referring the patient for pacemaker lead revision (choice D) may not be necessary at this time and may not address the immediate concern of the syncopal episodes.

Therefore, the best answer is B. Shorten the programmed AV delay to 150 milliseconds.

**Answer**: C. Plasmacytoma

The patient's history of IgGκ multiple myeloma and the presence of painful cutaneous nodules are consistent with a diagnosis of plasmacytoma. Plasmacytoma is a type of plasma cell dyscrasia that is characterized by the proliferation of abnormal plasma cells in the bone marrow and/or extramedullary tissues. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, including the presence of nonulcerated, round, smooth, fixed, and firm tender nodules on the trunk and extremities, are consistent with plasmacytoma. The fact that the patient had completed 4 cycles of RVD therapy and irradiation for lytic lesions of the thoracic and lumbar spine also supports this diagnosis, as plasmacytoma can occur as a complication of multiple myeloma treatment.

A. Hemangioma is a benign vascular tumor that is not related to multiple myeloma or plasmacytoma. Although it can present with cutaneous nodules, the nodules are usually small and soft, and not painful.

B. Neutrophilic dermatoses are a group of skin disorders characterized by the infiltration of neutrophils into the skin. Although they can present with painful nodules, they are not related to multiple myeloma or plasmacytoma.

D. Leukemia cutis is a rare complication of hematological malignancies, including multiple myeloma, and is characterized by the infiltration of leukemic cells into the skin. However, in this case, the patient's history and physical examination findings are not consistent with leukemia cutis. The absence of ulceration, the smooth surface, and the firm and tender consistency of the nodules also argue against this diagnosis.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is B: The patient has probable invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.

Let's go through each answer choice and explain why it's incorrect or correct:

A: The patient has proven invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.

This answer is incorrect because the patient's test results do not meet the criteria for proven invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. The patient's blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid test results show the presence of Aspergillus galactomannan, but the patient does not have any signs of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, such as fever, chest pain, or hemoptysis. Additionally, the patient's chest CT scan does not show any signs of invasive disease.

B: The patient has probable invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.

This answer is correct because the patient's test results suggest the presence of Aspergillus galactomannan in the blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, which is consistent with probable invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. The patient's clinical presentation, including worsening dyspnea and dry cough, is also consistent with probable invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. However, the patient's lack of fever and chest pain, as well as the absence of any radiographic evidence of invasive disease, suggest that the infection may not be fully established.

C: The patient does not meet criteria for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.

This answer is incorrect because the patient's test results show the presence of Aspergillus galactomannan in the blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, which meets the criteria for probable invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.

D: The patient is not at risk for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and the results reflect colonization.

This answer is incorrect because the patient is at risk for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis due to their underlying medical conditions, including granulomatous polyangiitis and end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis. Additionally, the patient's test results suggest the presence

**Answer**: A. Obtain a biopsy for hematoxylin-eosin stain

The correct answer is A, Obtain a biopsy for hematoxylin-eosin stain, because it is the most appropriate step to diagnose the pink nodule on the boy's left cheek. A biopsy will allow for a tissue sample to be examined under a microscope, which can help to determine the nature of the lesion and whether it is benign or malignant. Hematoxylin-eosin stain is a specific type of stain that is commonly used to examine the tissue sample and help identify the type of cells present.

In contrast, the other answer choices are not the most appropriate steps to diagnose the pink nodule.

**Answer**: B. Obtain a biopsy for fungal culture

While fungal infections can cause skin lesions, the presence of a pink nodule with central erosions on the boy's left cheek does not suggest a fungal infection. Fungal cultures are typically used to diagnose fungal infections, but in this case, it is not the most appropriate step.

**Answer**: C. Treat with cryotherapy

Cryotherapy is a treatment that uses extreme cold to destroy abnormal cells, such as warts or actinic keratoses. However, it is not the most appropriate treatment for a pink nodule on a child's cheek, especially without a definitive diagnosis.

**Answer**: D. Treat with pulsed dye laser therapy

Pulsed dye laser therapy is a treatment that uses a laser to reduce the appearance of blood vessels and redness in the skin. While it may be used to treat certain skin conditions, such as port wine stains or hemangiomas, it is not the most appropriate treatment for a pink nodule on a child's cheek.

Therefore, the correct answer is A, Obtain a biopsy for hematoxylin-eosin stain, as it is the most appropriate step to diagnose the pink nodule on the boy's left cheek.

The correct answer is C: The patient may be using hydrocodone but is using cocaine.

Let's break down each answer choice and explain why they are incorrect or correct:

A: The patient is not using hydrocodone but is using cocaine.
This answer choice is incorrect because the urine drug screen showed a positive result for hydrocodone. If the patient were not using hydrocodone, the result would have been negative. Additionally, the patient reported taking 2-3 tablets of hydrocodone/acetaminophen daily, which suggests that they are indeed using hydrocodone.

B: The patient is not using hydrocodone but may be using cocaine.
This answer choice is also incorrect for the same reason as A. The urine drug screen showed a positive result for hydrocodone, which means the patient is using hydrocodone.

D: The patient may be using both hydrocodone and cocaine.
This answer choice is possible but not definitively supported by the information provided. The urine drug screen showed a positive result for hydrocodone, but it did not show a positive result for cocaine. While it's possible that the patient may have used cocaine recently and it didn't show up on the drug screen, we cannot conclusively say that they are using both drugs based on the information provided.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: The patient may be using hydrocodone but is using cocaine. This answer choice acknowledges that the patient is using hydrocodone, as evidenced by the positive urine drug screen result, while also allowing for the possibility that they may be using cocaine, given the patient's history of cocaine use.

**Answer**:B. Results should be repeated in 12 weeks to confirm diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome.

The correct answer is B because the test results for antiphospholipid antibodies should be repeated in 12 weeks to confirm the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome. This is because the presence of these antibodies can be transient, and a single positive test result may not be sufficient to confirm the diagnosis. Repeating the test in 12 weeks allows for the detection of persistent antibody production, which is a key criterion for the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome.

Choice A is incorrect because the test results provided are not sufficient to diagnose antiphospholipid syndrome. Although the patient has had an unprovoked thrombotic event at a young age, which suggests a hypercoagulable state, a single positive test result for antiphospholipid antibodies is not enough to confirm the diagnosis.

Choice C is incorrect because heparin therapy does not affect the results of antiphospholipid antibody tests. Heparin is an anticoagulant that works by inhibiting thrombin, but it does not interfere with the immune response or the production of antibodies. Therefore, the presence of heparin therapy does not make the test results uninterpretable.

Choice D is incorrect because warfarin therapy also does not affect the results of antiphospholipid antibody tests. Warfarin is an anticoagulant that works by inhibiting the vitamin K-dependent synthesis of clotting factors, but it does not interfere with the immune response or the production of antibodies. Therefore, the presence of warfarin therapy does not make the test results uninterpretable.

**Answer**:C. Carcinoid syndrome

The patient's symptoms, such as flushing, diarrhea, and ocular manifestations, are consistent with carcinoid syndrome, which is a paraneoplastic syndrome associated with neuroendocrine tumors. The patient's history of a resected pulmonary tumor 10 years earlier, along with the immunohistochemical analysis of the tumor using chromogranin A, supports the diagnosis of a neuroendocrine tumor. The CT scan showing multiple metastatic hepatic masses also suggests a carcinoid tumor.

Leprosy (A) is an infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae and is characterized by skin lesions, nerve damage, and immune system dysfunction. While the patient's skin changes may resemble some of the skin lesions seen in leprosy, the absence of other characteristic features of leprosy, such as nerve damage, makes this diagnosis unlikely.

Mastocytosis (B) is a condition characterized by an excessive increase in mast cells in the skin and other organs. While the patient's skin changes may resemble those seen in mastocytosis, the presence of a pulmonary tumor and the patient's systemic symptoms make a diagnosis of carcinoid syndrome more likely.

Leishmaniasis (D) is a parasitic infection caused by Leishmania protozoa and is characterized by skin lesions and other systemic symptoms. While the patient's skin changes may resemble some of the skin lesions seen in leishmaniasis, the absence of other characteristic features of leishmaniasis, such as a history of travel to an endemic area and the presence of Leishmania parasites in the skin, makes this diagnosis unlikely.

**Answer**: B. IgA pemphigus

The correct answer is B. IgA pemphigus because it matches the clinical presentation and histopathological findings described in the case.

IgA pemphigus is a rare autoimmune bullous disease characterized by the deposition of IgA antibodies in the skin, leading to blistering and skin fragility. The clinical presentation typically includes flaccid pustules or bullae on the trunk and limbs, which is consistent with the case description.

Histopathological examination reveals subcorneal acantholysis, which is a hallmark of IgA pemphigus, and is characterized by the separation of keratinocytes from the basement membrane, leading to intraepidermal blistering. The inflammatory infiltrate composed of neutrophilic granulocytes is also consistent with IgA pemphigus.

Direct immunofluorescence with FITC-labeled antihuman IgA antibodies highlights discrete subcorneal intercellular IgA depositions, which is a key diagnostic feature of IgA pemphigus.

In contrast, Tinea corporis (choice A) is a fungal infection that typically presents with scaly, annular lesions, but the presence of flaccid pustules and the histopathological findings of subcorneal acantholysis and IgA depositions are not typical of Tinea corporis.

Duhring disease (choice C) is a rare autoimmune bullous disease that can present with flaccid pustules, but it typically affects the mucous membranes and the skin, and the histopathological findings are different from those seen in IgA pemphigus.

Psoriasis pustulosa (choice D) is a type of psoriasis that can present with pustules, but it typically has a different clinical and histopathological presentation, with a greater scale and crusting, and a lack of subcorneal acantholysis and IgA depositions.

Therefore, based on the clinical and histopathological findings described in the case, the diagnosis

**Answer**:A. Mucormycosis

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and lab results point to mucormycosis. The patient has a low white blood cell and neutrophil count, which indicates immunocompromise, a common risk factor for mucormycosis. The gray-violet plaque on the patient's arm is consistent with the characteristic skin lesions of mucormycosis. The histopathological analysis shows broad non-septate hyphae surrounding and infiltrating dermal blood vessels, which is consistent with the fungal infection. The presence of round terminal sporangia and free spores in the fungal culture further supports the diagnosis of mucormycosis.

B. Cutaneous diphtheria is an infection caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae, which can cause skin lesions. However, the patient's symptoms and lab results do not suggest diphtheria. The patient does not have the characteristic symptoms of diphtheria, such as fever, sore throat, or swollen lymph nodes. Additionally, the histopathological analysis does not show the characteristic features of diphtheria.

C. Pseudomonal ecthyma gangrenosum is a severe infection caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa that can cause skin lesions. However, the patient's symptoms and lab results do not suggest pseudomonal infection. The patient does not have the characteristic symptoms of pseudomonal infection, such as fever, chills, or redness and swelling at the site of infection. Additionally, the histopathological analysis does not show the characteristic features of pseudomonal infection.

D. Aspergillosis is a fungal infection caused by Aspergillus species that can cause skin lesions. However, the patient's symptoms and lab results do not suggest aspergillosis. The patient does not have the characteristic symptoms of aspergillosis, such as fever, cough, or chest pain. Additionally, the histopathological analysis does not show the characteristic features of aspergillosis.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is D. Herpes simplex virus. This is because the patient's symptoms, such as the grouped vesicles and punched-out ulcerations on the scalp, axilla, extremities, and scrotum, are consistent with a herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. HSV is a common viral infection that can cause a variety of skin and mucocutaneous lesions, including vesicles and ulcers. The high lymphocyte count and high aspartate aminotransferase level in the patient's initial laboratory evaluation also support this diagnosis.

A. Candidiasis is a fungal infection that can cause skin lesions, but it is not typically associated with the grouped vesicles and ulcers described in this patient. Additionally, the patient's history of preterm premature rupture of membranes and respiratory distress suggests a more severe infection than candidiasis.

B. Transient neonatal pustular melanosis is a benign condition that can cause pustules on the skin of newborns, but it is not associated with the other symptoms described in this patient, such as the respiratory distress and high lymphocyte count.

C. Congenital varicella is a rare condition that can cause skin lesions in newborns, but it is not typically associated with the grouped vesicles and ulcers described in this patient. Additionally, the patient's history of preterm premature rupture of membranes and respiratory distress suggests a more severe infection than congenital varicella.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Herpes simplex virus.

**Answer**:C. Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis

The patient's symptoms, such as a sudden, diffuse, and painful enlargement of the upper quadrants of the left breast with edema and palpable axillary lymph nodes without clinical signs of inflammation or infection, are consistent with idiopathic granulomatous mastitis. The patient's history of recent pneumonia and self-medication with antibiotics, as well as the absence of any trauma to the breast, family history of breast or ovarian cancer, and history of drug addiction or hyaluronic acid or free silicone injections in the breast, support this diagnosis.

The patient's breast ultrasonography and mammography results also support this diagnosis, as they reveal diffuse nonspecific hypoechogenicity of the breast tissue with periductal small cysts and asymmetric density and distortion in the left upper quadrants, respectively. The presence of granulomatous inflammation with epithelioid histiocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils in the breast tissue, as revealed by multiple 14-gauge ultrasound-guided biopsies and fine-needle aspiration cytologic testing of an enlarged lymph node, further supports this diagnosis.

Inflammatory breast cancer (choice A) is unlikely given the absence of skin redness, warmth, or swelling, as well as the lack of any significant lymphadenopathy or bone pain. Tuberculous mastitis (choice B) is also unlikely given the absence of any evidence of tuberculosis infection, such as a positive purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test or chest radiograph. Mastitis caused by immunosuppression (choice D) is unlikely given the absence of any history of immunosuppression or underlying immunodeficiency disorders.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Idiopathic granulomatous mastitis.

**Answer**: D. Unicentric Castleman disease

The correct diagnosis is D. Unicentric Castleman disease. Castleman disease is a rare benign tumor that arises from the lymphoid tissue. It is characterized by a hypervascular mass with a distinctive "salt and pepper" appearance on CT scans due to the numerous small blood vessels. The patient's symptoms of decreased appetite and the laboratory evaluation of plasma-free metanephrine levels showing a slight elevation in normetanephrine levels are consistent with Castleman disease.

The patient's age and the location of the mass in the retroperitoneum also support this diagnosis. The dilated tortuous supply from a lumbar artery branch and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy are also consistent with Castleman disease.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Angiosarcoma: Angiosarcoma is a malignant tumor that arises from the blood vessels and typically affects older adults. It is characterized by a rapidly growing mass with a distinctive "spider-like" appearance on CT scans due to the numerous small blood vessels. The patient's symptoms and laboratory evaluation do not support this diagnosis.

B. Leiomyosarcoma: Leiomyosarcoma is a malignant tumor that arises from the smooth muscle tissue. It typically affects older adults and can occur in various parts of the body, including the retroperitoneum. However, the patient's symptoms and laboratory evaluation do not support this diagnosis.

C. Pheochromocytoma: Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor that arises from the chromaffin cells of the adrenal gland. It typically affects older adults and can cause symptoms such as hypertension, palpitations, and sweating. The patient's laboratory evaluation showing a slight elevation in normetanephrine levels is consistent with pheochromocytoma, but the location of the mass in the retroperitoneum and the absence of any adrenal gland involvement make this diagnosis less likely

**Answer**:C. Observe and repeat spectral-domain optical coherence tomography in 6 months to 1 year

The patient in question has a history of Alport syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects the kidneys, eyes, and ears. The patient has presented with a bilateral retinal problem, with symptoms including blurred vision and herpes zoster ophthalmicus. The examination revealed an irregular-shaped area of red discoloration in the fovea and surrounding subtle flecking of the retina in both eyes, with no other abnormalities found on ophthalmoscopic examination.

Option A, perform pars plana vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane peeling, is not the best course of action at this time. While this procedure may be necessary in some cases of retinal disease, it is not indicated in this patient's case, as there is no evidence of significant vitreomacular traction or retinal detachment.

Option B, perform aqueous/vitreous tap for viral polymerase chain reaction and inject foscarnet intravitreally, is also not the best course of action. While this may be a reasonable approach in cases of suspected viral retinitis, there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has an active viral infection. The patient's symptoms and examination findings are more consistent with a chronic retinal condition, and the presence of Alport syndrome increases the likelihood of a non-infectious etiology.

Option D, perform intravitreal injection of ocriplasmin, is not a suitable option at this time. Ocriplasmin is a relatively new drug that has been shown to be effective in treating certain types of retinal disease, but its use is still limited to specific indications, and there is no evidence to suggest that it would be beneficial in this patient's case.

Therefore, the best course of action is to observe and repeat spectral-domain optical coherence tomography in 6 months to 1 year, as choice C suggests. This approach allows for close monitoring of the patient's condition, with the opportunity to intervene if there are any changes in the retina or if symptoms worsen over time.

**Answer**: D. Start systemic corticosteroids and biopsy the superficial temporal artery

The correct answer is D, Start systemic corticosteroids and biopsy the superficial temporal artery, because it is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's condition.

The patient presents with a 2-month history of a "cloudy spot" in her left eye, associated with jaw pain and fatigue, and weight loss. The examination reveals a small paracentral relative scotoma in the left eye and an arc-shaped area of retinal whitening in the nasal macula concentric to the optic disc. The optical coherence tomography shows localized hyperreflectivity and thickening of the retinal nerve fiber and ganglion cell layers.

The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of ocular ischemic syndrome (OIS), which is a condition characterized by decreased blood flow to the retina and optic nerve. The most common cause of OIS is atherosclerosis of the carotid or vertebral arteries, which can lead to a reduction in blood flow to the eye.

The first step in the management of OIS is to identify and treat any underlying systemic conditions that may be contributing to the decreased blood flow. In this case, the patient's history of jaw pain and fatigue, as well as the presence of a mouth guard for temporomandibular joint disease, suggests that there may be a connection between the patient's symptoms and her jaw. Therefore, starting systemic corticosteroids to reduce inflammation and swelling in the jaw and biopsying the superficial temporal artery to evaluate for a possible vasculitis or other inflammatory condition affecting the blood vessels, would be the most appropriate next step.

Option A, Observe and recommend smoking cessation, is not the most appropriate next step, as while smoking cessation may be beneficial for the patient's overall health, it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

Option B, Obtain a hypercoagulable laboratory workup, may be appropriate in some cases of OIS, but

**Answer**:A. Observe

The patient in this case has a history of Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome, which is a genetic disorder that affects the blood vessels and can cause bleeding in various parts of the body, including the eyes. The patient's symptoms of double vision, blurred vision, and pain in the right eye, as well as the physical findings of restricted supraduction and proptosis of the right eye, suggest that there may be a vascular abnormality in the right orbit.

The MRI scan shows a fusiform heterogeneous peripherally enhancing extraconal mass within the superior orbit on the right, which is likely a cavernous hemangioma, a type of vascular malformation that is common in patients with Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome. This mass is causing proptosis (bulging) of the right globe and displacement of the eye downward.

Given the patient's symptoms and the MRI findings, the best course of action would be to observe the patient closely, as the cavernous hemangioma may be causing the double vision and other symptoms. Observation is the most appropriate choice because it allows the clinician to monitor the patient's symptoms and see if they improve or worsen over time, without immediately resorting to surgical intervention.

The other choices are not as appropriate for several reasons:

* B. Perform canthotomy and cantholysis: Canthotomy and cantholysis are surgical procedures that are used to relieve orbital compartment syndrome, which is not the likely cause of the patient's symptoms. Orbital compartment syndrome occurs when there is an increase in pressure within the orbit, which can cause vision loss, pain, and other symptoms. In this case, the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a vascular abnormality, and canthotomy and cantholysis would not address the underlying cause of the problem.
* C. Perform fine-needle aspiration: Fine-needle aspiration is a procedure that is used to obtain a tissue sample for diagnostic purposes. In this case, the MRI scan has already provided a likely diagnosis of a cavernous hemangioma,

**Answer**:B. Observe and continue treatment for GVHD

The patient in this scenario has a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and has undergone allogenic bone marrow transplant, which has been complicated by severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of skin and liver. She has been admitted to the intensive care unit for respiratory failure and has been treated with vasopressors. The patient's recent development of bradycardia, as shown on telemetry, is concerning and warrants further evaluation.

Option A, placing a dual chamber pacemaker, is not the best course of action at this time. While the patient's bradycardia may be related to her GVHD, it is important to first evaluate the underlying cause of the bradycardia and ensure that it is not a result of a reversible cause, such as medication side effects or electrolyte imbalances. Additionally, placing a pacemaker in a patient with a history of GVHD may not be appropriate, as the device may not be able to effectively regulate the heart rate in the presence of ongoing immune system dysfunction.

Option C, placing an emergent transvenous temporary pacemaker, is also not the best course of action. While this option may be appropriate in certain emergency situations, such as a life-threatening arrhythmia, it is not necessary in this case, as the patient is not currently experiencing symptoms associated with bradycardia. Additionally, placing a temporary pacemaker may not address the underlying cause of the bradycardia and may not be effective in the long term.

Option D, placing an emergent transcutaneous pacemaker, is not appropriate for the same reasons as option C.

Therefore, the best course of action is to observe and continue treatment for GVHD, as this is the most likely cause of the patient's bradycardia. The patient's ongoing treatment for GVHD, including steroid and immunosuppressive medications, should be closely monitored and adjusted as needed to manage the patient's symptoms and prevent further complications. The patient's cardiac rhythm should also be closely monitored, and further evaluation, such as an electrophysiology

**Answer**:A. Rhabdomyoma

Rhabdomyoma is a rare benign tumor that originates from the soft tissues of the larynx. It is composed of polygonal cells with peripherally placed nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm containing cross-striations, which is consistent with the microscopic examination result described in the case. The patient's symptoms of progressive onset of nocturnal dyspnea, dysphonia, dysphagia, and noisy breathing over the previous year, as well as the mass effect on the larynx, are also consistent with a rhabdomyoma.

B. Granular cell tumor:
Granular cell tumors are rare benign tumors that can occur in various parts of the body, including the larynx. However, they are not typically associated with the symptoms described in the case, and their microscopic appearance is different from the polygonal cells with peripherally placed nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm containing cross-striations seen in rhabdomyoma.

C. Paraganglioma:
Paragangliomas are rare tumors that originate from the paraganglia, which are clusters of cells located near the sympathetic ganglia. They can occur in various parts of the body, including the head and neck, and can cause symptoms such as dysphagia, dysphonia, and nocturnal dyspnea. However, paragangliomas are typically associated with a different microscopic appearance, with cells that have a more uniform nuclei and a characteristic "salt and pepper" appearance.

D. Hibernoma:
Hibernomas are rare benign tumors that are composed of brown adipose tissue. They can occur in various parts of the body, including the head and neck, and can cause symptoms such as dysphagia and dysphonia.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain why D. Sweet syndrome is the correct answer and why the other choices are incorrect.

**Answer**: D. Sweet syndrome

Sweet syndrome is a rare, autoimmune disorder characterized by the sudden onset of fever, painful skin lesions, and a neutrophilic infiltrate. The patient's symptoms of fever, abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing, and painful eruption on the scalp, face, and left leg, as well as the physical examination findings of tender, edematous, targetoid nodules and plaques with central dusky appearance, are consistent with Sweet syndrome. The patient's history of neutropenia and recent scratches from his pet cat also support this diagnosis.

In contrast, Fusarium species infection (choice A) is a fungal infection that can cause skin lesions, but it typically presents with larger, more ulcerated lesions and does not have the characteristic dusky central appearance of Sweet syndrome. Bartonella henselae infection (choice B) can also cause skin lesions, but it typically presents with smaller, more papular lesions and does not have the same systemic symptoms as Sweet syndrome. Leukemia cutis (choice C) is a condition where leukemic cells infiltrate the skin, but it typically presents with larger, more nodular lesions and does not have the same acute onset of symptoms as Sweet syndrome.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is Sweet syndrome.

The correct answer is C: The patient has depressive symptoms of at least moderate severity.

Let's go through each answer choice and explain why it's incorrect or correct:

A: The patient has major depressive disorder.

This answer is incorrect because while the patient does have depressive symptoms, the severity of their symptoms is not explicitly stated to be severe enough to meet the criteria for major depressive disorder. The patient's symptoms are described as "at least moderate severity," which suggests that they may not be severe enough to meet the criteria for major depressive disorder.

B: The patient has dysthymic disorder.

This answer is incorrect because dysthymic disorder is a type of depression that is characterized by a long-term, low-grade depressed mood that lasts for at least two years. The patient's symptoms, while persistent, are not described as being of a long-term nature. Additionally, the patient's symptoms are described as being of at least moderate severity, which suggests that they may not meet the criteria for dysthymic disorder.

D: The patient does not have bipolar disorder.

This answer is incorrect because the patient's symptoms do not suggest the presence of bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder is characterized by episodes of mania or hypomania, which are not described in the patient's symptoms.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: The patient has depressive symptoms of at least moderate severity. This answer accurately reflects the patient's symptoms as described in the case scenario, and it does not imply a diagnosis that is not supported by the information provided.

The correct answer is **B**. Evaluate for systemic vasculitis.

The patient's symptoms of widespread, erythematous, purpuric macules and papules on the abdomen and extremities, as well as the skin biopsy results showing leukocytoclastic vasculitis, suggest a diagnosis of cutaneous vasculitis. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is a type of vasculitis that affects the skin and is characterized by the destruction of blood vessels by neutrophils.

Given the patient's history of chronic hepatitis B infection and recent initiation of tenofovir, it is important to consider the possibility of systemic vasculitis, which can be a serious and potentially life-threatening condition. Systemic vasculitis can affect multiple organs and systems in the body, including the skin, joints, kidneys, and nervous system.

Therefore, choice **B**, Evaluate for systemic vasculitis, is the correct answer. This option acknowledges the need to investigate the patient's symptoms further and rule out any potential systemic involvement.

On the other hand, choice **A**, Prescribe prednisone, may be a reasonable option for treating cutaneous vasculitis, but it does not address the potential systemic involvement. Prednisone is a corticosteroid that can help reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system, but it may not be effective in treating systemic vasculitis.

Choice **C**, Prescribe a topical glucocorticoid, may also be a reasonable option for treating cutaneous vasculitis, but it is not the most appropriate choice given the patient's history of chronic hepatitis B infection and recent initiation of tenofovir. Topical glucocorticoids are typically used to treat skin conditions that are limited to the skin, and may not be effective in treating systemic vasculitis.

Choice **D**, Provide reassurance and observe patient, may be appropriate for some patients with cutaneous vasculitis, but it is not the most appropriate choice in this case given the patient's history of chronic hepatitis B in

**Answer**:D. X-linked reticulate pigmentary disorder

The patient's symptoms, such as reticulate hyperpigmentation, hypohidrosis, photophobia, and recurrent sinopulmonary infections, are consistent with X-linked reticulate pigmentary disorder (XLRP). This is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the AGT gene, which codes for the enzyme alpha-galactosyltransferase. The disorder is X-linked recessive, meaning that the mutation is located on the X chromosome and affects males more severely than females. The patient's family history, with similarly affected men on his mother's side, supports this diagnosis.

In contrast, dermatopathia pigmentosa reticularis (A) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by reticulate hyperpigmentation, but it does not typically present with hypohidrosis, photophobia, or sinopulmonary infections. Dowling-Degos disease (B) is a rare genetic disorder that can present with reticulate hyperpigmentation, but it is typically associated with palmoplantar keratoderma and periodontitis, which are not mentioned in the patient's history. Dyskeratosis congenita (C) is a rare genetic disorder that can present with reticulate hyperpigmentation, but it is typically associated with nail dystrophy, alopecia, and bone marrow failure, which are not mentioned in the patient's history.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and family history, X-linked reticulate pigmentary disorder is the most likely diagnosis.

**Answer**: C. Macular lymphocytic arteritis

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with macular lymphocytic arteritis. The presence of discrete, asymptomatic, brown lesions distributed over the lower extremities and dorsal feet, with no prior trauma or lesions at these sites, suggests a diagnosis of macular lymphocytic arteritis. The patient's age and lack of significant past medical history also support this diagnosis.

The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings:

A. Lichen planus pigmentosus is a condition that causes hyperpigmentation and can appear as asymptomatic, flat, brown or gray macules on the skin. However, it typically affects sun-exposed areas and is not typically found on the lower extremities.

B. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is a condition that causes inflammation of the small blood vessels and can result in hyperpigmentation. However, it typically presents with symptoms such as fever, arthralgias, myalgias, and constitutional symptoms, which the patient did not report.

D. Erythema dyschromicum perstans is a condition that causes irregular, asymptomatic, hyperpigmented macules on the skin. However, it typically affects the face, neck, and upper part of the body, and not the lower extremities.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is macular lymphocytic arteritis.

**Answer**: C. Xanthoma disseminatum

Xanthoma disseminatum is a rare benign condition characterized by the development of multiple yellow-brown or red-brown papules on the skin. The condition typically affects young adults, and the lesions are usually distributed symmetrically on the body, including the axillae, inguinal folds, and proximal thighs. The patient's symptoms of polyuria, polydipsia, and nocturia, as well as the absence of mucosal involvement, are also consistent with this diagnosis.

In contrast, Xanthogranuloma (choice A) is a benign tumor that typically appears as a single, painless, yellow-brown nodule on the skin. It is usually found on the head, neck, or extremities, and is more common in adults than children. Erdheim-Chester disease (choice B) is a rare, benign condition characterized by the proliferation of histiocytes in the skin and other organs. It typically presents with red-brown papules or nodules on the skin, but can also involve the eyes, bones, and other organs. Generalized eruptive histiocytoma (choice D) is a rare, benign condition characterized by the widespread development of histiocytic infiltrates in the skin. It typically presents with numerous, small, red papules on the trunk and extremities.

Given the patient's symptoms and the distribution of the lesions, Xanthoma disseminatum is the most likely diagnosis.

**Answer**: B. Dyshidrotic eczema

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with dyshidrotic eczema, also known as pompholyx. This condition is characterized by the development of small, itchy blisters on the hands and feet, which can progress to larger, tense bullae. The blisters are typically skin-colored or slightly violaceous, and may have a tapioca-like appearance. The patient's history of atopic dermatitis and the presence of xerosis on the trunk and extremities also support this diagnosis.

In contrast, childhood bullous pemphigoid (choice A) is a rare autoimmune disorder that causes large, fluid-filled blisters to form on the skin, often in response to a trigger such as a viral infection. The blisters are typically larger than those seen in dyshidrotic eczema and may be distributed more widely across the body.

Bullous tinea (choice C) is a fungal infection that causes large, fluid-filled blisters to form on the skin, typically in response to a fungal infection. The blisters are often larger than those seen in dyshidrotic eczema and may be distributed more widely across the body. The patient's history of atopic dermatitis and the presence of xerosis on the trunk and extremities make it less likely that this is the correct diagnosis.

Distal blistering dactylitis (choice D) is a rare condition that causes blisters to form on the distal aspects of the fingers and toes. The blisters are typically small and may be associated with erythema and swelling. This condition is often seen in patients with diabetes or other systemic conditions, and is not consistent with the patient's symptoms or physical examination findings.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is dyshidrotic eczema, or pompholyx.

**Answer**: C. Mucocele of the appendix

The correct answer is C. Mucocele of the appendix because it matches the patient's symptoms and the findings on the CT scan.

A. Appendix abscess is an inflammatory process that involves the appendix, usually caused by bacterial infection. The patient did not report any symptoms of appendicitis such as fever, nausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain, which suggests that this is not the most likely diagnosis. Additionally, the CT scan does not show any evidence of an abscess.

B. Cecal carcinoma is a type of colon cancer that affects the cecum. The patient did not report any symptoms of colon cancer such as blood in the stool, change in bowel habits, or abdominal pain. Moreover, the colonoscopy did not show any intraluminal mucosal abnormalities or masses, which makes this diagnosis less likely.

D. Neuroendocrine tumor is a type of tumor that originates from the neuroendocrine cells of the gut. This diagnosis is unlikely because the patient did not report any symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, or flushing, which are commonly associated with neuroendocrine tumors. Moreover, the CT scan does not show any evidence of a tumor.

C. Mucocele of the appendix, on the other hand, is a benign tumor that originates from the appendix. The patient's symptoms of abdominal discomfort and a palpable mass in the right iliac fossa are consistent with this diagnosis. The CT scan also shows a large cystic mass in the right iliac fossa, which is consistent with a mucocele. The fact that the colonoscopy showed evidence of external compression at the cecum also supports this diagnosis, as a mucocele can cause compression on the surrounding structures.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and the findings on the CT scan and colonoscopy, the most likely diagnosis is C. Mucocele of the appendix.

**Answer**: C. Afferent loop syndrome

The patient's symptoms of waxing and waning sharp abdominal pain radiating to his back, along with an elevated lipase level of 2842 U/L, are consistent with acute pancreatitis. The patient's history of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and previous Whipple procedure increase the likelihood of afferent loop syndrome as the underlying cause of the pancreatitis. Afferent loop syndrome is a complication that can occur after a Whipple procedure, where the pancreatic remnant becomes kinked or twisted, leading to a decrease in pancreatic secretions and obstruction of the pancreatic duct. This can cause abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, which are consistent with the patient's symptoms.

Option A, tumor recurrence, is unlikely given the patient's history of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and previous treatment with a Whipple procedure. While it is possible for cancer to recur after treatment, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not suggest a recurrence.

Option B, marginal ulcer, is also unlikely given the patient's history of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and previous Whipple procedure. Marginal ulcers are a complication that can occur after a Whipple procedure, but they typically present with symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, which are consistent with the patient's symptoms.

Option D, internal hernia, is not supported by the patient's symptoms or laboratory results. While an internal hernia can cause abdominal pain and discomfort, it is unlikely to cause the patient's symptoms of waxing and waning sharp abdominal pain radiating to his back, along with an elevated lipase level.

Therefore, the correct answer is C, afferent loop syndrome.

**Answer**:C. Perform a biopsy of the lesion

The patient's symptoms of intermittent ocular irritation, discharge, and blurry vision in his left eye, along with the physical examination findings of a soft tissue lesion on the palpebral conjunctiva of the left lower eyelid, inferior bulbar conjunctival injection, and a small paracentral anterior stromal scar, suggest a possible diagnosis of ocular graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). The patient's history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, as well as the use of systemic tacrolimus to treat extensive graft-vs-host disease, further support this diagnosis.

Performing a biopsy of the lesion (choice C) is the most appropriate next step in the patient's management. This will allow for a definitive diagnosis of the conjunctival lesion and guide further treatment. The biopsy may also provide additional information regarding the presence of any other potential ocular surface diseases, such as herpes simplex keratitis or fungal infection, which may be contributing to the patient's symptoms.

In contrast, performing time-domain anterior segment optical coherence tomography (choice A) may provide additional information regarding the structure of the conjunctiva and any potential changes in the anterior segment, but it is not the most appropriate next step in the patient's management. Observing the patient (choice B) without performing any further diagnostic tests or interventions may not provide sufficient information to guide management, and may result in a delay in diagnosis and treatment. Obtaining a culture of the lesion (choice D) may be considered if there is a concern for infection, but it is not the most appropriate next step in the patient's management given the patient's history of GVHD and the physical examination findings.

**Answer**:C. Discuss the potential risks and benefits of initiating oral corticosteroid therapy

**Why**:

* **A**: Recommending multivitamin supplementation without addressing the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms may not improve their condition and may even cause harm by masking the symptoms, leading to a delay in proper diagnosis and treatment.
* **B**: While intravitreal anti-VEGF injections can be effective in treating certain eye conditions, such as age-related macular degeneration, they are not appropriate for the patient's condition, which is characterized by subretinal macular lesions with no evidence of neovascularization or fluid.
* **D**: Observation for spontaneous resolution may be appropriate for some eye conditions, but it is not the best course of action for this patient, given the acute onset and progressive nature of their symptoms, as well as the presence of bilateral macular lesions.

In contrast, discussing the potential risks and benefits of initiating oral corticosteroid therapy is an appropriate next step in the patient's management, as it may help to reduce inflammation and prevent further vision loss. However, it is important to carefully weigh the potential benefits against the potential risks, such as the risk of steroid-induced glaucoma, cataracts, and systemic side effects. A thorough discussion with the patient and close monitoring are necessary to ensure that the benefits of corticosteroid therapy outweigh the risks.

**Answer**:A. Perform rapid plasma reagin and confirmatory fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption testing

The correct answer is A, Perform rapid plasma reagin and confirmatory fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption testing, because it is the most appropriate next step in the evaluation of this patient's symptoms and examination findings.

The patient's symptoms of intermittent facial tingling, pulsatile tinnitus, acute-onset worsening blurry vision, altered color perception, and paracentral scotomas in both eyes, along with the physical examination findings of mild optic disc edema and hyperemia, large, pale-yellowish, placoid lesions within the macula of both eyes, and extensive disruption of the ellipsoid and interdigitation zones on optical coherence tomography, are consistent with a diagnosis of syphilitic retinitis.

Syphilitic retinitis is an ocular manifestation of syphilis, a sexually transmitted infection caused by Treponema pallidum. It is a medical emergency that requires prompt treatment to prevent further vision loss. The diagnosis of syphilitic retinitis is based on a combination of clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies.

Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) and confirmatory fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) testing are sensitive and specific laboratory tests that can confirm the diagnosis of syphilis. RPR is a non-treponemal test that measures antibodies against lipid antigens released from damaged host cells, while FTA-ABS is a treponemal test that detects antibodies against T. pallidum. These tests can help establish the diagnosis of syphilitic retinitis and guide treatment decisions.

Option B, starting oral corticosteroids, is not the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient. Although corticosteroids may be used to reduce inflammation and prevent further vision loss in some cases of syphilitic retinitis, they should not be initiated until the diagnosis

**Answer**: D. Give adenosine for treatment of supraventricular tachycardia

The patient's presentation of chest pain, dyspnea, and tachycardia suggests a potential cardiac etiology. The wide complex tachycardia (WCT) on the electrocardiogram (ECG) suggests a supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with aberrant conduction, which can mimic ventricular tachycardia. The patient's history of hypertension and the echocardiogram findings of left ventricular ejection fraction 45% and moderate mitral regurgitation suggest that the patient has underlying heart disease.

Option A, perform direct current cardioversion followed by coronary angiography, may be appropriate for ventricular tachycardia, but it is not the best choice for SVT. Cardioversion may not be effective in converting the rhythm and may cause harm in the presence of underlying heart disease. Coronary angiography may be necessary later, but it is not the first step in managing the patient's immediate condition.

Option B, give amiodarone for treatment of ventricular tachycardia, is not appropriate because the patient does not have ventricular tachycardia. Amiodarone is also not the first-line medication for SVT.

Option C, give procainamide for treatment of preexcited atrial fibrillation, is not appropriate because the patient does not have atrial fibrillation. Procainamide is also not effective in converting SVT.

Option D, give adenosine for treatment of supraventricular tachycardia, is the best choice. Adenosine is a specific treatment for SVT, and it can effectively convert the rhythm and relieve symptoms. It is also safe to use in patients with underlying heart disease.

Therefore, the correct answer is Option D, give adenosine for treatment of supraventricular tachycardia.

**Answer**: D. The patient has hypercalciuria due to idiopathic hypercalciuria.

The patient's 24-hour urine calcium level is 256mg/day, which is above the normal range of 100-250mg/day. This indicates that the patient has hypercalciuria.

Choice A, "The patient has hypercalciuria due to distal renal tubular acidosis," is incorrect because the patient's urine pH is 6.0, which is within the normal range of 5.0-7.0. Distal renal tubular acidosis is characterized by a low urine pH, typically below 5.0.

Choice B, "The patient has hypercalciuria due to high animal protein intake," is incorrect because the patient's dietary intake of animal protein is not unusually high. Although a high animal protein intake can increase urinary calcium excretion, it is not the likely cause of hypercalciuria in this case.

Choice C, "The patient has hypercalciuria due to high salt intake," is incorrect because the patient's urine sodium level is 49 mEq/day, which is within the normal range of 20-100 mEq/day. High salt intake can increase urinary calcium excretion, but it is not the likely cause of hypercalciuria in this case.

Therefore, the correct answer is choice D, "The patient has hypercalciuria due to idiopathic hypercalciuria." Idiopathic hypercalciuria is a condition in which there is an increase in urinary calcium excretion without an identifiable cause. It is possible that the patient has a genetic predisposition to idiopathic hypercalciuria, which is supported by the family history of nephrolithiasis in his mother.

In summary, the patient's hypercalciuria is most likely due to idiopathic hypercalciuria, as there is no evidence to support the other choices.

Answer: B. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor

The correct diagnosis is B. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, as it best fits the clinical and imaging features described in the case.

A. Nodular fasciitis is a benign tumor that typically presents as a rapidly growing mass in the soft tissues, often with a characteristic "salt and pepper" appearance on imaging. While it can have a similar appearance to the mass described in the case, the presence of a well-defined border, indentation into the masseter muscle, and strong contrast enhancement on MRI suggests a more aggressive lesion, which is not consistent with nodular fasciitis.

C. Spindle cell carcinoma is a malignant tumor that can arise in various parts of the body, including the parotid gland. However, the absence of atypia and the presence of a storiform pattern in the tumor cells, as described in the case, are not consistent with the features of spindle cell carcinoma.

D. Rhabdomyosarcoma is a malignant tumor that can arise in the soft tissues, including the parotid gland. However, the presence of a well-defined border, indentation into the masseter muscle, and strong contrast enhancement on MRI, as well as the negative staining for cytokeratin and CD34, are not consistent with rhabdomyosarcoma.

Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a rare benign tumor that can arise in various parts of the body, including the parotid gland. It is characterized by a mixture of inflammatory cells, myofibroblasts, and extracellular matrix. The clinical and imaging features described in the case, including the diffuse swelling of the parotid gland, the firm and slightly mobile mass, and the strong contrast enhancement on MRI, are consistent with IMT.

**Answer**: C. Plasmablastic lymphoma

Plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL) is a rare and aggressive type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is commonly associated with immunodeficiency, particularly in patients with HIV/AIDS. The patient's history of HIV/AIDS and recent diagnosis of varicella zoster encephalitis and cytomegalovirus retinitis, as well as the presence of a gingival mass, suggest that PBL is a likely diagnosis.

The patient's age and the location of the mass in the maxillary gingiva are also consistent with PBL, which tends to affect younger patients and often presents with extranodal involvement, such as in the oral cavity.

The histologic and immunophenotypic features of the tumor, as described in the case, are also consistent with PBL. The presence of a dual population of lymphoma cells, with both plasmablasts and "plasmacytic" cells, is a characteristic feature of PBL. The strong positivity for CD138 and EBV-EBER, as well as the high Ki-67 index, support the diagnosis of PBL.

In contrast, Burkitt lymphoma (choice A) is a more aggressive and malignant form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is less commonly associated with HIV/AIDS. While it can present with extranodal involvement, it tends to affect older patients and has a more aggressive clinical course than PBL.

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (choice B) is a more common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but it tends to affect older patients and is less commonly associated with HIV/AIDS.

* A. Synovial sarcoma: Synovial sarcoma is a rare type of cancer that develops in the soft tissue, usually in the extremities. It is not typically found in the supraclavicular region. The given case's location and the absence of any mention of a synovial sarcoma in the patient's medical history make this option less likely.
* B. Cervical neurilemmoma: Cervical neurilemmoma is a benign tumor that develops from the supporting cells of the nervous system. It is usually slow-growing and painless, but it can cause symptoms due to its size or compression of nearby structures. The given case's location and the patient's symptoms do not match the characteristics of a cervical neurilemmoma.
* D. Pleomorphic adenoma: Pleomorphic adenoma is a type of benign tumor that develops in the salivary glands. It is rare in the supraclavicular region and does not match the given case's characteristics.

In contrast, ectopic hamartomatous thymoma is a rare benign tumor that develops from the thymus gland, which is located in the mediastinum. It can occur in various locations, including the supraclavicular region. The patient's symptoms and the tumor's characteristics, such as its size, location, and histopathological features, are consistent with an ectopic hamartomatous thymoma.

**Answer**: C. Sinonasal mucosal melanoma

The patient's symptoms and imaging findings are consistent with a sinonasal mucosal melanoma. The patient's right-sided nasal congestion and intermittent epistaxis are common symptoms of sinonasal malignancies. The mass found on examination and biopsied at the outside institution, along with the opacification of the right nasal cavity and sinuses on CT scan, are also consistent with a sinonasal malignancy.

The histopathologic analysis, which revealed sheets of atypical, pleomorphic epithelioid cells, some with prominent pigment, is also consistent with a melanoma. The positive immunohistochemical stains for HMB-45 and S-100 support this diagnosis, as they are commonly used markers for melanoma.

Leiomyosarcoma (choice A) is a type of soft tissue sarcoma that can occur in the nasal cavity, but it is less common than melanoma. Olfactory neuroblastoma (choice B) is a rare type of nasal tumor that typically affects the olfactory epithelium and is more commonly seen in younger patients. Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (choice D) is a rare and aggressive type of nasal cancer, but it typically has a more papillary or acinar growth pattern and is less likely to cause unilateral nasal congestion.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, imaging findings, and histopathologic analysis, the most likely diagnosis is sinonasal mucosal melanoma.

**Answer**:A. Administer all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) after consulting a hematologist

The correct answer is A, Administer all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) after consulting a hematologist. This is because the patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). ATRA is a retinoid derivative that is used to treat APL, and it has been shown to be effective in inducing remission in patients with this condition.

Choice B, Administer cytarabine and daunorubicin chemotherapy after consulting a hematologist, is incorrect because while cytarabine and daunorubicin are commonly used chemotherapy drugs for AML, they are not typically used as first-line therapy for APL. In APL, ATRA is the primary treatment, and chemotherapy is usually reserved for cases that do not respond to ATRA or have a high risk of relapse.

Choice C, Perform a bone marrow biopsy, is incorrect because while a bone marrow biopsy can provide valuable diagnostic information, it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are highly suggestive of APL, and initiating treatment with ATRA is the most urgent priority. A bone marrow biopsy can be considered later to confirm the diagnosis and assess the response to treatment.

Choice D, Place a central venous catheter in preparation for replacing blood products, is incorrect because while a central venous catheter may be necessary for the administration of chemotherapy or blood products, it is not the most urgent priority in this case. The patient's life-threatening bleeding and anemia require immediate attention, and initiating treatment with ATRA is the most appropriate next step.

**Answer**:B. Pheochromocytoma; proceed with imaging studies.

The patient's symptoms of chronic paroxysmal palpitations, flushing, pale complexion, and diaphoresis are consistent with a possible diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, a rare tumor of the adrenal gland that produces excessive amounts of catecholamines (such as epinephrine and norepinephrine). The patient's history of stress, left lateral recumbent position, and physical activity possibly affecting her symptoms, as well as her normal blood pressure and lack of a family history of genetic syndromes, also support this diagnosis.

The laboratory results show an elevated urinary metanephrine level, which is a hallmark of pheochromocytoma. Specifically, the 24-hour urinary metanephrine level was 2,151 pg/mg creatinine, which is significantly higher than the normal range of 0-1,100 pg/mg creatinine. This suggests that the patient's symptoms are likely due to excessive catecholamine production.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Pheochromocytoma; proceed with imaging studies. Imaging studies, such as a CT scan or MRI, are necessary to confirm the diagnosis and localize the tumor.

In contrast, the other answer choices are not supported by the patient's symptoms and laboratory results:

A. Adrenocortical carcinoma: This is a malignant tumor of the adrenal cortex that can produce excessive amounts of steroids, but it does not typically cause the symptoms of pheochromocytoma. The patient's urinary metanephrine level is not consistent with adrenocortical carcinoma, which would typically show an elevated 17-hydroxycorticosteroid level.

The correct answer is C because the patient presents with a bleeding oral mass that has been increasing in size over 2-3 weeks, which could be a sign of a potentially malignant or premalignant lesion. The patient's history of bleeding when brushing teeth or eating sharp foods, as well as the friable and pedunculated nature of the mass, further support the possibility of a malignancy.

In this scenario, it is important to prioritize the patient's safety and well-being by referring her to a specialist who can perform a diagnostic biopsy and provide appropriate treatment. An oral surgeon is the appropriate specialist to refer the patient to, as they have the training and expertise to evaluate and manage oral lesions, including biopsy and surgical excision if necessary.

In contrast, the other answer choices are not appropriate for the following reasons:

A. Prescribe a course of prednisone: Prednisone is a steroid medication that is used to reduce inflammation and swelling. While it may be appropriate for certain oral lesions, it is not the appropriate first step in managing a bleeding oral mass that could be malignant. Biopsy and diagnosis should be performed first to determine the nature of the lesion before starting any treatment.

B. Perform a needle biopsy: While a needle biopsy may be a useful diagnostic tool in some cases, it is not appropriate in this scenario. The patient's bleeding symptoms and the friable nature of the mass suggest that a surgical biopsy would be more appropriate to ensure adequate tissue sampling and minimize the risk of bleeding complications.

D. Recommend watchful waiting: Watchful waiting is not appropriate in this scenario, as the patient presents with a bleeding oral mass that could be a sign of a potentially malignant or premalignant lesion. Delaying evaluation and treatment could lead to poor outcomes for the patient. It is important to prioritize the patient's safety and well-being by referring them to a specialist for further evaluation and management.

The correct answer is C. Request a surgical consult for adrenalectomy.

Let's go through each of the answer choices and explain why they are incorrect or correct:

A. Perform a biopsy of the mass: A biopsy may not be the best course of action at this point. While it could provide valuable diagnostic information, it may not be necessary given the patient's lack of symptoms and the already concerning imaging results. Additionally, biopsy carries its own risks, such as infection or bleeding. It would be more appropriate to first consider surgical removal of the tumor, which would allow for a more thorough evaluation of the tissue.

B. Order a repeat CT scan in 3-6 months: Repeating the CT scan too soon may not provide any meaningful additional information, and it may not be necessary to wait that long to take action. Given the size and irregular appearance of the tumor, as well as the marked 18F-FDG uptake, it is reasonable to suspect that the tumor may be malignant. It would be more appropriate to proceed with surgical consultation and planning for adrenalectomy.

D. Perform adrenal magnetic resonance imaging: While MRI may be a useful diagnostic tool in some cases, it is not the most appropriate choice here. The patient has already undergone a CT scan, which provided valuable information about the tumor's size and appearance. Additionally, MRI may not be able to provide the same level of detail regarding the tumor's metabolic activity as PET/CT. Given the patient's symptoms and imaging results, it is more appropriate to proceed with surgical consultation and planning for adrenalectomy.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Request a surgical consult for adrenalectomy. This choice acknowledges the patient's symptoms and imaging results, and it is the most appropriate next step in her care.

Sure! Here's my explanation:

**Answer**: A. Rat bite fever

Rat bite fever is a bacterial infection caused by Streptobacillus moniliformis, which is transmitted through the bite of an infected rat. The symptoms of rat bite fever include fever, chills, headache, myalgias, arthralgias, and a characteristic rash. The rash typically appears 2-5 days after the bite and consists of small, red, flat spots (petechiae) that may form larger patches (purpura) and bleed easily.

In this case, the patient presented with fever, recent falls, leukocytosis, nausea, and arthralgias, which are all consistent with rat bite fever. The patient also had a progressing cutaneous eruption, with scattered petechiae and hemorrhagic vesicles concentrated on the hands and feet, which is also consistent with rat bite fever. Additionally, the patient had palpable purpura across the extremities, which is another characteristic feature of rat bite fever.

The other answer choices are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Rocky mountain spotted fever is a tick-borne illness that causes a characteristic rash, fever, and other symptoms, but it is not associated with petechiae or purpura. Septic emboli are small clots that can form in the bloodstream and cause a variety of symptoms, but they are not typically associated with a rash or the other symptoms described in this case. Disseminated gonococcemia is a serious infection caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which can cause a rash, fever, and other symptoms, but it is typically associated with genital lesions and other findings that were not described in this case.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is rat bite fever.

**Answer**:D. Exophytic Schneiderian papilloma

The correct answer is D. Exophytic Schneiderian papilloma, as it best matches the patient's symptoms and the histopathological findings described in the case.

A. Papillary/exophytic squamous cell carcinoma does not match the patient's symptoms, as it would typically present with a rapidly growing mass that obstructs the nasal passage and causes nasal discharge, bleeding, and facial pain. Additionally, the histopathological description of papillary fronds with slender fibrovascular cores lined by nonkeratinizing squamous epithelium does not fit with the characteristics of squamous cell carcinoma.

B. Verruca vulgaris, also known as a wart, is a benign growth caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). It typically appears as a rough, irregularly shaped bump on the skin and does not match the patient's symptoms of a smooth, exophytic mass in the nostril.

C. Rhinoscleroma is a rare, chronic granulomatous disease that affects the nasal mucosa and is caused by the bacterium Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis. It typically presents with nasal congestion, discharge, and epistaxis, and the histopathological findings include numerous giant cells, neutrophils, and fibrosis. The patient's symptoms and histopathological findings do not match those of rhinoscleroma.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Exophytic Schneiderian papilloma, which is a benign growth that originates from the nasal Schneiderian membrane. It typically presents with a slow-growing, exophytic mass in the nasal cavity, as seen in this patient, and the histopathological findings match the patient's symptoms.

**Answer**:D. Majocchi granuloma

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with Majocchi granuloma, a cutaneous infection caused by the fungus Sporothrix schenckii. The patient's history of wading in a freshwater lake and the presence of crusted papules and pustules on the left leg, which are characteristic of the sporotrichoid spread of the infection, support this diagnosis. The patient's failure to respond to previous treatments for allergic contact dermatitis and cellulitis also suggests that the infection is caused by a fungus rather than a bacteria.

Bacterial folliculitis (choice A) is an infection of the hair follicles, which can cause pustules and crusting on the skin. However, the patient's history and physical examination do not suggest this diagnosis, as there is no mention of follicular pustules or crusting, and the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a fungal infection.

Mycobacterium marinum (choice B) is a slow-growing mycobacterium that can cause skin infections, including pustules and nodules. However, the patient's history of wading in a freshwater lake and the presence of crusted papules and pustules on the left leg do not suggest this diagnosis, as Mycobacterium marinum infections typically occur in saltwater environments.

Sporotrichosis (choice C) is a fungal infection caused by Sporothrix schenckii, which can cause pustules and crusting on the skin. However, this diagnosis is less likely than Majocchi granuloma, as the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are more consistent with a cutaneous infection that is localized to the left leg, rather than a systemic infection that can affect multiple areas of the body.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Majocchi granuloma.

**Answer**:A. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis

Explanation:

A. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) is the correct diagnosis for the patient's symptoms. AGEP is a rare, severe adverse drug reaction that presents with a widespread pustular eruption, typically occurring within 2-3 weeks of exposure to a medication. The patient's history of taking clindamycin 2 days before the onset of symptoms, along with the rapid progression and widespread nature of the rash, are consistent with AGEP.

B. Pustular psoriasis is an incorrect diagnosis as it is a chronic skin condition characterized by recurrent episodes of pustular skin lesions, typically on the scalp, face, and torso. The patient's symptoms do not indicate a chronic condition, and the rapid onset and widespread nature of the rash are not consistent with pustular psoriasis.

C. Deficiency of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist is an incorrect diagnosis as it is a rare genetic disorder that affects the immune system's response to infection. The patient's symptoms do not indicate a genetic disorder, and there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has a deficiency in interleukin-1 receptor antagonist.

D. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome is an incorrect diagnosis as it is a bacterial infection that causes a severe exfoliative dermatitis, typically in children. The patient's symptoms do not indicate a bacterial infection, and there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome.

Therefore, the correct diagnosis for the patient's symptoms is Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP).

**Answer**:C. Brown tumor

The patient's symptoms, such as substernal chest pain, dyspnea, and limited mobility of the right upper extremity, along with the mass involving the right scapula, are consistent with a Brown tumor. Brown tumors are benign, non-neoplastic, reactive lesions that can occur in the bone and soft tissues. They are usually associated with hyperparathyroidism and are caused by an excess of parathyroid hormone (PTH) that stimulates the production of osteoclasts, leading to bone resorption and the formation of giant cells.

The patient's history of hypertension, morbid obesity, fibromyalgia, and obstructive sleep apnea may also suggest an increased risk of developing hyperparathyroidism. Additionally, the patient's previous tonsillectomy and smoking history may also be relevant to the patient's overall health and potential treatment plan, but they are not directly related to the likely diagnosis of a Brown tumor.

Giant cell tumor (choice A) is a benign, but locally aggressive, tumor that typically affects the long bones of the extremities. It is composed of multinucleated giant cells and is usually associated with the presence of a specific genetic mutation. While giant cell tumors can cause pain and limited mobility, they typically do not cause substernal chest pain or dyspnea.

Giant cell reparative granuloma (choice B) is a rare, benign lesion that can occur in the bone and soft tissues. It is composed of multinucleated giant cells and is usually associated with a history of trauma or infection. While it can cause pain and limited mobility, it is not typically associated with hyperparathyroidism or the formation of lytic lesions in the bone.

Metastatic lytic bone lesions of unknown primary (choice D) is a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's age and the presence of a large mass involving the right scapula. Metastatic bone lesions are typically associated with a history of cancer, and the patient's history does not suggest a previous cancer diagnosis. Additionally, the

**Answer**:C. A recurrent herpetic whitlow

The correct answer is C, A recurrent herpetic whitlow, for the following reasons:

A. Foreign body reaction (piece of glove): This choice is incorrect because the case history does not mention any foreign body entering the wound, and the symptoms do not match the typical signs of a foreign body reaction.

B. Osteitis: This choice is incorrect because there is no evidence of bone inflammation in the case history. The patient's symptoms and the physical examination findings are not consistent with osteitis.

D. Bacterial cellulitis: This choice is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are not consistent with bacterial cellulitis. The patient had a negative bacterial culture, and the lesion did not respond to antibiotic therapy.

C. Recurrent herpetic whitlow: This choice is correct because the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a herpetic whitlow. The patient had a history of an unintentional exposure to blood with a blade used to drain an abscess of the oral cavity, which could have introduced the herpes simplex virus into the wound. The recurrence of the soft tissue abscess and the painful vesicle at the same site of the original lesion are also consistent with a herpetic whitlow. The patient's negative HIV and hepatitis B/C virus testing results support this diagnosis, as herpetic whitlow is more common in individuals with a healthy immune system.

**Answer**:B. Refer the patient to a hematology service for possible anticoagulation

Explanation:

The patient presented with bilateral decreased vision during pregnancy, and the fundus examination revealed bilateral hyperemic discs, macular edema, subretinal fluid, and numerous flame-shaped hemorrhages. The patient had a history of type 2 diabetes, which is a known risk factor for vascular complications. The patient's protein S level was decreased, and factor V Leiden testing results revealed heterozygosity in the R506Q mutation, suggesting a possible hypercoagulable state.

In this scenario, it is crucial to consider the potential risk of vision loss due to the presence of macular edema and subretinal fluid. While intravitreous injection of an antivascular endothelial growth factor (Option A) may be a viable treatment option for macular edema, it is not the most appropriate choice at this time. The patient's history of type 2 diabetes and the presence of a hypercoagulable state suggest that the patient may be at risk for further vision loss due to vascular complications.

Referring the patient to a hematology service for possible anticoagulation (Option B) is the most appropriate choice. This will allow for a thorough evaluation of the patient's coagulation status and determine if anticoagulation therapy is necessary to prevent further vision loss.

Observing the patient (Option C) without immediate intervention may lead to further vision loss, as the macular edema and subretinal fluid may worsen over time.

Performing panretinal photocoagulation in both eyes (Option D) may be a necessary treatment in the future, but it is not the most appropriate choice at this time. The patient's hypercoagulable state and the presence of macular edema and subretinal fluid need to be addressed first.

In summary, referring the patient to a hematology service for possible anticoagulation is the most appropriate choice, as it addresses the potential risk of vision loss due to vascular complications and allows for a thorough evaluation of the patient's coagulation status.

**Answer**:A. Cholesterol granuloma

The patient's symptoms of worsening blurry vision and gait instability, along with the physical examination findings of bilateral visual acuity of 20/100 with intact visual fields, and cranial nerves III to XII intact, suggest a possible intracranial mass. The CT scan of the sinuses with image guidance protocol revealed a 5.6 × 2.7 × 2.0-cm, well-circumscribed expansile mass occupying the left petrous apex and sphenoid sinus, which is consistent with a cholesterol granuloma.

Cholesterol granulomas are benign, expansile masses that are usually located in the sphenoid sinus. They are composed of cholesterol crystals and are typically asymptomatic, but can cause symptoms due to mass effect on surrounding structures. The patient's symptoms of blurry vision and gait instability are consistent with the mass effect of the cholesterol granuloma on the surrounding brain tissue.

The MRI findings of a heterogeneous mass on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images, with no enhancement with gadolinium, are also consistent with a cholesterol granuloma. The mass did not displace the internal carotid artery, which is also consistent with a cholesterol granuloma.

The patient's history of cerebral infarct with resultant right lower extremity weakness, and the presence of a cholesterol granuloma, suggest that the granuloma may have been caused by a previous episode of sinusitis or meningitis.

The other answer choices are less likely diagnoses for the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.

B. Mucocele: A mucocele is a benign tumor that arises from the nasal cavity or paranasal sinuses.

**Answer**: B. Extramedullary chronic lymphocytic leukemia

The patient's symptoms of painless left-sided otorrhea, aural fullness, and hearing loss, along with the physical examination findings of a hypomobile left tympanic membrane with an anterior-inferior PET plugged by granulation tissue, and the fine-cut, temporal bone CT scan showing near-complete opacification of the left mastoid air cells and middle ear, are consistent with chronic suppurative otitis media. The patient's history of previous treatment with PETs and ototopical antibiotics, as well as the presence of bloody otorrhea in the month before presentation, suggest that the patient has a chronic ear infection that has not responded to previous treatment.

The patient's history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) that had been treated successfully with chemotherapy and had been in remission for the past 6 years, increases the likelihood that the chronic ear infection is related to the patient's CLL. Extramedullary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (ECL) is a rare complication of CLL that occurs when malignant lymphocytes infiltrate extramedullary sites, such as the spleen, lymph nodes, and other organs. ECL can present with a variety of symptoms, including ear symptoms, and can be difficult to diagnose due to its rarity and non-specific symptoms.

The histopathological findings of numerous, small, basophilic cells that are CD20 positive and CD3 negative, are consistent with a diagnosis of ECL. The positive immunostaining with anti-CD20 antibodies confirms the diagnosis, as CD20 is a marker that is expressed on the surface of B cells, including malignant B cells in CLL. The negative immunostaining with anti-CD3 antibodies rules out the possibility of a T-cell malignancy.

**Answer**:A. Intraosseous meningioma

Explanation:

A. Intraosseous meningioma is the correct diagnosis because it is a type of meningioma that arises within the bone, specifically in the frontal sinus. The patient's symptoms of progressive periorbital edema, proptosis of the left eye, and associated nasal congestion are consistent with an intraosseous meningioma. The imaging findings of extensive thickening of the left frontal bone and a soft-tissue component within the frontal sinus on CT scan, and the markedly hypertrophic bone in the frontal region with a homogeneously enhancing lesion within the left frontal sinus on MRI, are also consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the pathologic evaluation of the removed tissue showed bony spaces containing lobules and whorls of spindle cells, which is consistent with the histopathologic features of meningioma.

B. Mucocele is an incorrect diagnosis because it is a benign tumor that arises from the nasal cavity or paranasal sinuses, and typically presents with nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and/or headache. The patient's symptoms and imaging findings do not support this diagnosis.

C. Fibrous dysplasia is an incorrect diagnosis because it is a developmental disorder that affects the bones and results in the replacement of normal bone tissue with fibrous tissue. While it can cause proptosis and periorbital edema, the imaging findings and pathologic evaluation do not support this diagnosis.

D. Osteosarcoma is an incorrect diagnosis because it is a malignant bone tumor that typically presents with pain, swelling, and limited mobility in the affected limb. The patient's symptoms and imaging findings do not support this diagnosis, and the pathologic evaluation showed no evidence of malignancy.

**Answer**: A. Pseudoaneurysm

A pseudoaneurysm is a rare, false aneurysm that occurs when there is a tear in the wall of a blood vessel, leading to bleeding into the surrounding tissue. This can cause a mass effect and compress nearby structures, leading to symptoms such as pain, swelling, and difficulty breathing. The patient's symptoms of sudden onset of left-sided neck swelling, pain, and progressive respiratory distress, as well as the physical examination findings of trismus, rightward tracheal deviation, and a hoarse voice, are consistent with a pseudoaneurysm.

The fact that the mass was hyperdense on the CT scan and had a density identical to that of the adjacent vasculature suggests that it was filled with blood, which is consistent with a pseudoaneurysm. Additionally, the presence of periapical dental abscesses in two teeth suggests that the patient may have had a bacterial infection that spread to the blood vessels and caused the pseudoaneurysm.

The other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and findings.

B. Parapharyngeal abscess: A parapharyngeal abscess is a collection of pus in the tissue surrounding the pharynx. This can cause symptoms such as neck swelling, pain, and difficulty swallowing, but it would not explain the patient's respiratory distress or the findings on the CT scan.

C. Paraganglioma: A paraganglioma is a rare type of tumor that originates in the paraganglia, which are clusters of cells located near the sympathetic nerve fibers. This type of tumor can cause symptoms such as headache, neck pain, and difficulty swallowing, but it would not explain the patient's respiratory distress or the findings on the CT scan.

**Answer**: D
Explanation:
The correct answer is D, Chorioretinal biopsy, because it is the most appropriate next step in the management of acute syphilitic posterior placoid chorioretinitis (ASPPC).

The patient's symptoms of sudden, painless vision loss in one eye, along with the physical examination findings of bilateral lower leg swelling, rash, and tender lymphadenopathy, suggest a systemic inflammatory condition. The presence of vitritis and a yellowish placoid lesion on the fundus examination, along with the irregular thickening of the retinal pigment epithelium layer with small nodular elevations on optical coherence tomography, are consistent with ASPPC.

A chorioretinal biopsy would be the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis of ASPPC, as it allows for a direct examination of the retinal tissue and can provide a definitive diagnosis. This is supported by the fact that the patient's medical history is significant for human immunodeficiency virus, which increases the risk of opportunistic infections such as syphilis.

The other answer choices are not as appropriate for the following reasons:

A. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain (MRI): While MRI can be used to evaluate the central nervous system, it is not the most appropriate next step in the management of acute vision loss in one eye. MRI may not be able to detect the specific changes in the retina that are characteristic of ASPPC.

B. Systemic antimicrobial treatment: While systemic antimicrobial treatment may be appropriate for the management of syphilis, it is not the most appropriate next step in the management of ASPPC. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a localized ocular inflammatory condition, and antimicrobial treatment may not be effective in treating the underlying cause of the vision loss.

**Answer**:C. Order a lipase level

The correct answer is C. Order a lipase level, as it is the most appropriate next step in the evaluation of this patient's bilateral retinal whitening.

Lipase is an enzyme produced by the pancreas that helps break down fats in the small intestine. Elevated levels of lipase in the blood can indicate pancreatic inflammation or damage, which can lead to vision loss. Acute pancreatitis, a condition characterized by inflammation of the pancreas, can cause bilateral retinal whitening, as seen in this patient. Therefore, measuring the level of lipase in the blood can help support the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis and guide further management.

The other options are not as relevant to the patient's symptoms and diagnosis:

A. Order human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serologies: HIV can cause a variety of ocular manifestations, including retinal whitening. However, there is no indication in the patient's history or examination findings to suggest HIV infection.

B. Order bacterial and fungal blood cultures: While bacterial or fungal infections can cause vision loss, there is no evidence to suggest that this patient has an infection. The patient's symptoms and examination findings are more consistent with a pancreatic disorder.

D. Order antinuclear antibodies (ANA): ANA is a test used to diagnose autoimmune disorders, such as lupus. While some autoimmune disorders can affect the eyes, there is no indication in the patient's history or examination findings to suggest an autoimmune disorder.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation is to order a lipase level to further investigate the possibility of acute pancreatitis.

**Answer**: D. Schedule enucleation with orbital implant

The correct answer is D. Schedule enucleation with orbital implant, as it is the most appropriate treatment option for a pigmented iris lesion that is causing increased intraocular pressure and is suspicious for melanoma.

A. Perform a transvitreal biopsy of the tumor is not the best option, as it carries a risk of tumor seeding and does not provide definitive treatment for the lesion. Biopsy may be considered if the diagnosis is uncertain, but in this case, the clinical appearance and imaging findings are consistent with a pigmented iris lesion, and there is no indication of uncertainty in the diagnosis.

B. Initiate radiation therapy with plaque brachytherapy or proton beam therapy may be considered for small, localized iris melanomas, but it is not the best option for this patient. The lesion is large and has extended into the anterior chamber angle, which may make it difficult to achieve adequate tumor coverage with radiation therapy. Additionally, radiation therapy may not be effective in reducing intraocular pressure, which is a significant concern in this case.

C. Perform iridocyclectomy is not the best option, as it involves removing the entire iris, which may not be necessary for a lesion that is limited to the anterior chamber angle. Additionally, this procedure may not effectively address the increased intraocular pressure.

Therefore, the best option is D. Schedule enucleation with orbital implant, which provides definitive treatment for the lesion and addresses the increased intraocular pressure. Enucleation is the surgical removal of the eye, and orbital implantation involves placing a prosthetic device in the socket to restore the natural appearance of the eye. This option provides the best chance of preserving vision and preventing further complications.

**Answer**:A. The patient is more likely to have a worse prognosis.

The correct answer is A because the presence of an internal tandem duplication (ITD) in the FLT3 gene is associated with a poorer prognosis in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The ITD mutation leads to the activation of the FLT3 receptor, promoting cell proliferation and survival, and is often found in patients with AML who have a higher risk of relapse and lower overall survival. In contrast, choices B and C are incorrect because the length of the duplication and the low mutation burden do not necessarily impact the prognosis. Choice D is also incorrect because while gene sequencing can provide additional information about the mutation, it is not necessary to determine the patient's prognosis based on the FLT3 ITD mutation alone.

**Answer**:C. Perform DIF evaluation of the skin biopsy sample

Explanation:

The patient's symptoms and history suggest a possible autoimmune or immune-mediated disorder, such as cutaneous vasculitis or lupus erythematosus. A skin biopsy was performed, which showed a combination of palpable purpura and petechiae extending from the axilla to the lower abdomen, back, and lower extremities.

Option C, performing direct immunofluorescence (DIF) evaluation of the skin biopsy sample, is the most appropriate next step in the patient's workup. DIF is a diagnostic technique that can help identify immune-mediated skin disorders by detecting the presence of antibodies or complement components in the skin. This test can help support a diagnosis of cutaneous vasculitis or lupus erythematosus, which are both characterized by the deposition of immune complexes in the skin.

Option A, checking serologies for hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), parvovirus, and streptococcal infections, may be appropriate in certain cases, but it is not the most relevant test in this scenario. The patient's history of recurrent episodes of diverticulitis complicated by colovesical fistula and the recent surgery suggest a possible autoimmune or immune-mediated disorder, rather than an infectious etiology.

Option B, checking antinuclear antibody (ANA), is a useful test in the workup of autoimmune disorders, but it is not specific to cutaneous vasculitis or lupus erythematosus. ANA is positive in various autoimmune disorders, including lupus, but it may not be elevated in all patients with cutaneous vasculitis.

Option D, prescribing steroids with a slow and prolonged tapering regimen, may be appropriate as a treatment option for certain autoimmune or inflammatory skin disorders, but it should be based on the results of the diagnostic workup, including the DIF evaluation.

Therefore, the correct answer is C, Perform DIF evaluation of the skin biopsy sample.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

**Answer**:A. The patient has a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN).

The patient's presentation of hepatic and portal vein thrombosis, along with her recent surgery and smoking history, suggests a possible diagnosis of Budd-Chiari syndrome. This is a condition where the veins that carry blood from the liver to the heart become blocked or narrowed, leading to blood clots and liver damage.

The laboratory workup revealed a JAK2 V617F mutation, which is a genetic mutation commonly found in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs), such as polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis. The presence of this mutation supports the diagnosis of an MPN, which can increase the risk of blood clots and other vascular complications.

The other answer choices are not supported by the patient's symptoms and laboratory results:

B. Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the production of red blood cells and can cause blood clots and hemolytic anemia. However, the patient's laboratory results did not show any evidence of hemolysis or anemia, making PNH an unlikely diagnosis.

C. Hereditary protein C deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that can increase the risk of blood clots. However, the patient's family history and clinical presentation do not suggest this diagnosis.

D. Hereditary antithrombin III deficiency is another rare genetic disorder that can increase the risk of blood clots. However, the patient's laboratory results did not show any evidence of this deficiency, and her clinical presentation does not suggest this diagnosis.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN), which is supported by the presence of the JAK2 V617F mutation.

D. Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS) with elastosis perforans serpiginosa

The correct answer is D. Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS) with elastosis perforans serpiginosa.

A. Annular elastolytic giant cell granuloma is an incorrect choice because, although it may have a similar appearance, it is a rare condition that is usually associated with smoking and sun exposure. The patient's history of easy bruising since birth and the absence of a family history of similar cutaneous findings make this diagnosis less likely.

B. Granuloma annulare is an incorrect choice because it typically presents as small, flesh-colored or yellowish papules, not as arciform to annular plaques with surrounding skin atrophy. Additionally, the patient's skin atrophy and easy bruising are not consistent with this diagnosis.

C. Porokeratosis is an incorrect choice because it typically presents as small, scaly papules or patches, not as annular plaques with surrounding skin atrophy. Additionally, the patient's skin atrophy and easy bruising are not consistent with this diagnosis.

D. Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS) with elastosis perforans serpiginosa is the correct diagnosis because it is a rare genetic disorder that affects the elastic tissue in the skin, blood vessels, and other organs. The patient's skin findings, including the annular plaques with surrounding skin atrophy, remarkable skin atrophy on the dorsal aspects of her hands and feet, and translucent skin with visible veins, are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's history of easy bruising since birth and the absence of a family history of similar cutaneous findings also support this diagnosis. Elastosis perforans serpiginosa is a variant of vEDS that is characterized by the presence of small, white, atrophic patches on the skin, which are often surrounded by a rim of telangiectases. The patient's skin findings, including the arciform to annular plaques with surrounding skin atrophy, are consistent with this variant.

**Answer**:B. Umbilical mucosal polyp

The correct answer is B. Umbilical mucosal polyp.

The patient's symptoms, such as a red, bleeding umbilical mass that has been present since the loss of the umbilical stump, and the fact that it bleeds easily with Valsalva maneuver or trauma, suggest that the lesion is likely to be a vascular malformation. The shave biopsy specimen shows an ulcerated epidermis, colonic mucosa, and granulation tissue, which is consistent with an umbilical mucosal polyp.

Pyogenic granuloma (choice A) is a benign vascular tumor that can occur in the umbilical region, but it typically presents as a small, red, pedunculated lesion and does not have the same histopathological features as seen in this case.

Umbilical hernia (choice C) is a protrusion of abdominal contents through a defect in the abdominal wall near the umbilicus. While it can present with a bleeding mass, the presence of an ulcerated epidermis and colonic mucosa on biopsy suggests that this is not an umbilical hernia.

Patent urachus (choice D) is a congenital anomaly where the urachus, a tube that connects the bladder to the umbilicus during fetal life, fails to close after birth. It can present with a bleeding mass, but the histopathological features of the shave biopsy specimen do not support this diagnosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Umbilical mucosal polyp.

**Answer**: C. Amyloidosis

The patient's symptoms, such as purpura, ecchymoses, anorexia, and weight loss, along with the physical examination findings of waxy yellow papules and plaques with purpura in the periocular, neck, axillary, trunk, and inguinal regions, are consistent with a diagnosis of amyloidosis. The patient's history of alcohol abuse and cognitive impairment also support this diagnosis, as these are common risk factors for amyloidosis.

The patient's laboratory results, including anemia, abnormal liver function test results, and renal impairment with moderate proteinuria, are also consistent with amyloidosis. The patient's serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and immunofixation urine protein electrophoresis test results were normal, which is consistent with the diagnosis of amyloidosis, as SPEP and immunofixation are not specific for amyloidosis.

The punch biopsy specimen showed Congo red staining, which is characteristic of amyloid deposits. The polarized microscopy findings also support the diagnosis of amyloidosis, as the amyloid deposits show apple-green birefringence under polarized light.

The other answer choices are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results. Myeloma (Answer A) is a possibility, but the patient's laboratory results do not support this diagnosis, as there is no evidence of M-protein or free light chain production. Metastatic disease (Answer B) is also a possibility, but the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not suggest a primary malignancy. Leukemia cutis (Answer D) is unlikely, as the patient does not have a history of hematologic malignancy and the skin lesions are not consistent with this diagnosis.

**Answer**:B. Mycotic meningomyelitis

The patient's symptoms of progressive quadriplegia, urinary retention, fever, and bilateral positive Babinski sign, along with the physical examination findings of decreased tendon reflexes, bilateral positive Babinski sign, and multiple enlarged cervical lymph nodes, are consistent with a diagnosis of mycotic meningomyelitis. The patient's history of daily contact with moist earth and the absence of any relevant family history suggest that the infection is likely to be caused by a fungus rather than a bacterium.

The patient's laboratory test results, including a normal total blood T-cell count and a CD4+/CD8+ ratio of 0.89, also support this diagnosis. The cerebrospinal fluid testing results, which showed pleocytosis, elevated protein concentration, and a decreased glucose level, are consistent with meningitis. The absence of organisms on Gram stain or acid-fast bacilli suggests that the infection is caused by a fungus, such as Aspergillus or Candida, rather than a bacterium.

The magnetic resonance imaging findings of multiple intramedullary lesions with enhancement are consistent with mycotic meningomyelitis. The presence of a subcutaneous abscess beneath the pigmentation on the back, as shown in the inset photograph, is also consistent with this diagnosis.

In contrast, tubercular meningomyelitis (choice A) is unlikely given the patient's lack of history of tuberculosis and the absence of acid-fast bacilli on cerebrospinal fluid testing. Neurosarcoidosis (choice C) is also unlikely given the patient's symptoms and laboratory test results, as well as the absence of any evidence of sarcoidosis on imaging studies. Central nervous system lymphoma (choice D) is unlikely given the patient's age and the absence of any evidence of lymphoma on imaging studies.

The correct answer is D. Oral lymphangioma, as it is a benign tumor that can occur in the tongue and other parts of the oral cavity. It is characterized by the proliferation of lymphatic vessels and can cause recurrent, painless masses that can resolve spontaneously, which aligns with the patient's symptoms.

A. Herpes simplex virus infection is an incorrect choice as it typically causes painful ulcers or blisters on the tongue and other parts of the oral cavity, and is not associated with recurrent, painless masses.

B. Mucocele is an incorrect choice as it is a benign tumor that arises from the salivary glands, and typically presents as a slow-growing, painless mass in the mouth, not on the tongue.

**Answer**: C. Sigmoid volvulus

The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with a large-bowel obstruction. The plain abdominal radiograph shows a huge colonic distension, which is consistent with a sigmoid volvulus. The "coffee-bean-like" or "bent inner tube" sign visible on the radiograph is a characteristic feature of sigmoid volvulus and indicates that the sigmoid colon has twisted around its mesentery.

The computed tomography scan with multiplanar reconstruction also supports the diagnosis of sigmoid volvulus, as it shows a circumferential thickening of the sigmoid colon wall, which is consistent with edema and inflammation caused by the volvulus.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Cecal volvulus: While volvulus can occur in the cecum, the patient's symptoms and examination findings are not consistent with cecal volvulus. The patient has signs of large-bowel obstruction, which is more consistent with a sigmoid volvulus.

B. Aerophagia: Aerophagia is a condition in which air enters the digestive tract, causing abdominal distension and other symptoms. However, the patient's symptoms and examination findings are not consistent with aerophagia. The patient has a distended abdomen, tenderness, and guarding, which are more consistent with a large-bowel obstruction.

D. Colonic ileus/colonic pseudoobstruction (Ogilvie syndrome): Colonic ileus, also known as Ogilvie syndrome, is a condition in which there is a decrease in the frequency and amplitude of colonic contractions, leading to a functional obstruction. However, the patient's symptoms and examination findings are not consistent with colonic ileus/pseudoobstruction. The patient has a distended abdomen, tenderness, and guarding, which are more consistent with a mechanical obstruction, such as sigmoid volvulus.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Sigmoid volvulus.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain why C. Phytobezoar is the correct answer and why the other choices are incorrect.

**Answer**: C. Phytobezoar

A phytobezoar is a type of intestinal obstruction caused by the accumulation of undigested plant material, such as fruit seeds, pits, or leaves. The patient's symptoms of sudden, severe epigastric pain, failure to pass stool or flatus, and the presence of air-fluid levels on the upright abdominal plain radiograph are consistent with a small-bowel obstruction. The contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan showing a focal area of mixed fat density involving the distal small bowel, with adjacent mesenteric fat stranding, is also consistent with a phytobezoar.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

B. Small-bowel intussusception secondary to pelvic adhesions: Intussusception is a type of bowel obstruction that occurs when a segment of bowel telescopes into another segment. While it is a possible cause of bowel obstruction, it is not the most likely diagnosis in this case, given the patient's symptoms and imaging findings. The presence of air-fluid levels on the upright abdominal plain radiograph and the lack of a mass on the CT scan make intussusception less likely.

A. Metastatic lung cancer: While the patient's history of heavy smoking and the presence of bilateral lung nodules on the CT scan suggest a possible diagnosis of lung cancer, there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has metastatic lung cancer. The patient's symptoms and imaging findings are more consistent with a bowel obstruction.

D. Endometriosis: Endometriosis is a condition in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside of the uterus. While it can cause bowel symptoms, it is not a likely diagnosis in this case, given the patient's age and the absence of any gynecological symptoms.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Phytobezoar.

**Answer**:B. Transposition of the RCA from the pulmonary artery to the aorta

The patient in the given case has a history of hypertension and presented with irregular heartbeats, which were found to be premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) on electrocardiogram (ECG) and Holter monitoring. The patient also had a positive treadmill exercise stress test, indicating the presence of coronary artery disease. Cardiac catheterization revealed a medium-sized area of moderate stress-induced ischemia throughout the right coronary artery (RCA) territory.

The correct answer, B. Transposition of the RCA from the pulmonary artery to the aorta, is the best option for several reasons:

1. Anatomical variation: The patient has an unusual anatomical variation where the RCA arises from the pulmonary artery instead of the aorta. This variation is likely the cause of the patient's symptoms and ischemia. Transposing the RCA from the pulmonary artery to the aorta would normalize the blood flow and alleviate the patient's symptoms.
2. Ischemia: The patient has a medium-sized area of moderate stress-induced ischemia throughout the RCA territory. Transposing the RCA would ensure that the affected area receives adequate blood flow during exercise and other physiological stress, reducing the risk of future cardiac events.
3. Technical feasibility: Transposing the RCA is a technically feasible procedure that can be performed during a coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. The patient's age and medical history do not pose a significant risk for surgical complications.
4. Long-term benefits: Transposing the RCA would provide long-term benefits to the patient by reducing the risk of future cardiac events, improving symptoms, and enhancing quality of life.

The other options are not as appropriate for the following reasons:

A. Medical therapy with β-blocker, nifedipine, long-acting nitrate, and flecainide acetate: While medical therapy can help manage symptoms and reduce the risk of cardiac events, it

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is C: The marked discordance between the direct and calculated LDL levels is related to the effects of very LDL (VLDL), intermediate-density LDL (IDL), and/or Lp(a).

Let's go through each answer choice and explain why it's incorrect or correct:

A: The marked discordance between the direct and calculated LDL levels is the result of a laboratory error.

This answer choice is incorrect because the laboratory error would not cause a consistent discordance between the direct and calculated LDL levels over time. The patient had multiple measurements of LDL-C, Apo B, and Lp(a) over several years, and the discordance between direct and calculated LDL-C levels persisted, which suggests that the cause is not a laboratory error.

B: The patient has familial dysbetalipoproteinemia (type III hyperlipidemia).

This answer choice is incorrect because the patient's medical history and lipid profile do not suggest familial dysbetalipoproteinemia. The patient has a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and gastroesophageal reflux disease, but there is no mention of a family history of hyperlipidemia or any symptoms suggestive of familial dysbetalipoproteinemia. Additionally, the patient's LDL-C levels are not consistent with familial dysbetalipoproteinemia, which typically presents with much higher LDL-C levels.

D: The marked discordance between the direct and calculated LDL levels is the result of excess VLDL cholesterol only.

This answer choice is incorrect because the discordance between direct and calculated LDL-C levels is not solely due to excess VLDL cholesterol. The patient's VLDL-C levels are not unusually high, and the Apo B and Lp(a) levels are also elevated, suggesting that the discordance is related to the effects of multiple lipoprotein fractions, including VLDL, IDL, and Lp(a).

Therefore, the correct answer is C: The marked discordance between the direct and calculated

**Answer**:C. Biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma

The correct answer is C, Biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma, because it best matches the patient's symptoms and the pathological findings described in the question.

A. Low-grade malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor: This choice is incorrect because, although the tumor has a low mitotic index, it shows infiltrative growth and cranial nerve involvement, which are not typical features of peripheral nerve sheath tumors.

B. Monophasic synovial sarcoma: This choice is incorrect because synovial sarcoma typically affects the soft tissues of the extremities and is rare in the head and neck region. Moreover, the presence of respiratory-type epithelium and S-100 protein immunoreactivity argues against a diagnosis of synovial sarcoma.

D. Glomangiopericytoma: This choice is incorrect because glomangiopericytoma is a rare tumor that typically affects the soft tissues of the extremities and trunk, and is not commonly found in the head and neck region. Additionally, the presence of respiratory-type epithelium and S-100 protein immunoreactivity argues against a diagnosis of glomangiopericytoma.

C. Biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma: This is the correct diagnosis because it is a rare tumor that affects the sinonasal region and exhibits both epithelial and mesenchymal features. The patient's symptoms, such as nasal bridge swelling and intermittent epistaxis, are consistent with a sinonasal tumor. The pathological findings, including the infiltrative growth pattern, cranial nerve involvement, and immunoreactivity for S-100 protein and smooth muscle markers, support the diagnosis of biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma.

**Answer**: A. Plasmacytoma

The correct answer is A. Plasmacytoma because it is a type of benign tumor that can occur in the bone and has a characteristic appearance on MRI. Plasmacytoma is a rare, benign tumor that arises from the plasma cells, which are a type of white blood cell found in the bone marrow. It typically affects the bones of the skull, facial bones, and long bones of the arms and legs.

The MRI findings described in the question, such as a mass lying on the anterior surface of the eroded left mandibular condyle with homogeneous isointensity relative to skeletal muscle, are consistent with a plasmacytoma. The postcontrast T1-weighted image with fat suppression showing homogeneous, avid enhancement of the mass and the T2-weighted image showing homogeneous moderately hyperintense signal are also consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the diffusion-weighted image showing marked diffusion restriction supports the diagnosis of a plasmacytoma.

Ameloblastoma (choice B) is a type of benign tumor that arises from the epithelial cells of the odontogenic apparatus and is typically found in the jaw. It has a different MRI appearance than plasmacytoma, with a multilocular, expansile mass that can cause bone expansion and displacement.

Osteosarcoma (choice C) is a type of malignant bone tumor that can arise in the mandible, but it typically has a different MRI appearance than plasmacytoma, with a more aggressive and expansile mass that can cause bone destruction and soft tissue extension.

Venous malformation (choice D) is a type of vascular anomaly that can occur in the head and neck, but it typically has a different MRI appearance than plasmacytoma, with a multilocular, serpiginous or sponge-like pattern.

Therefore, based on the MRI findings described in the question, the most likely diagnosis is plasmacytoma.

**Answer**: C. Acinic cell carcinoma

The correct answer is C. Acinic cell carcinoma because it matches the histopathologic findings described in the question. The tumor is composed of a mixture of dark, granular, basophilic acinar cells and eosinophilic intercalated ductal cells, which is consistent with the characteristic histopathologic features of acinic cell carcinoma. Additionally, the presence of periodic acid-Schiff-positive, diastase-resistant intracytoplasmic granules in the acinar cells and the formation of small ductlike structures by the ductal cells are also consistent with acinic cell carcinoma.

On the other hand, the other answer choices do not match the histopathologic findings described in the question.

A. Pleomorphic adenoma: This is a benign salivary gland tumor that can arise in various salivary glands, including the parotid gland. However, it is not characterized by the mixture of acinar and ductal cells, as seen in acinic cell carcinoma. Instead, it is composed of a mixture of epithelial and myoepithelial cells, with a variable degree of pleomorphism.

B. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma: This is a malignant salivary gland tumor that can arise in various salivary glands, including the parotid gland. However, it is characterized by a different histopathologic pattern, with a mixture of cuboidal or columnar cells with mucin production, and eosinophilic cells with clear cytoplasm. The presence of peripheral cystic spaces and focal areas of hemorrhage, as described in the question, are not typical of mucoepidermoid carcinoma.

**Answer**: B. Rhabdomyosarcoma

The correct answer is B. Rhabdomyosarcoma because it is a type of cancer that originates in the soft tissues of the body, such as muscles, tendons, and connective tissue. The patient's symptoms of a mass in the right anterior nasal cavity invading the right orbit and right ethmoidal sinus, with extension to the overlying soft-tissue scalp, are consistent with a diagnosis of Rhabdomyosarcoma. The patient's age also fits the demographic for this type of cancer, as it typically affects children and young adults.

A. Esthesioneuroblastoma is a type of cancer that originates in the nasal cavity and sinuses. While it is possible that this type of cancer could cause similar symptoms, it is less likely given the patient's age and the location of the mass.

C. Ethmoid mucocele is a benign tumor that originates in the nasal cavity and sinuses. While it is possible that this type of tumor could cause similar symptoms, it is less likely given the patient's age and the aggressive nature of the mass.

D. Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma is a type of cancer that originates in the nasal cavity and sinuses. While it is possible that this type of cancer could cause similar symptoms, it is less likely given the patient's age and the location of the mass.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and demographics, the most likely diagnosis is B. Rhabdomyosarcoma.

**Answer**:C. Perform a lumbar puncture with opening pressure, routine chemistry, and cell count analysis

**Explanation**:

A. Observe the patient and treat headaches conservatively: This choice is incorrect because the patient's symptoms of blurry vision, nausea, and paresthesia in her hands, along with the physical examination findings of bilateral optic disc swelling and unilateral macular exudates, subretinal fluid, and subretinal hemorrhages, suggest a more serious underlying condition that requires further evaluation and treatment beyond conservative management of headaches.

B. Consult surgery for immediate surgical intervention: This choice is incorrect because while surgical intervention may be necessary in some cases of optic disc swelling and macular edema, it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's management. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a possible diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), which is a medical condition that requires further evaluation and management by a neurologist or ophthalmologist before considering surgery.

D. Begin treatment with high-dose corticosteroids: This choice is incorrect because corticosteroids are not the first-line treatment for IIH. While corticosteroids may be used in some cases of IIH, they are typically used after other treatments have failed, and their use should be carefully individualized based on the patient's response to other treatments and the presence of any complications.

C. Perform a lumbar puncture with opening pressure, routine chemistry, and cell count analysis: This choice is correct because a lumbar puncture is a diagnostic test that can help confirm the diagnosis of IIH by measuring the opening pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and evaluating the chemistry and cell count of the CSF. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a possible diagnosis of IIH, and a lumbar puncture is a relatively low-risk and non-invasive test that can help support this diagnosis and guide further management.

**Answer**:B. Thorough ocular adnexal evaluation with eyelid eversion

The patient's symptoms and clinical findings indicate an unusual corneal degeneration, characterized by subepithelial deposits and neovascularization. The deposits are located in the superior cornea, extending towards the visual axis, which may affect the patient's visual acuity.

Option B, thorough ocular adnexal evaluation with eyelid eversion, is the most appropriate next step in management. This is because the patient's symptoms and clinical findings suggest a possible underlying systemic or ocular surface disease that may be contributing to the corneal degeneration. A thorough evaluation of the ocular adnexa, including eyelid eversion, may help identify any underlying conditions that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms.

Option A, crescent-shaped lamellar keratoplasty, is not the most appropriate next step. While this surgical procedure may be considered for advanced corneal degeneration, it is not the first line of management for a patient with early-stage disease. Moreover, the patient's visual acuity is still relatively good, and it is important to first determine the underlying cause of the degeneration before considering surgical intervention.

Option C, subconjunctival injection of anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) medication, may be considered in cases of corneal neovascularization. However, in this case, the patient's neovascularization is not yet severe, and it is unclear whether anti-VEGF therapy would be effective in halting disease progression. Moreover, the patient's symptoms and clinical findings suggest a possible underlying condition that may need to be addressed before considering anti-VEGF therapy.

Option D, refraction with rigid gas permeable contact lens fitting, may be appropriate for patients with refractive errors, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management for this patient. The patient's symptoms and clinical findings suggest a more complex underlying condition that requires further evaluation and management before considering refraction and contact lens fitting.

**Answer**:B. Rechallenge the patient in 12 months with zoledronic acid and manage reactively if uveitis recurs.

The correct answer is B because the patient's symptoms of bilateral ocular pain and hyperemia are likely related to the zoledronic acid infusion. Rechallenging the patient with the same medication in 12 months will allow for monitoring of the patient's response and management of any recurrent uveitis.

Option A, advising the patient's endocrinologist to request an alternative to a bisphosphonate, is not the best answer because it does not take into account the possibility that the patient's symptoms are related to the zoledronic acid infusion.

Option C, preemptively treating the patient before his next dose of zoledronic acid, is not the best answer because it assumes that the patient's symptoms are definitely related to the medication, and it may not be necessary to treat the patient before the next dose.

Option D, treating the problem as an unrelated idiopathic uveitis, is not the best answer because it does not take into account the timing of the patient's symptoms in relation to the zoledronic acid infusion. It is more likely that the symptoms are related to the medication rather than an unrelated condition.

**Answer**: D. Perform aggressive debridement of the eyelids in the operating room and give intravenous antibiotics

The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a severe infection of the eyelids, with extensive swelling, erythema, and blistering. The patient's history of a recent fall and the presence of a small eyelid laceration suggest that the infection may have entered through a break in the skin. The patient's age and comorbidities, such as diabetes and hypertension, also increase the risk of complications from the infection.

Option C, perform bedside incision and drainage of the blisters and admit for intravenous antibiotics, may be appropriate for some cases of eyelid cellulitis, but it may not be sufficient for this patient's severe infection. The patient's extensive swelling and blistering suggest that a more aggressive debridement may be necessary to remove all of the infected tissue. Additionally, the patient's age and comorbidities increase the risk of complications from the procedure, making close monitoring in the operating room and the use of intravenous antibiotics necessary.

Option A, begin oral antibiotics and discharge home with follow-up the next day, is not appropriate for this patient's severe infection. Oral antibiotics may not be sufficient to treat the infection, and discharging the patient home without close monitoring may increase the risk of complications.

Option B, admit for intravenous antibiotics, may be appropriate for some cases of eyelid cellulitis, but it does not address the need for debridement of the infected tissue. Intravenous antibiotics may help to treat the infection, but they will not remove the infected tissue, which can lead to further complications.

Therefore, option D, perform aggressive debridement of the eyelids in the operating room and give intravenous antibiotics, is the most appropriate choice for this patient's severe eyelid infection.

**Answer**:C. Osteosarcoma metastasis

The patient's history of multiple cancers, including high-grade osteosarcoma of the tibia with areas of leiomyosarcoma, and squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, increases the likelihood of a metastatic lesion in the thyroid gland. The patient's age and lack of symptoms such as dysphagia, dyspnea, or weight loss also support this diagnosis.

The CT scan findings of a calcified left thyroid lobe mass and increased uptake on PET-CT imaging are consistent with a metastatic lesion. The positive immunostain results for vimentin and smooth muscle actin and negative results for S-100, TTF-1, and CD34 support the diagnosis of osteosarcoma metastasis, as osteosarcoma cells typically express vimentin and smooth muscle actin but not S-100 or TTF-1.

Thyroid lymphoma (choice A) is unlikely given the patient's history of multiple cancers and the absence of symptoms such as neck swelling, fever, or weight loss. Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (choice B) is also unlikely due to the patient's age and lack of symptoms, as well as the absence of any thyroid function abnormalities. Squamous cell carcinoma metastasis (choice D) is less likely than osteosarcoma metastasis given the patient's history of osteosarcoma and the immunostain results.

The correct answer is C. Order antinuclear antibody, anti-Ro/SS-A, and anti-La/SS-B antibody testing for both the infant and his mother.

The patient's symptoms of fever, facial rash, and anemia suggest a possible autoimmune disorder, such as neonatal lupus erythematosus (NLE). NLE is a rare condition that occurs when maternal autoantibodies cross the placenta and affect the fetus. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including skin rashes, fever, and anemia.

The laboratory results support this diagnosis, as the patient's white blood cell count and platelet count are abnormal, and his C-reactive protein level is elevated. Additionally, the presence of annular erythematous plaques with central atrophy and raised margins on the forehead and periorbital areas is consistent with the skin lesions associated with NLE.

Therefore, it is important to order antinuclear antibody, anti-Ro/SS-A, and anti-La/SS-B antibody testing for both the infant and his mother to confirm the diagnosis of NLE. These tests can help identify the presence of autoantibodies in the mother's bloodstream, which would support the diagnosis of NLE in the infant.

The other choices are not appropriate for the following reasons:

A. Provide education on proper facial cleansing and moisturizing: While this may be appropriate for some skin conditions, it is not relevant to the patient's symptoms of fever, facial rash, and anemia, which suggest a more serious underlying condition.

B. Administer topical antifungals: The patient's skin lesions are not consistent with a fungal infection, and administering topical antifungals would not address the underlying cause of the symptoms.

D. Order a serologic test for syphilis for the infant: While syphilis can cause skin lesions, the patient

**Answer**: C. Cutaneous malakoplakia

Cutaneous malakoplakia is a rare condition characterized by the accumulation of macrophages in the skin, leading to the formation of nodules or plaques. It is often associated with chronic inflammation, and can occur in the setting of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), as in this case. The patient's symptoms, including the growth of nodules on the genital and perianal region, ulceration, and yellow-colored discharge, are consistent with cutaneous malakoplakia. The patient's history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and previous bone marrow transplant also increase the likelihood of this diagnosis.

A. Atypical mycobacterial infection: While mycobacterial infections can cause cutaneous nodules, the patient's history and physical examination findings do not suggest this diagnosis. The patient has no history of exposure to mycobacteria, and the nodules are not typical of mycobacterial infections. Additionally, the patient's blood tests did not reveal any abnormalities consistent with mycobacterial infection.

B. Cryptococcosis: Cryptococcosis is a fungal infection that can cause cutaneous lesions, but it is unlikely in this case. The patient has no history of exposure to cryptococcus, and the physical examination findings do not suggest this diagnosis. The patient's blood tests did not reveal any abnormalities consistent with cryptococcosis.

D. Calcinosis cutis: Calcinosis cutis is a condition characterized by the deposition of calcium salts in the skin, leading to the formation of nodules or plaques. While it can occur in the setting of GVHD, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest this diagnosis. The patient's history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and previous bone marrow transplant also decrease the likelihood of this diagnosis.

**Answer**: C. Pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia

The correct answer is C. Pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia because it best matches the clinical and histological features described in the case.

Pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia is a benign condition characterized by a proliferation of stratified squamous epithelium, often in response to chronic inflammation or injury. The histological features of pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia include a thickened epidermis with irregular acanthosis, papillomatosis, and prominent rete ridges.

In this case, the patient presented with mildly pruritic verrucous nodules in several areas of a polychromatic tattoo on her right lower leg and foot. The nodules were restricted to areas where the artist created pink zones by layering white ink over red ink. The histologic reaction pattern from the punch biopsy specimen showed a thickened epidermis with irregular acanthosis, papillomatosis, and prominent rete ridges, which are all consistent with pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia.

The other answer choices do not match the clinical and histological features of the case:

A. Hypertrophic discoid lupus: This is a rare form of cutaneous lupus erythematosus that is characterized by the development of hypertrophic, verrucous, or nodular lesions on the skin. However, the patient did not report any history of skin cancer, and the histological features of hypertrophic discoid lupus are not consistent with the case.

B. Eruptive keratoacanthomas: Eruptive keratoacanthomas are characterized by the sudden appearance of multiple keratoacanthomas, which are small, benign tumors that arise from the hair follicle. However, the patient did not report any history of multiple keratoacanthomas, and the histological features of keratoacanthomas are not consistent with the case.

**Answer**:C. Rowell syndrome

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as the widespread erythematous plaques with superficial desquamation, bullae, and atypical target lesions, are consistent with Rowell syndrome. This is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies, which can cause a severe and widespread rash, including bullae and target lesions. The patient's history of systemic lupus erythematosus and positive anti-Smith, anti-ribonucleoprotein, and SSA/anti-Ro antibodies support this diagnosis.

Pemphigus erythematosus (choice A) is an autoimmune blistering disease that can cause similar skin lesions, but it is unlikely in this case because the patient does not have the characteristic histopathological features of pemphigus, such as acantholysis and blisters.

Generalized fixed drug eruption (choice B) is a severe cutaneous adverse reaction to a medication, which can cause widespread skin lesions, but it is unlikely in this case because the patient does not have a history of recent medication use, and the lesions do not have the characteristic morphology of a fixed drug eruption.

Toxic epidermal necrolysis (choice D) is a severe and life-threatening skin condition caused by a severe immune reaction, which can cause widespread skin necrosis and blisters. However, it is unlikely in this case because the patient does not have the characteristic features of toxic epidermal necrolysis, such as widespread skin necrosis, and the presence of bullae and target lesions suggests a different diagnosis.

**Answer**: D. X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease 1

The patient's symptoms of recurrent, transient episodes of dysarthria, dysphagia, and limb weakness, along with the physical examination findings of cavus feet, diminished muscle tone, and bilateral positive Babinski signs, are consistent with a neurological disorder affecting the lower motor neurons. The patient's history of recurrent episodes and the absence of any significant family history or other medical conditions suggest a diagnosis of X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease 1 (CMT1), which is a hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy.

The patient's cerebral MRI showing abnormal bilateral increases in T2 signal and diffusion restriction in the periventricular areas and the splenium of corpus callosum, and the significant reduction of the abnormal signal on MRI 3 months later, are consistent with the diagnosis of CMT1. The extensive bilateral nerve conduction abnormalities and significantly reduced motor nerve conduction velocity in the median nerves also support this diagnosis.

The other choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and examination findings.

A. Transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a temporary interruption of blood flow to a part of the brain, which can cause similar symptoms to CMT1, but it is unlikely in this case given the patient's age and the absence of any significant risk factors for TIA.

B. Demyelinating disease (multiple sclerosis or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis) can also cause similar symptoms, but the patient's history of recurrent episodes and the absence of any significant family history or other medical conditions make it less likely. Additionally, the MRI findings are not typical of demyelinating disease.

C. Periodic paralysis is a rare condition characterized by recurrent episodes of muscle weakness, but it is unlikely in this case given the patient's age and the absence of any significant family history or other medical conditions.

D. X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease 1 is the most likely diagnosis, given the patient

**Answer**:B. Ocular neuromyotonia of the third nerve

The patient's symptoms of intermittent diplopia, mild right ptosis, and mildly restricted supraduction, adduction, and infraduction of the right eye, along with the marked restriction of elevation, depression, and abduction in the right eye after eccentric gaze, are consistent with a diagnosis of ocular neuromyotonia of the third nerve. This is a condition where there is a sudden, brief spasm of the extraocular muscles, which can cause double vision. The fact that the patient's symptoms have been present for several years and have not changed significantly over time, suggests that this is a chronic condition. Additionally, the absence of any other neurological symptoms, such as headache, ocular or periorbital pain, or deficits in axial or appendicular strength, rapid fatigability, or dysphagia, supports this diagnosis.

The other options are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms:

A. A recent contrast-enhanced brain magnetic resonance image showed a stable intracanalicular vestibular schwannoma on the left, which had been monitored for 8 years. While this could potentially cause some neurological symptoms, it is unlikely to cause the specific symptoms described in this case, such as intermittent diplopia and mild ptosis.

C. Giant cell arteritis is a condition that causes inflammation of the blood vessels, which can lead to symptoms such as headache, fever, and visual disturbances. However, the patient's symptoms do not suggest this condition, as there is no mention of headache or fever, and the visual disturbances described are not consistent with giant cell arteritis.

D. Cavernous sinus syndrome is a condition that occurs when there is compression of the cranial nerves that pass through the cavernous sinus, which can cause symptoms such as double vision, ptosis, and ophthalmoplegia. However, the patient's symptoms do not suggest this condition, as there is no mention of any other neurological symptoms, such as headache, facial weakness or

**Answer**: C. Fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome

The correct answer is C. Fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) because it matches the patient's symptoms and medical history. FXTAS is a genetic disorder caused by a mutation in the FMR1 gene, which codes for the Fragile X mental retardation protein. The patient's symptoms of progressive action tremor, balance problems, and executive dysfunction are consistent with FXTAS. Additionally, the patient's family history of ischemic heart disease and lack of a family history of neurological disorder also support this diagnosis.

The other answer choices do not fit the patient's symptoms and medical history as well:

A. Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder that affects both the central and autonomic nervous systems. While MSA can cause tremors, it typically affects both sides of the body equally, whereas the patient's tremor is confined to his dominant hand. MSA also causes a range of other symptoms, such as parkinsonism, dysphagia, and pyramidal signs, which are not mentioned in the patient's history.

B. Vascular dementia is a type of dementia caused by cerebrovascular disease. While it can cause cognitive decline and gait disturbances, it does not typically cause action tremors or ataxia. The patient's lack of a history of stroke or other vascular events and the absence of white matter lesions on the brain MRI also argue against this diagnosis.

D. Essential tremor is a common movement disorder that causes tremors, usually in the hands. However, essential tremor typically has a gradual onset and does not affect balance or cognitive function. The patient's sudden onset of severe tremors, balance problems, and executive dysfunction do not fit the typical presentation of essential tremor.

I hope this explanation helps clarify why C. Fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome is the correct answer!

**Answer**: B. Spinal dysraphism

Spinal dysraphism is a congenital abnormality that affects the development of the spine and spinal cord. It can result in a variety of symptoms, including skin changes such as those described in the case. The red patch and soft nodule on the lower back of the neonate, as well as the pedunculated red papule, are consistent with the skin changes seen in spinal dysraphism. Additionally, the fact that the ultrasonography of the spine obtained prior to the visit showed no abnormalities suggests that the skin changes may be related to a spinal cord abnormality, which would be consistent with spinal dysraphism.

In contrast, teratoma (choice A) is a type of benign tumor that can occur in the skin or other tissues, but it is not typically associated with spinal abnormalities. Dermoid cyst (choice C) is a type of benign growth that can occur in the skin or other tissues, but it is not typically associated with spinal abnormalities. Hemangioma (choice D) is a type of benign tumor that occurs in the blood vessels, but it is not typically associated with spinal abnormalities.

Therefore, based on the symptoms described in the case, the most likely diagnosis is spinal dysraphism, which is why choice B is the correct answer.

**Answer**: D. Begin therapeutic plasma exchange

Explanation:
The correct answer is D. Begin therapeutic plasma exchange, because the patient's severe hypercholesterolemia and lipoprotein X (LpX) dyslipidemia are likely caused by a genetic defect that cannot be corrected by medications or biliary stent placement alone. Therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) is a procedure that can help remove the abnormal lipoproteins from the patient's bloodstream, which can help improve her hypercholesterolemia and reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications.

Option A, "Resolve obstructive cholestasis with biliary stent placement," is incorrect because the patient's hypercholesterolemia is not caused by obstructive cholestasis, but rather by a genetic defect that affects lipid metabolism. Biliary stent placement may help improve the patient's jaundice and liver function, but it will not address the underlying dyslipidemia.

Option B, "Begin rosuvastatin, 20 mg per day," is incorrect because rosuvastatin, a statin medication, is not effective in reducing unesterified cholesterol and phospholipids in large lipid-containing particles, which are the main components of lipoprotein X (LpX). Moreover, the patient's high levels of unesterified cholesterol and phospholipids suggest a genetic defect that cannot be corrected by statin therapy alone.

Option C, "Begin therapeutic plasma exchange plus rosuvastatin, 20 mg per day," is incorrect because rosuvastatin, as mentioned earlier, is not effective in reducing unesterified cholesterol and phospholipids in large lipid-containing particles. Adding rosuvastatin to therapeutic plasma exchange may not provide any additional benefit and may only increase the risk of adverse effects.

Therefore, the best answer is D. Begin therapeutic plasma exchange, which can help remove the abnormal lipoproteins from the patient's

**Answer**: A. Middle ear paraganglioma

The correct answer is A, Middle ear paraganglioma, because it best matches the patient's symptoms and the findings described in the question.

A paraganglioma is a type of benign tumor that originates from the paraganglia, which are clusters of cells located near the sympathetic nerve fibers in the body. Middle ear paragangliomas are rare, but they can cause symptoms similar to those described in the question, such as vertigo, hearing loss, and facial nerve weakness.

The patient's history of right-sided hearing loss and the physical examination findings of a mass obstructing the right external auditory canal and House-Brackmann grade 2 facial nerve weakness on the right side are consistent with a middle ear paraganglioma. The patient's symptoms of vertigo, which are episodes of spinning or dizziness, are also consistent with this diagnosis, as paragangliomas can cause pressure on the surrounding structures, including the vestibular system, which is responsible for balance and equilibrium.

The imaging findings described in the question, including the soft-tissue mass emanating from the middle ear involving the facial canal with surrounding bony erosion, are also consistent with a middle ear paraganglioma. The fact that the mass was adherent to the underlying bone and had invaded the facial canal but not the nerve itself is also consistent with this diagnosis, as paragangliomas tend to grow slowly and can infiltrate surrounding structures without destroying them.

The immunohistochemical stains of the specimen, which showed cells positive for synaptophysin with a sustentacular pattern of cells positive for S-100, are also consistent with a diagnosis of paraganglioma. Synaptophysin is a protein that is expressed in neuroendocrine cells, which are found in paragangliomas, and S-100 is a protein that is expressed in sustentacular cells, which are found in the supporting cells of paragangliomas.

The correct answer is D. Oral inverted ductal papilloma.

An oral inverted ductal papilloma is a type of benign tumor that originates from the salivary glands. It is characterized by a proliferation of ductal cells that form a papillary structure, often with a central cavity. The tumor is typically slow-growing and painless, and can occur in various locations in the oral cavity, including the lips.

The clinical presentation of the patient in the case, with a slow-growing, asymptomatic cystic lesion on the lower lip, is consistent with an oral inverted ductal papilloma. The histopathological features described, such as the acanthotic epidermoid epithelium organized in broad papillary folds, with atypia or mitotic figures, are also consistent with this diagnosis.

In contrast, the other answer choices do not fit the clinical and histopathological features of the patient's lesion:

A. Intraductal papilloma: This is a type of benign tumor that originates from the milk ducts and typically affects the breast. It is not commonly seen in the oral cavity, and the histopathological features described in the case do not fit with this diagnosis.

B. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma: This is a type of malignant tumor that originates from the salivary glands and is characterized by a proliferation of epithelial cells that form a variety of patterns, including papillary, acinar, and solid structures. While the histopathological features described in the case do show some similarities to mucoepidermoid carcinoma, such as the presence of mucocytes and an infiltrating border, the lack of atypia or mitotic figures and the well-demarcated borders of the lesion argue against this diagnosis.

**Answer**:B. Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma

The patient's symptoms of left-sided facial pain, fullness, and trismus, along with the physical examination findings of mild tenderness over a mass that extended inferiorly to the zygoma into the buccal cavity and posterolaterally to the left superior molars, and hypoesthesia of the left maxillary division of the trigeminal nerve, are consistent with a juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA). JNA is a rare benign tumor that originates in the nasopharynx and typically affects young males in their teenage years.

The imaging findings also support the diagnosis of JNA. The contrast-enhanced CT scan shows a uniformly hyperdense mass extending into the left infratemporal fossa with slight extension of the mass through the medial aspect of the posterior wall of the maxillary sinus and widening of the sphenopalatine foramen. The contrast-enhanced MRI with fat saturation shows a mass with mild punctuate areas of hypointense signal (suggestive of vascularity) terminating in the left buccinator space with extension into the nasal cavity, maxillary sinus, and inferior orbital fissure. These findings are consistent with the characteristic "salt and pepper" appearance of JNA on imaging.

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (choice A) is a malignant tumor that can affect the nasopharynx, but it is unlikely in this case given the patient's age and the absence of other risk factors. Rhabdomyosarcoma (choice C) is a malignant tumor that can arise in the soft tissues of the head and neck, but it typically affects children under the age of 10. Inverted papilloma (choice D) is a benign tumor that can occur in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses, but it typically presents with unilateral nasal obstruction and does not have the same imaging characteristics as JNA.

**Answer**: A. Venous malformation

The patient's symptoms of intermittent left facial swelling and pain, along with the palpable mass in the left parotid region, are consistent with a venous malformation. The patient's history of malignant hypertension also supports this diagnosis, as venous malformations can be associated with hypertension. The coronal T2-weighted short tau inversion recovery (STIR) image shows a T2 hyperintense lesion measuring 3.7 × 3.4 × 7.4 cm involving the left parotid gland and extending to the left side of the neck, which is consistent with a venous malformation. The absence of a high flow component on the T1-weighted, fat-suppressed, gadolinium-enhanced angiography also supports this diagnosis, as venous malformations typically do not have a high flow component.

B. Lymphatic malformation: Lymphatic malformations are typically associated with congenital anomalies and are less likely to cause hypertension. The patient's symptoms and imaging findings are not consistent with a lymphatic malformation.

C. Arteriovenous malformation: Arteriovenous malformations are characterized by a connection between an artery and a vein, and typically cause high flow rates and early draining veins. The patient's imaging findings do not show evidence of a high flow component, making this diagnosis less likely.

D. Chronic sialadenitis: Chronic sialadenitis is inflammation of the salivary gland, typically caused by a stone or stricture. The patient's symptoms of intermittent swelling and pain are not consistent with chronic sialadenitis, and the imaging findings do not show evidence of a stone or stricture.

**Answer**:C. Continue neuroimaging

The correct answer is C, Continue neuroimaging, because the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a possible neurological cause for her diplopia, such as a cranial nerve palsy or a brainstem lesion. The blurred optic nerve margins nasally, as seen in the fundus photographs, also support this possibility.

Option A, Continue oral antibiotics, is incorrect because the patient's symptoms do not suggest an infectious cause, and oral antibiotics are unlikely to address the underlying neurological issue.

Option B, Refer to neurology department, is incorrect because while a neurology consult may be appropriate, it is not the most urgent step in the patient's management. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a possible emergency, and the ophthalmologist should first ensure that the patient receives appropriate imaging and evaluation before referring her to another specialty.

Option D, Proceed with strabismus surgery, is incorrect because strabismus surgery is not indicated in this case. The patient's diplopia is not due to a strabismus, but rather to a cranial nerve palsy or other neurological cause. Performing strabismus surgery without addressing the underlying neurological issue would not improve the patient's symptoms and may even worsen them.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to continue neuroimaging to further evaluate the patient's neurological symptoms and identify the underlying cause of her diplopia.

**Answer**:C. Electrophysiology

The patient's symptoms of sudden vision loss, blurry vision, and photopsias, along with the physical examination findings of a white ring surrounding the optic nerve, suggest a possible diagnosis of posterior scleritis or uveitis. Electrophysiology testing, specifically electroretinography (ERG), is the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation.

ERG is a non-invasive test that measures the electrical activity of the retina in response to light stimulation. It can help to identify any abnormalities in the retina and can assist in the diagnosis of various retinal disorders, including uveitis and posterior scleritis. In this case, ERG can help to determine if there is any damage to the retina or the retinal pigment epithelium, which could be causing the patient's symptoms.

Treatment with oral prednisone (choice A) may be considered later in the management of the patient's condition, but it is not the most appropriate next step. A full laboratory workup for uveitis (choice B) may also be considered, but it is not as specific or sensitive as ERG in diagnosing posterior scleritis or uveitis. Orbital imaging (choice D) may be necessary later in the management of the patient's condition, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this time.

**Answer**:B. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody testing

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of bilateral vision loss, ear pain, hearing loss, and severe headaches, along with the physical examination findings of afferent pupillary defect, inflamed tympanic membranes, and grade 2 optic disc edema with an inferior disc hemorrhage, suggest a possible diagnosis of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). PRES is a condition that is often associated with hypertension, seizures, and autoimmune disorders.

The laboratory results showing elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rates, along with the cerebrospinal fluid studies showing an elevated white blood cell count and protein level, support the diagnosis of PRES. The magnetic resonance imaging findings of diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement without leptomeningeal enhancement, left-sided mastoiditis, and subtle optic nerve enhancement, are also consistent with PRES.

Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) testing is appropriate in this case because ANCA-associated vasculitis can cause PRES. The presence of ANCA antibodies in the blood can help support the diagnosis of PRES and guide further management.

Quantiferon gold (choice A) is a test used to detect latent tuberculosis infection. While tuberculosis can cause PRES, it is not the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

Rapid plasma reagin (choice C) is a test used to diagnose syphilis. While syphilis can cause PRES, there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has syphilis based on the symptoms and laboratory results.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level (choice D) is not relevant to the patient's symptoms or likely diagnosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is B, Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody testing.

**Answer**:B. Administer systemic steroids and discuss the potential need for long-term immunosuppression for Susac syndrome

Explanation:
The correct answer is B, Administer systemic steroids and discuss the potential need for long-term immunosuppression for Susac syndrome.

The patient's symptoms of bilateral vision loss, hearing loss, vertigo, gait imbalance, and ataxia, along with the physical examination findings of punctate areas of restricted diffusion on MRI and lymphocytosis on lumbar puncture, suggest a diagnosis of Susac syndrome. Susac syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation of the retina, optic nerve, and inner ear, as well as neurological symptoms such as ataxia, vertigo, and hearing loss.

Administering systemic steroids is an appropriate first step in treating Susac syndrome, as it can help reduce inflammation and prevent further damage to the retina and other affected tissues. Discussing the potential need for long-term immunosuppression is also appropriate, as Susac syndrome is a chronic condition that may require ongoing treatment to prevent recurrences.

The other answer choices are not appropriate for this patient's condition:

A. Initiate dimethyl fumarate for relapsing multiple sclerosis: Dimethyl fumarate is a medication used to treat multiple sclerosis, but it is not appropriate for Susac syndrome.

C. Give intravenous acyclovir and intravitreal foscarnet for viral retinitis: The patient's symptoms and examination findings do not suggest a diagnosis of viral retinitis.

D. Observe for acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy: This is a condition that affects the retina and can cause vision loss, but it is not related to the patient's symptoms or examination findings.

Therefore, the correct answer is B, Administer systemic steroids and discuss the potential need for long-term immunosuppression for Susac syndrome.

**Answer**: D. Diaphragmatic rupture and a traumatic rupture of the descending thoracic aorta

The correct answer is D. Diaphragmatic rupture and a traumatic rupture of the descending thoracic aorta.

The patient's symptoms, including hypotension, tachycardia, and decreased respiratory effort, suggest severe injuries. The chest radiograph (Figure 1A) shows an elevated left hemidiaphragm, indicating a possible diaphragmatic rupture. The patient's history of a high-speed motor vehicle collision and the presence of multiple closed long bone fractures also support this diagnosis.

Computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest and abdomen (Figure 1B) confirms the diagnosis of diaphragmatic rupture and also reveals a traumatic rupture of the descending thoracic aorta. This is consistent with the patient's hypotension and tachycardia, as aortic rupture can cause significant blood loss and lead to cardiovascular instability.

Option A, diaphragmatic eventration with lung collapse, is unlikely given the patient's history of a high-speed motor vehicle collision and the presence of multiple closed long bone fractures. While eventration can occur in blunt trauma, it is less common than diaphragmatic rupture.

Option B, pneumothorax with elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, is also unlikely. While pneumothorax can occur in blunt trauma, the patient's symptoms and the CT scan findings are more consistent with diaphragmatic rupture and aortic rupture.

Option C, diaphragmatic rupture and a mediastinal hematoma, is possible but not supported by the CT scan findings. While mediastinal hematoma can occur in blunt trauma, the patient's symptoms and the CT scan findings are more consistent with aortic rupture.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Diaphragmatic rupture and a traumatic rupt

**Answer**: C. Sigmoid endometriosis

The correct answer is C. Sigmoid endometriosis because it aligns with the patient's history of recurrent lower gastrointestinal bleeding, crampy abdominal pain, and diverticulosis without a clear source of bleeding on colonoscopy. Endometriosis is a condition where tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus, and it can cause bleeding and pain. Sigmoid endometriosis specifically affects the sigmoid colon and can cause the symptoms described in the patient's history.

The other answer choices do not align as well with the patient's symptoms and history:

A. Sigmoid adenocarcinoma: While it's possible that the patient could have a malignancy, the patient's history of recurrent bleeding and crampy abdominal pain, as well as the lack of stigmata of recent bleeding on repeat colonoscopy, makes this diagnosis less likely. Additionally, the patient's age and lack of family history of colon cancer also make this diagnosis less likely.

B. Rectosigmoid polyp: A polyp in the rectosigmoid junction could potentially cause bleeding, but the patient's history of recurrent bleeding and crampy abdominal pain, as well as the lack of stigmata of recent bleeding on repeat colonoscopy, makes this diagnosis less likely.

D. Rectosigmoid leiomyoma: A leiomyoma is a benign tumor that can occur in the smooth muscle of the colon, but it's not typically associated with recurrent bleeding and crampy abdominal pain. Additionally, the patient's age and lack of family history of colon cancer also make this diagnosis less likely.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and history, the most likely diagnosis is C. Sigmoid endometriosis.

**Answer**:B. Immune-related hypophysitis

The patient's symptoms of headache, fatigue, and difficulty reading, along with the laboratory results of low ACTH and cortisol levels, suggest a diagnosis of immune-related hypophysitis. This is a known side effect of immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as ipilimumab and nivolumab, which can cause inflammation in the pituitary gland and disrupt hormone production. The MRI scan also supports this diagnosis, as it shows an enlarged pituitary gland with a heterogeneous signal intensity, which is consistent with inflammation.

Option A, brain metastasis, is unlikely given the patient's age and the absence of any other symptoms or signs of metastatic disease. While the patient's headaches could potentially be caused by a brain metastasis, the absence of any other symptoms or signs of metastatic disease, such as seizures, weakness, or cognitive changes, makes this diagnosis less likely.

Option C, pituitary adenoma, is also unlikely given the patient's age and the absence of any other symptoms or signs of a pituitary tumor, such as visual disturbances, hyperprolactinemia, or growth hormone excess. While an MRI scan would be needed to confirm the diagnosis, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not suggest a pituitary adenoma.

Option D, mucocele, is not a possible diagnosis given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results. A mucocele is a benign tumor of the nasal cavity, and would not cause the symptoms described in the case.

**Answer**: D. Advise the patient to discontinue the nutritional supplement

The correct answer is D. Advise the patient to discontinue the nutritional supplement, because the patient's symptoms of yellowing skin on her palms and soles are likely due to the consumption of the nutritional supplement containing beta carotene. Beta carotene is a yellow-orange pigment that can cause discoloration of the skin, particularly in the palms and soles, when taken in high doses or for extended periods.

The other answer choices are not appropriate for the following reasons:

A. Perform a biopsy: A biopsy would not be necessary at this point, as the patient's symptoms and medical history suggest a likely cause of the yellowing skin, and there are no signs of liver disease or other conditions that would require a biopsy.

B. Order repeat liver function tests: Repeat liver function tests would not be necessary, as the patient's initial liver function tests were normal, and there is no indication of liver disease.

C. Empirically treat with a topical steroid: Topical steroids would not be effective in treating the patient's symptoms, as the yellowing skin is not due to a skin condition, but rather to the consumption of the nutritional supplement.

Therefore, the best course of action would be to advise the patient to discontinue the nutritional supplement, which is likely the cause of her symptoms, and monitor her condition to see if the yellowing skin resolves over time.

**Answer**:B. Initiate bortezomib-dexamethasone–based therapy

Explanation:
The patient presented with acute anuric renal failure, which is a sudden and severe loss of kidney function. The patient's history of hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and stage 4 chronic kidney disease suggests that the underlying cause of the renal failure is likely related to chronic kidney disease. The patient's recent strenuous activity and muscle cramps suggest that the acute kidney injury may be caused by a precipitating factor such as acute tubular necrosis or ATN.

The patient's urinalysis showed minimal albuminuria, but a high spot urine protein to creatinine ratio, suggesting that there is ongoing proteinuria. The patient's serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation electrophoresis identified a small monoclonal IgG κ band, and a high serum κ free light chain (FLC) level, which suggests that the patient has multiple myeloma, a plasma cell dyscrasia that can cause renal damage.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, laboratory results, and bone marrow biopsy, the most likely diagnosis is acute renal failure due to multiple myeloma.

Initiating bortezomib-dexamethasone–based therapy is the correct answer because it is a treatment for multiple myeloma that can help reduce the level of M-protein in the blood and urine, and can also help improve renal function. Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor that targets plasma cells and can help reduce the level of M-protein in the blood and urine. Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that can help reduce inflammation and can also help improve renal function.

Continuing IV fluids and administering furosemide (choice A) may help manage fluid overload and hypertension, but it will not address the underlying cause of the renal failure.

Obtaining a renal biopsy (choice C) may provide additional information about the nature of the renal damage, but it

Sure! Here's my answer:

**Answer**: C. Start intravenous quinidine gluconate and doxycycline

Now, let me explain why this is the correct answer:

The patient presents with fever, weakness, fatigue, confusion, jaundice, and scleral icterus, which are all symptoms consistent with malaria. The patient's travel history and lack of malaria prophylaxis suggest that he may have contracted malaria while in Sierra Leone.

The patient's laboratory results also support this diagnosis, with a low white blood cell count, thrombocytopenia, and elevated bilirubin, which are all consistent with malaria. Additionally, the patient's venous lactate level is elevated, which suggests that there may be sepsis or severe malaria.

Given these findings, it is important to start treatment for malaria as soon as possible. Quinidine gluconate and doxycycline are both effective treatments for malaria, and they are often used in combination to ensure that the parasite is fully cleared from the body.

In contrast, artemether-lumefantrine (choice A) is also an effective treatment for malaria, but it is not as effective against severe malaria as quinidine gluconate and doxycycline. Chloroquine (choice B) is not effective against the type of malaria that this patient likely has, as it is resistant to chloroquine in West Africa. Exchange transfusion (choice D) is not a recommended treatment for malaria and may not be effective in this case.

Therefore, the best answer is C. Start intravenous quinidine gluconate and doxycycline.

**Answer**:B. Knee-located EED with a calcaneal late-stage nodular component

The correct answer is B, Knee-located EED with a calcaneal late-stage nodular component, because it most closely matches the patient's symptoms and test results.

Erythema elevatum diutinum (EED) is a rare, chronic skin condition characterized by the development of violaceous plaques on the extensor surfaces of the knees and elbows. The patient's symptoms of multiple, slightly erythematous cutaneous nodules on the calcanea and violaceous plaques on the extensor surface of the knees, bilaterally, are consistent with EED. The patient's age and the duration of the symptoms also align with the typical presentation of EED, which often affects young adults and can persist for months or even years.

The late-stage nodular component on the calcanea is also consistent with EED, as it is not uncommon for patients with EED to develop nodules or papules, especially on the lower extremities. The patient's excisional biopsy specimens (Figure C and D) show features consistent with EED, including a dense infiltrate of lymphocytes, histiocytes, and neutrophils, as well as a prominent dermal infiltrate of collagen.

In contrast, the other answer choices do not match the patient's symptoms and test results as closely:

A. Elastolytic granuloma is a rare condition characterized by the destruction of elastic tissue in the skin, often caused by a hypersensitivity reaction to certain metals. While the patient's nodules may have some elastic tissue damage, this is not the primary feature of their condition, and there is no evidence to suggest a hypersensitivity reaction.

C. Epithelioid sarcoma is a rare, malignant neoplasm that typically affects the skin and subcutaneous tissue. While the patient's nodules may have some features of malignancy, such as a prominent dermal infiltrate, the overall appearance of the nodules and the patient's age and symptoms do not suggest a malignant diagn

**Answer**: A. Kaposi varicelliform eruption

The correct answer is A, Kaposi varicelliform eruption, because it matches the clinical presentation and histopathological features described in the case.

Kaposi varicelliform eruption is a rare, acute, and self-limited skin condition that is often associated with viral infections, such as herpes simplex or herpes zoster. It is characterized by the rapid development of crops of small, painful, fluid-filled blisters on the face, neck, and upper trunk. The blisters typically have a characteristic "cobblestone" appearance and may be accompanied by fever, headache, and malaise.

In this case, the patient presented with an acute, painful eruption on her face and neck, with confluent erythema and keratotic papulovesicles. The presence of honey-colored crusts on the left ear and preauricular area, as well as the occasional red, crusted papules on the chest and inframammary area, are also consistent with Kaposi varicelliform eruption.

The histopathological features shown in Figure B and C are also consistent with Kaposi varicelliform eruption. The full-thickness epidermal necrosis with focal areas of suprabasal acantholysis, corp ronds, corp grains, and parakeratosis are all characteristic features of this condition. The multinucleated cells with nuclear molding and margination seen in Figure C are also consistent with Kaposi varicelliform eruption.

In contrast, the other answer choices do not match the clinical and histopathological features of the case.

Impetigo (choice B) is a bacterial infection that typically presents with crusted, oozing, or weeping lesions on the face, arms, and legs. It is not associated with the characteristic "cobblestone" appearance of Kaposi varicelliform eruption.

**Answer**: D. Leprosy

The correct diagnosis for the patient's symptoms is leprosy, which is a chronic bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium leprae. The patient's symptoms of gradual hair loss, swelling and painful hand joints, and multiple asymptomatic nodules on the skin are consistent with leprosy. The patient's history of no associated fever, analgesia, or hypesthesia, and the absence of any previous infections or family or personal medical history of autoimmune diseases or psoriasis, also support this diagnosis.

The laboratory test results, including a slightly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and significantly elevated rheumatoid factor, are consistent with leprosy. The X-ray and joint ultrasound results, which showed osteoarthritis, synovitis, flexor tendon tenosynovitis, and bone erosions, are also consistent with leprosy. The ultrasound results indicating enlarged axillary, cervical, and inguinal lymph nodes and an enlarged spleen, are also consistent with leprosy.

The skin biopsy results, which showed a diffuse infiltrate of foamy histiocytes in the dermis, are consistent with leprosy. The presence of numerous acid-fast bacilli on acid-fast stain, which is a characteristic feature of leprosy, confirms the diagnosis.

In contrast, rheumatoid arthritis, systematic lupus erythematosus, and arthritis associated with other connective tissue diseases, do not present with the same symptoms and laboratory results as leprosy. Rheumatoid arthritis typically presents with joint pain, stiffness, and swelling, but does not have the same skin manifestations as leprosy. Systematic lupus erythematosus can present with skin manifestations, but they are typically not similar to the skin nodules seen in leprosy. Arthritis associated with other connective tissue diseases, such as psoriasis, can present with joint symptoms, but

**Answer**:A. Trauma-focused psychotherapy

Explanation:
Trauma-focused psychotherapy is the most appropriate choice for this patient because it addresses the root cause of his symptoms, which are related to his traumatic experiences during his military service. The patient's symptoms, such as frequent nightmares, flashbacks, avoidance, and hypervigilance, are classic signs of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Trauma-focused psychotherapy, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or exposure therapy, can help the patient process his traumatic experiences and develop coping strategies to manage his symptoms.

Pharmacotherapy with risperidone (choice B) may be effective in reducing symptoms of psychosis, but it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient's primary symptoms of PTSD. Risperidone has not been shown to be effective in treating PTSD specifically.

Pharmacotherapy with prazosin (choice C) may be effective in reducing symptoms of PTSD, such as nightmares and sleep disturbances, but it is not a comprehensive treatment that addresses the underlying trauma. Prazosin is an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor antagonist that has been shown to reduce symptoms of PTSD in some studies, but it is not a substitute for trauma-focused psychotherapy.

Pharmacotherapy with propranolol (choice D) may be effective in reducing symptoms of anxiety and hypervigilance, but it is not a specific treatment for PTSD. Propranolol is a beta-adrenergic receptor antagonist that has been used off-label to treat anxiety disorders, but it does not address the root cause of the patient's symptoms, which are related to his traumatic experiences.

In summary, trauma-focused psychotherapy is the most appropriate choice for this patient because it addresses the underlying trauma and can help the patient develop coping strategies to manage his symptoms. While medications may be used adjunctively to reduce symptoms, they are not a substitute for comprehensive psychotherapy.

**Answer**: C. Primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease)

The patient's symptoms of postural lightheadedness, worsening fatigue, muscle weakness, salt cravings, loss of axillary hair, and missed periods for 2 months, as well as the physical examination findings of ill appearance, hypotension, hyperpigmentation of the knuckles, distal fingers, and tongue, are all consistent with primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease). This is a condition in which the adrenal glands do not produce enough cortisol and aldosterone hormones.

The patient's history of unexplained intracranial hypertension and bilateral papilledema also support this diagnosis, as these are known complications of Addison disease. The patient's weight loss and decreased body mass index (BMI) are also consistent with this diagnosis, as patients with Addison disease may experience weight loss and muscle wasting.

The other answer choices do not fit the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings as well.

**Answer**: A. Hypervitaminosis A

Hypervitaminosis A is a condition in which there is an excessive intake of vitamin A, leading to toxic effects. While this condition can cause symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, and blurred vision, it does not explain the patient's bilateral papilledema, postural lightheadedness, or hypotension. The patient's weight loss and decreased BMI are also not consistent with hypervitaminosis A.

**Answer**: B. Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS)

POTS is a condition in which there is an abnormal increase in heart rate upon standing, leading to symptoms such as lightheadedness, dizziness, and fatigue. While this condition can cause some of the patient's symptoms, it does not explain the patient's bilateral papilledema, hypotension, or hyperpigmentation of the knuckles, distal fingers, and tongue.

**Answer**: C. Pulmonary valve replacement for severe pulmonary regurgitation

The patient in this case has a history of tetralogy of Fallot, which is a congenital heart defect that includes pulmonary stenosis, ventricular septal defect, and an overriding aorta. The patient has already undergone surgical repair of the defect, but the echocardiogram shows severe pulmonary regurgitation, which is likely caused by a dysfunctional pulmonary valve.

Option C, pulmonary valve replacement, is the correct answer because it addresses the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, which is the severe pulmonary regurgitation. Replacing the pulmonary valve will help to improve the patient's cardiac function and reduce the risk of complications such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and stroke.

Option A, sildenafil for severe pulmonary hypertension, is not the correct answer because the patient's main problem is not pulmonary hypertension, but rather the severe pulmonary regurgitation. Sildenafil is a medication that is used to treat pulmonary hypertension, but it will not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

Option B, balloon valvotomy for severe pulmonary valvular stenosis, is also not the correct answer because the patient does not have pulmonary valvular stenosis, but rather pulmonary regurgitation. Balloon valvotomy is a procedure that is used to treat pulmonary valvular stenosis, but it is not appropriate for patients with pulmonary regurgitation.

Option D, surgical intervention for residual ventricular septal defect, is not the correct answer because the patient has already undergone surgical repair of the ventricular septal defect, and the current problem is related to the pulmonary valve. Surgical intervention may be necessary in some cases, but it is not the most appropriate option for this patient's current condition.

QUESTION: Title: Slowly Growing Right-Sided Neck Mass With Progressive Dysphagia. Case is: A man in his late 40s with a 30-pack-year history of smoking and a history of heavy drinking presented following 7 months of right-sided neck tenderness. He also reported progressive dysphagia to solids but no dyspnea, otalgia, or weight loss. Examination revealed very tender right-sided neck fullness of 6 cm. Laryngoscopic findings were unremarkable. Computed tomography (CT) with contrast demonstrated a 4.4 × 3.6 × 4.5-cm heterogeneously enhancing mass in the right side of the neck, splaying and completely surrounding both the internal and external carotid arteries (Figure, A). Scattered lymph nodes were also observed. On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the mass was hyperintense on T2 (Figure, B). A second 0.9-cm enhancing mass was visualized at the inferior right jugular foramen. Chest radiography demonstrated no suspicious pulmonary or mediastinal lesions. He underwent excision of the mass with right-sided neck dissection. Cranial nerves XI, X, and XII were identified and preserved. During subadventitial dissection of tumor off the carotid bifurcation, a laceration of the internal carotid artery was noted. Vascular surgery was performed to make an intraoperative repair, and an intraoperative angiogram demonstrated no dissections or thrombi. The lesion was suspected to be benign, and the procedure was aborted. The patient experienced no neurologic sequelae postoperatively.

**Answer**: C. Nasal chondromesenchymal hamartoma

The patient's symptoms of respiratory distress, noisy breathing, and nasal congestion, along with the physical examination findings of a mucosalized mass filling the left nasal cavity, suggest a nasal mass that is obstructing the airway. The CT scan and MRI findings of a 2.0 × 1.6-cm mass in the left mid-nasal cavity, compressing the middle turbinate and lamina papyracea, further support this diagnosis.

The patient's age and the location of the mass near the sphenoid sinus and medial to the middle turbinate, also support the diagnosis of a nasal chondromesenchymal hamartoma. This type of hamartoma is a rare benign tumor that typically affects the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses in children and young adults. It is composed of a mixture of cartilage, bone, and soft tissue, which is consistent with the histologic examination findings described in the case.

In contrast, intranasal glioma (choice A) is a rare type of brain tumor that originates in the nasal cavity and would not have the same histologic features as a chondromesenchymal hamartoma. Basal encephalocele (choice B) is a congenital neural tube defect that is characterized by a protrusion of the meninges and brain tissue through a skull defect, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms or imaging findings. Teratoma (choice D) is a type of germ cell tumor that can occur in various parts of the body, including the nasal cavity, but it typically has a different histologic appearance than a chondromesenchymal hamartoma.

**Answer**: D. Chordoma

The patient's symptoms of progressive sore throat, globus sensation, and dysphagia, along with the physical examination findings of a submucosal right retropharyngeal mass extending from the level of the soft palate to the postcricoid, are consistent with a diagnosis of a retropharyngeal tumor. The patient's age and lack of significant medical history also support this diagnosis.

The contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast findings of a T2 hyperintense, enhancing mass in the retropharyngeal and prevertebral spaces with marrow replacement of the C2 vertebral body extending to the odontoid, also support the diagnosis of a retropharyngeal tumor.

The histopathologic findings of sheets and cords of tumor cells with eosinophilic granular, clear, or bubbly cytoplasm on a basophilic myxoid stromal background, and scattered physaliphorous cells, are consistent with a diagnosis of chordoma. Chordoma is a rare type of cancer that arises from the notochord, a structure that runs along the length of the spine and plays a critical role in the development of the spine and spinal cord. Chordoma typically affects the base of the skull, the cervical spine, and the thoracic spine.

The immunohistochemical analysis result positive for brachyury, a protein that is expressed in the notochord and its derivative tumors, further supports the diagnosis of chordoma.

Therefore, option D, Chordoma, is the correct answer.

Option A, Carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma, is incorrect because pleomorphic adenoma is a type of salivary gland tumor that is not typically found in the retropharyngeal region.

Option B, Chordoid meningioma, is incorrect because meningioma is a type of tumor that arises from the meninges, the protective coverings of the brain and spinal cord, and is not typically found in the ret

**Answer**: C. Desmoid tumor

The patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and imaging results are consistent with a desmoid tumor. The mass is firm, immobile, and nontender, which is consistent with the characteristic of desmoid tumors. The MRI findings, including the size, location, and heterogeneous signal intensity, are also consistent with a desmoid tumor. Additionally, the patient's age and the absence of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) mutations support the diagnosis of a desmoid tumor.

Ewing sarcoma is a malignant tumor that can arise in the bone, but it typically affects older children and young adults. Eosinophilic granuloma is a type of benign bone tumor that can have a similar appearance on imaging, but it typically has a more rounded shape and a smaller size. Lymphoma is a malignant tumor that can affect the lymphatic system, but it typically has a different imaging appearance and is not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and imaging results, the most likely diagnosis is a desmoid tumor.

**Answer**:B. Genetic testing for GCG triplet repeats

The patient's presentation of bilateral ptosis with a strong family history of the condition suggests a possible genetic etiology. The patient's family history, with multiple affected relatives across multiple generations, is consistent with an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. The most common genetic cause of bilateral ptosis is the expansion of the GCG triplet repeat in the PHOX2A gene, which is responsible for the development and maintenance of the sympathetic nervous system. This repeat expansion leads to a toxic gain-of-function mutation that affects the function of the PHOX2A protein.

Therefore, genetic testing for GCG triplet repeats (choice B) is the most appropriate next step in the patient's diagnostic workup. This test can confirm the presence of the repeat expansion and establish the diagnosis of hereditary bilateral ptosis.

In contrast, the other choices are not the most appropriate next steps in the patient's diagnostic workup:

A. Ptosis repair by Müllerectomy or levator advancement (choice A): While surgical intervention may ultimately be necessary to address the patient's ptosis, it is not the most appropriate next step. The patient's bilateral ptosis is likely caused by a genetic mutation, and surgery will not address the underlying cause.

C. Treatment with prednisone (choice C): Prednisone is a corticosteroid that can be used to reduce inflammation and swelling. However, it is not indicated in the patient's case, as there is no evidence of inflammation or swelling. Moreover, prednisone will not address the underlying genetic cause of the patient's ptosis.

D. Observation (choice D): Observation may be appropriate for some patients with ptosis, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's strong family history and the presence of bilateral ptosis suggest a genetic etiology, which should be investigated further.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Genetic testing for GCG triplet repeats.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

**Answer**: C. Start prednisone at 80 mg daily with a slow taper

The correct answer is C, Start prednisone at 80 mg daily with a slow taper, because it is the most appropriate treatment for the patient's symptoms. The patient is presenting with blurry vision and frontal headaches, which are symptoms of inflammation in the eye. The fundus examination shows vitreous cells, optic nerve hyperemia, and multiple shallow serous retinal detachments, which are all indicative of inflammation in the eye. The fluorescein angiography also shows optic disc leakage, multiple pinpoint areas of hyperfluorescence, and fluorescein pooling in the areas of serous detachment, which further supports the diagnosis of inflammation.

Prednisone is a corticosteroid that is commonly used to treat inflammation in the eye. It works by reducing the inflammation and swelling in the eye, which can help to improve vision and reduce the risk of further damage. Starting with a high dose of 80 mg daily and slowly tapering the dose over time can help to effectively manage the inflammation and prevent it from returning.

The other answer choices are not appropriate for this patient's symptoms. Surgical decompression of vortex veins (choice A) is not necessary for this patient, as there is no indication of any blockage or obstruction in the veins. Performing B-scan ultrasonography (choice B) may be useful in some cases of eye inflammation, but it is not the most appropriate step in this patient's management. Checking blood pressure (choice D) is not relevant to the patient's symptoms or diagnosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is C, Start prednisone at 80 mg daily with a slow taper.

**Answer**:C. Obtain a complete blood cell count

The correct answer is C. Obtain a complete blood cell count because the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a possible underlying systemic condition that may be contributing to the bilateral retinal hemorrhages. The patient's recent easy bruising and progressive fatigue suggest a possible bleeding disorder or anemia, which could be causing the retinal hemorrhages. A complete blood cell count would help to identify any abnormalities in the patient's blood cells, such as anemia, thrombocytopenia, or leukopenia, which could be contributing to the hemorrhages.

Option A, Obtain an infectious and inflammatory panel, is not the most appropriate choice at this time because there is no evidence to suggest an infectious or inflammatory cause for the retinal hemorrhages. While it is possible that an infection or inflammation may be contributing to the patient's symptoms, it is unlikely given the absence of any other symptoms or signs of infection or inflammation.

Option B, Observe, is not a suitable option because the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a potentially serious underlying condition that requires further evaluation and management. It is important to investigate the cause of the retinal hemorrhages to prevent further vision loss and to ensure that the patient receives appropriate treatment.

Option D, Inject an anti–vascular endothelial growth factor, is not appropriate at this time because there is no evidence to suggest that the retinal hemorrhages are caused by neovascularization or abnormal vessel growth. In addition, anti-VEGF injections are typically used to treat conditions such as age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and retinal vein occlusion, but are not typically used to treat bilateral retinal hemorrhages without evidence of neovascularization.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to obtain a complete blood cell count to help identify any underlying systemic conditions that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms and examination findings.

The correct answer is B. Biopsy.

A. Vitrectomy is not the best next step in this case. While vitrectomy may be necessary in some cases of vitreous deposits, in this case, the patient has a history of breast cancer with brain metastasis, which increases the risk of disseminating tumor cells during surgery. Additionally, the patient's main complaint is blurry vision, which may not be improved by vitrectomy.

C. Observe and manage glaucoma is not the best next step. While managing glaucoma is important, the patient's main complaint is blurry vision, which is not primarily caused by glaucoma. Moreover, the patient has a history of brain metastasis, which requires close monitoring and treatment.

D. Enucleate is not a reasonable next step. Enucleation is a drastic measure that is usually considered in cases of advanced and painful eye cancer. In this case, there is no evidence of eye cancer, and the patient's main complaint is blurry vision, which may be treatable with less invasive measures.

Biopsy, on the other hand, is a reasonable next step. The patient's history of breast cancer with brain metastasis increases the likelihood that the vitreous deposits may be related to the cancer. A biopsy would help to determine the nature of the deposits and guide further management. Additionally, biopsy may also help to rule out other potential causes of vitreous deposits, such as uveitis or sarcoidosis.

Therefore, the best next step would be to perform a biopsy to determine the cause of the vitreous deposits and guide further management.

A. Liver abscess is an incorrect choice because, although the patient has symptoms of fever and abdominal pain, there is no evidence of an abscess in the liver. The CECT scan does not show any signs of liver abscess, such as a round or oval-shaped lesion with a central cavity or a "target sign" appearance.

C. Gallbladder cancer with contiguous liver infiltration is also an incorrect choice. Although the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with gallbladder cancer, the CECT scan does not show any features of gallbladder cancer, such as a mass in the gallbladder or liver, or signs of vascular invasion. Additionally, the patient's age and clinical presentation do not suggest a high likelihood of gallbladder cancer.

D. Necrotic liver tumor is an unlikely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results. The CECT scan does not show any features of a necrotic liver tumor, such as a large, irregular, or heterogeneous mass in the liver, or signs of necrosis or hemorrhage. Additionally, the patient's symptoms of fever and abdominal pain are not typically seen in patients with necrotic liver tumors.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, as well as the findings from the CECT scan, is acute cholecystitis with intrahepatic perforation of the gallbladder.

**Answer**: A. Mucocele of the appendix

The correct answer is A, Mucocele of the appendix, because it best fits the patient's symptoms and imaging results.

A Mucocele is a benign tumor that arises from the appendix, and it is characterized by a cystic mass filled with mucinous material. The patient's symptoms, such as an asymptomatic cystic lesion in the right iliac fossa, and the imaging results, such as a 16-mm cystic lesion in close relation to the cecum, are consistent with a Mucocele of the appendix.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

B. Cecal diverticulum: A diverticulum is a pouch-like structure that forms in the wall of a hollow organ, such as the colon. While a cecal diverticulum could potentially cause symptoms similar to those described in the patient's history, it would not explain the imaging findings of a cystic lesion in close relation to the cecum.

C. Meckel diverticulum: A Meckel diverticulum is a congenital pouch-like structure that forms in the wall of the small intestine, usually near the ileocecal valve. Like a cecal diverticulum, it would not explain the imaging findings of a cystic lesion in close relation to the cecum.

D. Ileal duplication cyst: An ileal duplication cyst is a rare congenital abnormality in which there is a duplicate segment of small intestine. It could potentially cause symptoms similar to those described in the patient's history, but it would not explain the imaging findings of a cystic lesion in close relation to the cecum.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and imaging results, the most likely diagnosis is a Mucocele of the appendix.

The correct answer is C. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor.

A. Solid pseudopapillary neoplasia of the pancreas: This is an incorrect choice because the patient's symptoms and imaging findings do not support this diagnosis. Solid pseudopapillary neoplasms are typically slow-growing and often asymptomatic, and they do not typically cause significant abdominal pain or ascites. Additionally, the imaging findings do not show the characteristic solid-cystic mass with a pseudopapillary appearance that is typical of solid pseudopapillary neoplasms.

B. Atypical mucinous cystic neoplasia of the pancreas: This is an incorrect choice because the patient's symptoms and imaging findings do not support this diagnosis. Atypical mucinous cystic neoplasms are typically slow-growing and often asymptomatic, and they do not typically cause significant abdominal pain or ascites. Additionally, the imaging findings do not show the characteristic mucin-filled cystic spaces that are typical of atypical mucinous cystic neoplasms.

D. Pancreatic pseudocyst: This is an incorrect choice because the patient's symptoms and imaging findings do not support this diagnosis. Pancreatic pseudocysts are typically fluid-filled cavities that do not have a solid component, and they do not typically cause significant abdominal pain or ascites. Additionally, the imaging findings do not show a typical pseudocystic appearance.

C. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor: This is the correct choice because the patient's symptoms and imaging findings are consistent with this diagnosis. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors are a type of sarcoma that can arise in the digestive tract and can cause abdominal pain, ascites, and other symptoms. The imaging findings show a large, heterogeneous mass that appears to originate from the body of the pancreas and protrude into the gastric wall, which is consistent with a gastrointestinal stromal tumor.

**Answer**: C. Instruct the patient to take only the valacyclovir.

The correct answer is C, Instruct the patient to take only the valacyclovir, because the patient's symptoms suggest a viral infection, and valacyclovir is an antiviral medication that is effective against herpes simplex virus (HSV), which is the most likely cause of the patient's rash. The patient's history of a "spider bite" and the appearance of the rash, with vesicles and purulent fluid on an erythematous base, are consistent with HSV infection.

Option A, Perform local incision and debridement, is not appropriate because it is not necessary to surgically remove the rash, and it may even be harmful to do so.

Option B, Admit to the hospital for intravenous antiviral therapy, is not necessary at this time, as the patient is afebrile and does not have any signs of severe illness. Oral antiviral medication, such as valacyclovir, can be effective in treating HSV infections.

Option D, Instruct the patient to take only the clindamycin, is incorrect because clindamycin is an antibiotic, not an antiviral medication. While it may be appropriate to prescribe antibiotics if there are signs of bacterial superinfection, it is not the primary treatment for a viral infection such as HSV.

**Answer**: D. Start anticoagulation and refer the patient for evaluation for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy

The patient's symptoms of increasing dyspnea on exertion and requiring increasing flow rates of oxygen, along with the findings of a prominent pulmonary component of the second heart sound, dilated right atrium and ventricle, and nonocclusive thrombus in the left femoral and popliteal veins, suggest the presence of chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). This is a condition where there is a gradual accumulation of thrombi in the small pulmonary arteries, leading to increased vascular resistance and eventually to right heart failure.

The ventilation-perfusion (V/Q) scan (Figure, panel A) shows a mismatch between ventilation and perfusion, indicating that there is a lack of blood flow to certain areas of the lung, which is consistent with CTEPH. The pulmonary angiography (Figure, panel B) shows a filling defect in the right pulmonary artery, which is consistent with a thrombus.

Given the patient's history of smoking and the presence of a nonocclusive thrombus in the left femoral and popliteal veins, it is likely that the thrombus in the pulmonary artery is also related to smoking.

The best course of action would be to start the patient on anticoagulation therapy to prevent further thrombus formation and to refer the patient for evaluation for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy. This is a surgical procedure that involves removing the thrombus from the pulmonary artery, which can improve lung function and symptoms in patients with CTEPH.

Starting parenteral corticosteroids and nebulized bronchodilators (choice A) may help to reduce inflammation and improve lung function in patients with COPD, but it would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, which is the chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.

Starting heparin treatment followed by an oral anticoagulant for 6 months (choice B) may help to prevent further thrombus formation

**Answer**:B. Pseudoporphyria

Explanation:

* A. Acquired epidermolysis bullosa (AEB) is a rare autoimmune skin condition characterized by fragile skin and mucous membranes that blister and tear easily. While AEB can present with bullae and erosions, the patient's history of allogeneic stem cell transplant and posttransplant infectious prophylaxis with valacyclovir hydrochloride, voriconazole, and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole suggests a higher likelihood of pseudoporphyria.
* C. Photoallergic drug reaction is a possibility, but the patient's history of outdoor activities and sun exposure prior to the onset of skin lesions suggests a more likely diagnosis of pseudoporphyria.
* D. Graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) is a complication that can occur after allogeneic stem cell transplantation. While GVHD can cause skin rashes and lesions, the patient's history of biopsy-proven grade 3 cutaneous and grade 2 gastrointestinal GVHD suggests that the skin lesions are more likely due to pseudoporphyria.

Pseudoporphyria is a rare photosensitive disorder characterized by a defect in the enzyme ferrochelatase, which is involved in the heme biosynthesis pathway. The condition is often triggered by sun exposure, which can cause bullae and erosions on sun-exposed areas. The patient's history of outdoor activities and sun exposure prior to the onset of skin lesions, along with the characteristic appearance of the bullae and erosions, supports the diagnosis of pseudoporphyria. A skin biopsy, such as the one performed on the patient, can help to confirm the diagnosis.

**Answer**: B. Erythrodermic sarcoidosis

The patient's history of atopic dermatitis and the presence of red-brown monomorphic papules coalescing into plaques on the face, trunk, and extremities, as well as the absence of associated fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss, joint pain, cough, difficulty breathing, or chest pain, are consistent with the diagnosis of erythrodermic sarcoidosis. Erythrodermic sarcoidosis is a rare variant of cutaneous sarcoidosis that is characterized by widespread erythematous papules and plaques on the skin, often with a symmetric distribution. The patient's age and race also increase the likelihood of this diagnosis, as erythrodermic sarcoidosis is more common in older adults and in African Americans.

The histopathologic findings of the skin biopsy, which showed a granulomatous inflammation with numerous macrophages, multinucleated giant cells, and a few lymphocytes, are also consistent with the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. The presence of periodic acid-Schiff positive and acid-fast bacilli negative staining results supports this diagnosis, as sarcoidosis is characterized by the presence of granulomas that stain positive for periodic acid-Schiff and negative for acid-fast bacilli.

Disseminated granuloma annulare (choice A) is a rare condition characterized by the development of multiple granulomas in the skin and other organs. While it can present with a similar appearance to erythrodermic sarcoidosis, the distribution of the lesions is typically more widespread and can involve the face, scalp, and extremities. In addition, the histopathologic findings of disseminated granuloma annulare are distinct from those of sarcoidosis, showing a mixture of epithelioid cells, multinucleated giant cells, and lymphocytes.

Mycosis fungoides (choice C) is a rare cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that can present with erythematous papules and plaques on the skin. However, the patient

**Answer**: A. Botryomycosis

Botryomycosis is a rare, chronic bacterial infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus, which can affect various parts of the body, including the skin and subcutaneous tissues. The patient's symptoms, such as the slow-growing, painful, and tender nodule on the left foot, are consistent with botryomycosis. The fact that the patient has a history of HIV infection and hepatitis B, which can compromise the immune system, increases the likelihood of this diagnosis.

The patient's report of clear-to-yellow material draining from the lesion, without any purulent drainage, is also consistent with botryomycosis, as the infection typically causes the formation of small abscesses or sinuses that drain a thick, yellowish material. Additionally, the absence of fever, chills, or other systemic symptoms supports this diagnosis, as botryomycosis typically presents as a localized infection.

The biopsy results, which showed acute and chronic inflammation within the deep dermis, with eosinophilic material surrounding small cocci, are also consistent with botryomycosis. The Gram staining of the biopsy supported the diagnosis, indicating the presence of bacteria.

In contrast, cutaneous tuberculosis, digital mucous cyst, and foreign-body reaction are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and biopsy results. Cutaneous tuberculosis typically presents with ulcerative or nodular lesions, and the patient's history of latent tuberculosis increases the likelihood of this diagnosis. However, the absence of any other skin lesions and the patient's recent completion of an 8-month course of isoniazid treatment make cutaneous tuberculosis less likely. Digital mucous cysts are typically small, soft, and painless, and do not have the same inflammatory changes as seen in botryomycosis. Foreign-body reactions are typically associated with a foreign body, and the patient's history and physical examination do not suggest the presence of a foreign body.

Answer: E. Congenital myasthenia gravis

Let's go through each option and explain why it's incorrect or correct:

A. Pompe disease: This is a genetic disorder that causes muscle weakness and wasting, but it's not associated with asthma or myasthenia gravis. The patient's symptoms of muscular weakness and hyperlordosis are not typical of Pompe disease.

B. Spinal muscular atrophy: This is a genetic disorder that affects the nerve cells responsible for controlling voluntary muscle movement, leading to muscle weakness and wasting. However, it's not associated with myasthenia gravis or asthma. The patient's symptoms of waddling gait and hyperlordosis are not typical of spinal muscular atrophy.

C. Seronegative myasthenia gravis: This is a form of myasthenia gravis where the patient doesn't have antibodies against acetylcholine receptors. However, the patient's symptoms of muscular weakness and hyperlordosis are not typical of seronegative myasthenia gravis. The patient's history of asthma and response to salbutamol treatment also don't fit with this diagnosis.

D. Becker muscular dystrophy: This is a genetic disorder that affects muscle strength and function, leading to progressive muscle weakness and wasting. However, it's not associated with myasthenia gravis or asthma. The patient's symptoms of waddling gait and hyperlordosis are not typical of Becker muscular dystrophy.

E. Congenital myasthenia gravis: This is a rare form of myasthenia gravis that is present at birth. It's characterized by muscle weakness and fatigue, which can be exacerbated by physical activity.

The correct answer is C: Hypothyroidism.

Hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormones, which are essential for growth and development. The patient's symptoms of bilateral hip pain and limp, as well as her short stature and delayed pubertal development, are consistent with hypothyroidism. Additionally, the patient's family history of hypothyroidism in her grandmother and father's history of coronary artery disease, which is a common comorbidity with hypothyroidism, support this diagnosis.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A: Hyponatremia is a condition in which the concentration of sodium in the blood is abnormally low. While hyponatremia can cause muscle weakness and fatigue, it is not typically associated with hip pain or limp. Moreover, the patient's blood work did not reveal any electrolyte imbalances.

B: Diabetes mellitus is a condition characterized by high blood sugar levels. While diabetes can cause muscle weakness and fatigue, it is not typically associated with hip pain or limp. Additionally, the patient's blood work did not reveal any abnormalities in glucose metabolism.

D: Fatty liver disease is a condition in which there is an abnormal accumulation of fat in the liver. While fatty liver disease can cause abdominal pain and discomfort, it is not typically associated with hip pain or limp. Moreover, the patient's physical examination did not reveal any signs of liver disease, such as jaundice or ascites.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, the most likely diagnosis is hypothyroidism.

**Answer**:C. Coronary angiography

Explanation:
The patient presented with chest pain and was found to have a small troponin leak, which is consistent with myocardial injury. The patient's history of multiple sclerosis and the absence of traditional atherosclerosis risk factors suggest that the myocardial injury may be due to a non-atherosclerotic mechanism. The patient's recent emotional stress and the presence of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy on echocardiography support this diagnosis.

Coronary angiography is the appropriate next step in management as it can help to identify any obstructive coronary artery disease that may have contributed to the myocardial injury. This is particularly important in patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, as they are at higher risk for coronary artery disease.

Echocardiography in 2 weeks to confirm Takotsubo cardiomyopathy (choice A) may not provide any additional information that would change management at this time. While it may be useful in confirming the diagnosis, it is not necessary at this time given the patient's clinical presentation and the results of the initial echocardiogram.

Magnetic resonance imaging to rule out myocarditis vs ischemia (choice B) may be useful in evaluating for myocarditis, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management. The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory results do not suggest myocarditis, and the presence of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy on echocardiography makes it less likely.

Computed tomographic coronary angiography (choice D) is not the most appropriate next step in management as it does not provide the same level of diagnostic accuracy as coronary angiography. While it may be useful in evaluating for coronary artery disease, it is not as sensitive or specific as coronary angiography, particularly in patients with non-atherosclerotic coronary artery disease.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain why C. Lymphangiomatous polyp is the correct answer and why the other choices are incorrect.

**Answer**: C. Lymphangiomatous polyp

A. Fibroepithelial polyp:
A fibroepithelial polyp is a type of benign growth that arises from the conjunction of the epithelial and connective tissue layers. While it is possible for a fibroepithelial polyp to occur in the tonsil, the patient's history of recurrent tonsillitis and the presence of a lobular mass extending from the inferior pole of the right tonsil suggest a different diagnosis. Additionally, the histologic findings of a polypoid structure composed of a fibrovascular core covered by stratified squamous epithelium and the presence of a subepithelial band of lymphoid tissue do not support this diagnosis.

B. Lymphangioma:
Lymphangioma is a rare benign tumor that arises from the lymphatic vessels. While it can occur in various locations, including the head and neck, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest this diagnosis. The patient did not report any symptoms consistent with lymphangioma, such as painless swelling or difficulty swallowing, and the physical examination findings did not reveal any signs of lymphatic obstruction or compression.

D. Juvenile angiofibroma:
Juvenile angiofibroma is a rare benign tumor that arises from the nasal cavity or paranasal sinuses. It typically affects children and young adults and is characterized by a slow-growing, painless mass in the nasal cavity or sinuses.

Answer: D. Solitary cutaneous myxoma

Explanation:

A. Epidermoid cyst: An epidermoid cyst is a type of benign growth that arises from the epidermis and is filled with keratin, a protein found in skin cells. While it is possible for an epidermoid cyst to occur on the auricle, the patient's history of a slow-growing mass and the absence of any skin abnormalities on the rest of his body make it less likely. Additionally, the histopathological examination revealed a hypocellular tumor with bland spindle cells, which is not consistent with the characteristic keratin-filled cysts of an epidermoid cyst.

B. Dermoid cyst: A dermoid cyst is a type of benign growth that arises from the skin and contains skin cells, hair follicles, and sweat glands. Like an epidermoid cyst, a dermoid cyst can occur on the auricle, but the patient's history and histopathological examination do not support this diagnosis. The absence of any skin abnormalities on the rest of the patient's body and the hypocellular nature of the tumor are not consistent with a dermoid cyst.

C. Chondroma: A chondroma is a benign cartilaginous tumor that can occur in various parts of the body, including the auricle. However, the patient's history of a slow-growing mass and the absence of any abnormalities on the rest of his body make it less likely. Additionally, the histopathological examination did not reveal any characteristic chondroid features, such as cartilage production or increased cellularity.

D. Solitary cutaneous myxoma: A solitary cutaneous myxoma is a rare, benign tumor that arises from the mesenchymal cells of the skin. It is characterized by a slow-growing, painless mass, which is consistent with the patient's history.

The correct answer is D. Osteitis fibrosa cystica.

Osteitis fibrosa cystica (OFC) is a rare benign bone disorder characterized by the formation of multiple cystic lesions in the bones, often associated with elevated levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and hypercalcemia. The patient's symptoms, such as a well-developed man in his 20s, high functional, denied abdominal pain, dysuria, anxiety, lethargy, and constipation, and physical examination findings within normal limits, are consistent with OFC. The elevated PTH level and the lesion in the location of the right inferior parathyroid gland, measured at 2.2 cm, shown on the technetium Tc 99m sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomographic/computed tomographic (SPECT/CT) scan, are also consistent with OFC.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Parathyroid carcinoma: Parathyroid carcinoma is a malignant tumor that arises from the parathyroid gland. While it can cause hypercalcemia and elevated PTH levels, it is not typically associated with multiple cystic lesions in the bones.

B. Multiple myeloma: Multiple myeloma is a malignancy of plasma cells that can cause hypercalcemia and elevated PTH levels. However, it is not typically associated with cystic lesions in the bones.

C. Primary bone tumor: A primary bone tumor is a malignant tumor that arises in the bone. While it can cause hypercalcemia and elevated PTH levels, it is not typically associated with multiple cystic lesions in the bones.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Osteitis fibrosa cystica.

A. Sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect various organs, including the lungs and larynx. However, it is unlikely to cause the symptoms described in the case, such as a husky voice, intermittent stertor, and dysphonia, without any respiratory symptoms or signs of systemic disease.

B. Respiratory papillomatosis is a condition characterized by the growth of papillomas in the respiratory tract, usually caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. However, the case does not mention any history of HPV infection, and the symptoms and test results do not support this diagnosis.

D. Metastatic neuroblastoma is a type of cancer that originates in the nerve tissue and can spread to other parts of the body. However, the case does not mention any history of cancer, and the symptoms and test results do not support this diagnosis.

C. Multifocal granular cell tumor is a rare benign tumor that can occur in various parts of the body, including the larynx. The symptoms described in the case, such as a husky voice, intermittent stertor, and dysphonia, are consistent with this diagnosis. The test results, including the otolaryngologic examination and the histopathologic examination of the excised masses, also support this diagnosis. The presence of a midline, firm, posterior cricoid mass and a midline, firm, anterior subglottic mass extending into the anterior commissure, as well as the negative staining for epithelial, muscle, endothelial, and glial cell immunohistologic markers, are all consistent with a diagnosis of multifocal granular cell tumor.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is C. Esophageal bronchus.

An esophageal bronchus is a rare congenital anomaly that occurs when there is a communication between the esophagus and the bronchus. In this case, the patient's symptoms of choking and desaturation with oral feeding, along with the videofluoroscopic swallow study demonstrating aspiration with all consistencies, suggest that the patient has an esophageal bronchus. The patient's history of polyhydramnios and gestational diabetes during pregnancy may also be relevant to the patient's overall health and potential management plan, but they are not directly related to the likely diagnosis of an esophageal bronchus.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Pulmonary sequestration: This is a rare congenital anomaly where a portion of lung tissue is separated from the rest of the lung and receives its blood supply from the systemic circulation rather than the pulmonary circulation. While pulmonary sequestration can present with similar symptoms to an esophageal bronchus, such as respiratory distress and coughing, it is not associated with aspiration or feeding difficulties.

B. Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM): This is a rare congenital lung disease characterized by cystic lesions in the lung. CCAM can present with respiratory symptoms, but it is not associated with aspiration or feeding difficulties.

D. Tracheoesophageal fistula: This is a rare congenital anomaly where there is a communication between the trachea and esophagus. While tracheoesophageal fistula can present with respiratory symptoms and feeding difficulties, it is not associated with aspiration.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and the results of the videofluoroscopic swallow study, the most likely diagnosis is an esophageal bronchus.

The correct answer is D. Repeat biopsy of orbital apex and sinuses.

Let's go through each answer choice and explain why it's incorrect or correct:

A. Repeat IV methyprednisolone with slower taper: This choice is incorrect because the patient's symptoms have not fully resolved with the initial course of steroids, and there is no indication of a steroid-responsive condition. Repeating the same treatment without modification may not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

B. Initiate steroid-sparing immunomodulator: This choice is incorrect because there is no indication of an immune-mediated condition, and the patient's symptoms have not fully responded to steroids. Adding another medication without further evaluation may not address the root cause of the patient's symptoms.

C. Initiate broad-spectrum IV antibacterials: This choice is incorrect because there is no evidence of an active bacterial infection. The patient's previous sinus and orbital apex biopsy did not reveal any microorganisms, and the patient's symptoms do not suggest an acute bacterial infection.

D. Repeat biopsy of orbital apex and sinuses: This choice is correct because the patient's symptoms have not fully resolved with previous treatment, and there is still a possibility of an underlying inflammatory or infectious condition that needs to be ruled out. Repeating the biopsy can help to identify any missed or new pathology that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms.

In summary, repeating the biopsy is the most appropriate next step in the patient's management, as it can help to identify the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and guide further treatment.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is B: Take the patient to the operating room for a saline washout with an air bubble.

The reason for this is that a saline washout with an air bubble is a common technique used to treat hemorrhagic Descemet membrane detachment. The saline solution helps to clear out any blood or debris that may be obstructing the view of the surgeon, while the air bubble helps to separate the detached membrane from the underlying tissue, allowing for better visualization and removal of the blood.

In contrast, choice A, Continue to observe, is not a suitable option as it does not address the issue of the hemorrhagic Descemet membrane detachment and may allow the condition to worsen, potentially leading to further vision loss.

Choice C, Take the patient to the operating room for an alteplase washout with an air bubble, is also not a suitable option as alteplase is a thrombolytic agent that is used to break down blood clots, but it may not be effective in this case as the hemorrhage is not due to a clot.

Choice D, Laser Descemet membrane membranotomy, is not a suitable option as it is a surgical procedure that is used to create a hole in the Descemet membrane to relieve pressure and promote drainage in cases of glaucoma, but it is not appropriate for the treatment of hemorrhagic Descemet membrane detachment.

Therefore, the best option is B: Take the patient to the operating room for a saline washout with an air bubble.

**Answer**: C. Instill atropine and IOP-lowering drops and place the patient in a supine position

The patient in this case is presenting with acute eye pain, blurry vision, and photophobia in her right eye, which began after she had been napping face-down on her desk for 30 minutes. The patient has a history of dislocated lenses and is experiencing conjunctival injection, corneal stromal edema with Descemet folds and lenticulocorneal touch, a shallowed anterior chamber, and a lens protruding through the pupil with the superior edge in the anterior chamber.

Given these symptoms and findings, the most appropriate next step would be to instill atropine and IOP-lowering drops and place the patient in a supine position. This is because the patient is experiencing acute angle closure glaucoma, which is caused by the sudden blockage of the trabecular meshwork by the dislocated lens. The atropine will help to dilate the pupil and reduce the pressure in the eye, while the IOP-lowering drops will help to further reduce the intraocular pressure. Placing the patient in a supine position will also help to reduce the pressure in the eye by allowing gravity to help drain the aqueous humor.

**Answer**: A. Perform laser iridotomy

Performing laser iridotomy would not be the most appropriate next step in this case. While laser iridotomy is a common treatment for acute angle closure glaucoma, it is not the most urgent intervention needed in this case. The patient's symptoms and findings suggest that the angle closure is caused by the dislocated lens, and laser iridotomy would not address the underlying cause of the problem.

**Answer**: D. Fluorescein angiography

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as diffuse retinal hemorrhages, peripapillary hemorrhages, and disc edema, suggest a possible diagnosis of hypoxia-induced retinal damage. Fluorescein angiography is the best diagnostic test to evaluate the retinal circulation and identify any areas of non-perfusion or leakage that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms.

Choice A, complete blood cell count and coagulation testing, may be useful in evaluating the patient's overall health and identifying any potential bleeding disorders, but it is not the most appropriate test for evaluating the retinal circulation.

Choice B, oral and topical corticosteroids, may be used to treat inflammation and edema in the eye, but it is not the most appropriate treatment for hypoxia-induced retinal damage.

Choice C, plasmapheresis for hyperviscosity syndrome, is not a relevant treatment option for this patient's condition. Hyperviscosity syndrome is a complication of multiple myeloma and is not associated with retinal hemorrhages.

Therefore, the correct answer is D, Fluorescein angiography.

**Answer**:A. Small-bowel adenocarcinoma

The correct answer is A, Small-bowel adenocarcinoma, because it is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and the findings on computed tomography (CT) scan.

The patient presented with sudden onset of cramps and abdominal pain, which could be consistent with a small-bowel obstruction. The CT scan showed a small-bowel obstruction with a transition zone located at the mid-jejunum, and an intraluminal hypodense mass was demonstrated in this area, which appeared to be the cause of the obstruction. Adjacent to this area, the capsule was clearly demonstrated in a dilated proximal loop of the small bowel. These findings are consistent with a small-bowel adenocarcinoma causing the obstruction.

Choice B, Lymphoma of the small bowel, is unlikely because the patient did not present with any symptoms suggestive of lymphoma, such as weight loss, fever, or night sweats. Additionally, the CT scan did not show any evidence of lymphadenopathy or extraluminal disease.

Choice C, Carcinoid tumor, is also unlikely because the patient's symptoms and CT scan findings are not consistent with a carcinoid tumor. Carcinoid tumors typically cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, and flushing, and the CT scan would likely show a well-circumscribed mass with a characteristic "salt and pepper" appearance.

Choice D, Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) of the small bowel, is unlikely because the patient's symptoms and CT scan findings are not consistent with a GIST. GISTs typically cause abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, and the CT scan would likely show a well-circumscribed mass with a characteristic "spotted" appearance.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and CT scan findings, the most likely diagnosis is small-bowel adenocarcinoma.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain why C. Cecal diverticulitis is the correct answer and why the other choices are incorrect.

**Answer**: C. Cecal diverticulitis

Cecal diverticulitis is the correct answer because it aligns with the patient's symptoms and the findings on ultrasonography. The patient's symptoms of right lower quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting are consistent with cecal diverticulitis. The ultrasonography findings of thickening of the cecal wall and a hypoechoic area with blurred margins also support this diagnosis. Cecal diverticulitis occurs when a diverticulum in the cecum becomes inflamed, leading to symptoms and signs of abdominal pain, fever, and leukocytosis.

Now, let's discuss why the other choices are incorrect:

A. Cecal carcinoma: While cecal carcinoma can present with similar symptoms, the ultrasonography findings do not support this diagnosis. Cecal carcinoma typically appears as a mass with irregular margins, and there is usually no evidence of inflammation or thickening of the cecal wall.

B. Retrocecal acute appendicitis: Retrocecal acute appendicitis can also present with right lower quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. However, the ultrasonography findings do not support this diagnosis. In appendicitis, the appendix is typically enlarged, and there may be evidence of inflammation or fluid in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen.

D. Terminal ileitis: Terminal ileitis can present with symptoms similar to cecal diverticulitis, but the ultrasonography findings do not support this diagnosis. Terminal ileitis typically appears as a thickening of the terminal ileum, and there may be evidence of inflammation or fluid in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen.

In summary, C. Cecal diverticulitis is the correct answer because it aligns with the patient's symptoms and the findings on ultrasonography. The other choices do not support the diagnosis based on the patient's

**Answer**:A. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, such as a rapidly expanding scalp mass, progressive generalized weakness, slowed speech, and focal right-handed weakness, are consistent with a diagnosis of Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). The patient's age, an 80-year-old woman, also aligns with the demographic typically affected by NHL.

The imaging results also support this diagnosis. The large extracranial and intracranial mass extending into the superior sagittal sinus, brain, soft tissue, and bone, with left dural thickening, is consistent with NHL. Additionally, the involvement of the superior sagittal sinus and progressive growth suggests a high-grade lymphoma, which is more commonly seen in NHL than in other types of lymphoma.

The other options do not align with the patient's symptoms and imaging results:

B. Meningioma: This type of tumor is typically slow-growing and does not usually cause rapid neurological deterioration as seen in this patient. Meningioma is also more common in older adults, but the patient's symptoms and imaging results do not support this diagnosis.

C. Glioblastoma multiforme: This type of tumor is typically seen in older adults and can cause rapid neurological deterioration. However, the imaging results do not support this diagnosis, as the mass extends into the superior sagittal sinus and there is no evidence of vasogenic edema or associated mass effect.

D. Meningeal sarcoma: This type of tumor is rare and typically affects younger adults. It can cause rapid neurological deterioration, but the imaging results do not support this diagnosis, as there is no evidence of bone involvement or dural thickening.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and imaging results, the most likely diagnosis is Non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

**Answer**: B. Initiate antiviral therapy with valacyclovir

The correct answer is B because the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of herpes zoster, also known as shingles. Herpes zoster is a viral infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus, which is highly susceptible to valacyclovir, an antiviral medication. Initiating antiviral therapy with valacyclovir would be appropriate to treat the patient's condition and reduce the risk of complications such as postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a common complication of herpes zoster that can cause persistent pain in the affected area.

Now, let's discuss why the other answer choices are incorrect:

A. Obtain blood cultures: While it's important to consider other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a bacterial infection, the patient's history and physical examination findings suggest a viral etiology. Therefore, obtaining blood cultures would not be the most appropriate next step.

C. Prescribe an oral antihistamine agent: Antihistamines are used to treat allergic reactions and would not be effective in treating a viral infection such as herpes zoster.

D. Prescribe a topical corticosteroid cream: Topical corticosteroids are used to reduce inflammation and itching associated with skin conditions. However, they would not be effective in treating the underlying viral infection.

I hope this explanation helps clarify the reasoning behind the correct answer.

**Answer**:A. Avoid further ibuprofen use and prescribe a topical steroid

The correct answer is A because the patient's symptoms of fever and pustular rash are consistent with a diagnosis of acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP), which is a known adverse reaction to ibuprofen. The patient's recent use of ibuprofen and the absence of any other likely causes of AGEP suggest that the medication is the likely culprit. Therefore, avoiding further use of ibuprofen is appropriate.

Topical steroids can help reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms of AGEP. Oral antihistamines or systemic corticosteroids may also be considered, but topical steroids are a reasonable first-line treatment.

Infliximab therapy (choice B) is not indicated for AGEP, as it is a medication used to treat autoimmune diseases such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and rheumatoid arthritis.

Oral cephalexin therapy (choice C) is not appropriate for AGEP, as it is an antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections, and there is no indication of a bacterial infection in this case.

Obtaining a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) immunoassay (choice D) is not relevant to the patient's symptoms or diagnosis, and therefore, it is not an appropriate next step in management.

**Answer**: D
Explanation:

A: Begin antiretroviral therapy (ART):
ART is not the next step in management, as the patient's HIV status is already under control, with a high CD4 cell count. ART may be considered later as a long-term management option to prevent opportunistic infections, but it is not the most appropriate choice for the patient's current condition.

B: Obtain a brain biopsy:
A brain biopsy may be considered to establish a definitive diagnosis, but it is not the most urgent step in management. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results already suggest a likely diagnosis of PCNSL, and starting treatment promptly is critical to prevent further damage. A biopsy may be performed later, if necessary, to confirm the diagnosis.

C: Perform a lumbar puncture for examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF):
A lumbar puncture is not necessary at this point, as the patient's symptoms and laboratory results already suggest a diagnosis of PCNSL. Additionally, the patient's neurological symptoms, such as hyperreflexia, bilateral shoulder weakness, and right-sided pronator drift, are not typical of CNS toxoplasmosis.

D: Start treatment for central nervous system (CNS) toxoplasmosis:
This is the most appropriate next step in management, as the patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of PCNSL, which is a type of CNS toxoplasmosis. The patient's history of smoking marijuana and multiple male sexual partners suggests a possible exposure to Toxoplasma gondii. Starting treatment promptly is critical to prevent further damage and improve the patient's chances of recovery.

**Answer**:B. Methimazole-induced vasculitis

The correct answer is B, Methimazole-induced vasculitis, for the following reasons:

1. **Polyarteritis nodosa (A)**: Polyarteritis nodosa is a systemic vasculitis that affects medium-sized arteries. While it can cause cutaneous ulcers, the distribution of the lesions in this case, bilateral lower extremities, is not typical for polyarteritis nodosa. Additionally, the patient's history of Graves disease and the presence of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) cultures suggest a different underlying etiology.
2. **Ecthyma (C)**: Ecthyma is a bacterial infection of the skin that causes ulcers and crusting. While the patient's lesions do have some features of ecthyma, such as the presence of eschars and collarettes of scale, the distribution and severity of the lesions are not typical for ecthyma. Additionally, the patient's history of Graves disease and the presence of MSSA cultures suggest a different underlying etiology.
3. **Pyoderma gangrenosum (D)**: Pyoderma gangrenosum is a neutrophilic skin infection that can cause ulcers and crusting. While it can affect the lower extremities, the patient's history of Graves disease and the presence of MSSA cultures suggest a different underlying etiology. Additionally, the histopathological findings of a lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with neutrophils and focal abscess, as seen in the punch biopsy specimen, are not typical for pyoderma gangrenosum.
4. **Methimazole-induced vasculitis (B)**: Methimazole is a medication commonly used to treat hyperthyroidism, and it has been associated with a rare but potentially life-threatening side effect: vasculitis. The patient's history of Graves disease and the recent initiation of methimazole therapy suggest that methimazole-induced vasculitis may be the

**Answer**: B. Erythropoietic protoporphyria

The correct answer is B. Erythropoietic protoporphyria because it matches the patient's symptoms and medical history. Erythropoietic protoporphyria is a rare genetic disorder that affects the skin and leads to photosensitivity, which is consistent with the patient's reported photosensitivity during childhood. The patient's progressive pruritic eruption involving the nose and dorsal hands, as well as the skin-colored, waxy, smooth, and variably verrucous papules and plaques, are also consistent with the characteristic skin manifestations of erythropoietic protoporphyria.

The other answer choices do not match the patient's symptoms and medical history:

A. Nodular amyloidosis: This is a condition where abnormal proteins accumulate in the skin, leading to the formation of nodules. While it can cause skin lesions, it does not match the patient's reported photosensitivity or the characteristic skin manifestations of erythropoietic protoporphyria.

C. Colloid milium: This is a benign growth that appears as a small, yellowish bump on the skin. It is usually seen in children and does not have any connection to photosensitivity or the skin manifestations described in the patient's case.

D. Lipoid proteinosis: This is a rare genetic disorder that affects the skin and causes the accumulation of lipids in the skin, leading to the formation of papules and nodules. While it can cause skin lesions, it does not match the patient's reported photosensitivity or the characteristic skin manifestations of erythropoietic protoporphyria.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Erythropoietic protoporphyria.

**Answer**:A. Atypical hand-foot-mouth disease

The patient's symptoms, including the spreading painful blisters on the hands and feet, rhinorrhea, cough, low-grade fever, and the appearance of pink to violaceous macules, papules, and patches on the palms, dorsal hands, forearms, elbows, feet, and distal lower extremities, are consistent with atypical hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD). The presence of dusky bullae on the bilateral dorsal aspect of the hands, fingers, toes, and heels also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and recent use of cyclosporine, which can cause HFMD as a side effect, further support this diagnosis.

B. Disseminated zoster: This choice is incorrect because the patient's symptoms do not match the typical presentation of disseminated zoster, which typically presents with widespread vesicles and crusting on the trunk and limbs, as well as severe pain. While the patient does have some blisters and bullae, they are not widespread and are primarily located on the hands and feet.

C. Erythema multiforme: This choice is incorrect because the patient's symptoms do not match the typical presentation of erythema multiforme, which typically presents with target-like lesions on the trunk and limbs. While the patient does have some macules, papules, and patches on the skin, they are not target-like and are primarily located on the hands and feet.

D. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis: This choice is incorrect because the patient's symptoms do not match the typical presentation of leukocytoclastic vasculitis, which typically presents with palpable purpura and ulcerations on the skin. While the patient does have some violaceous macules and papules on the skin, they are not typical of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Additionally, the patient's laboratory results, including a normal white blood cell count and platelet count, do not support this diagnosis.

**Answer**: D. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease

The patient's symptoms of progressive cerebellar ataxia, difficulty with speech and hearing, and eventual progression to mutism and loss of motor function are consistent with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). CJD is a rare, degenerative brain disorder caused by an abnormal form of a protein called a prion. It is characterized by rapid neurological deterioration, including ataxia, myoclonus, and cognitive decline, leading to death within months or years.

The patient's lack of a family history of imbalance problems and the absence of oligoclonal bands and abnormal protein 14-3-3 in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) make CJD more likely than other diagnoses. Additionally, the patient's normal electroencephalogram (EEG) and absence of myoclonus or parkinsonism also support the diagnosis of CJD.

While adult-onset cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss syndrome (choice B) may present with similar symptoms, the patient's age of onset, rapid progression, and lack of other neurological signs do not support this diagnosis.

Paraneoplastic cerebellar ataxia (choice A) is a rare condition that can be associated with certain types of cancer, such as breast, lung, or ovarian cancer. However, the patient's lack of a history of cancer and the absence of other neurological signs, such as myoclonus or parkinsonism, make this diagnosis less likely.

Wernicke encephalopathy (choice C) is a condition caused by a deficiency in thiamine (vitamin B1) and can present with ataxia, confusion, and ophthalmoplegia. However, the patient's lack of a history of alcoholism or malnutrition and the absence of other neurological signs, such as myoclonus or parkinsonism, make Wernicke encephalopathy less likely.

**Answer**:D. Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids (HDLS)

The patient's symptoms of progressive depression, bradyphrenia, dyscalculia, and fatigue, as well as the physical examination findings of abulic behavior, Mini-Mental State Examination score of 24 of 30, and scattered small foci of T2 hyperintensity in the white matter, are consistent with a diagnosis of Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids (HDLS). HDLS is a rare genetic disorder characterized by progressive cerebral and cerebellar atrophy, with a variety of cognitive and motor symptoms.

The patient's family history, with a mother who died at 32 years of age after having a chronic neuropsychiatric illness, culminating in a rapidly progressive dementia, suggests a strong possibility of an inherited disorder. The presence of multitudinous corpora amylacea in the mother's brain, as revealed by a postmortem brain examination, supports this diagnosis.

The other answer choices do not fit the patient's symptoms and examination findings as well as HDLS.

A. Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the brain's blood vessels, leading to recurrent stroke-like episodes, cognitive decline, and various other symptoms. While it may present with similar symptoms, the presence of scattered small foci of T2 hyperintensity in the white matter and the absence of abnormal enhancement on MRI do not support this diagnosis.

B. Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) is a genetic disorder that affects the breakdown of fatty acids and leads to the accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids in the brain and adrenal gland.

**Answer**:B. Pediculosis corporis

The patient's symptoms, such as a diffuse truncal rash and numerous ill-defined 0.5- to 1-cm nonblanching blue-gray macules on his trunk, are consistent with pediculosis corporis, also known as body lice infestation. The presence of several similar pink 2-mm papules and hemorrhagic punctae scattered on his trunk, extremities, and scalp further support this diagnosis. The fact that the patient's cousin had a diagnosis of chicken pox 6 months prior and had persistent skin lesions and pruritus, and the patient's mother had several pruritic pink papules on her bilateral forearms, suggests a possible household infestation.

Option A, drug rash, is unlikely as the patient had no history of new medication use and the rash was not consistent with a typical drug rash.

Option C, leukemia cutis, is unlikely as the patient did not have any signs of systemic disease, such as fever, night sweats, or weight loss, and the skin lesions were not consistent with the typical appearance of leukemia cutis.

**Answer**:B. Obtain cardiac magnetic resonance imaging

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of exercise-induced syncope, along with the findings of first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, borderline right axis deviation, and right bundle branch block on the resting electrocardiogram (ECG), suggest a possible conduction system abnormality. The abrupt decrease in heart rate during peak exercise, with evidence of AV block, further supports this diagnosis.

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation. MRI can provide detailed information on the structure and function of the heart, including the conduction system. It can help identify any abnormalities in the conduction system, such as a prolonged PR interval or bundle branch block, and can also assess for other potential causes of syncope, such as cardiac arrhythmias or structural abnormalities.

In contrast, tilt table testing (choice A) may be useful in evaluating patients with syncope, but it is not the most appropriate test in this case, as the patient's symptoms are specifically related to exercise and the findings on the resting ECG suggest a conduction system abnormality.

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is also a more appropriate test than placing a dual chamber pacemaker (choice C) at this stage of the patient's evaluation. While a pacemaker may ultimately be necessary, it is important to first confirm the diagnosis and understand the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms before proceeding with device therapy.

Finally, implanting a loop recorder (choice D) may be considered in some cases of syncope, but it is not the most appropriate test in this case, as the patient's symptoms are specifically related to exercise and the findings on the resting ECG suggest a conduction system abnormality. A loop recorder may be more useful in cases where the symptoms are less specific or occur more frequently.

**Answer**:B. McCune-Albright syndrome

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and findings are consistent with McCune-Albright syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of various tissues, including bones, skin, and endocrine system. The characteristic features of this syndrome include bony lesions, skin macules, and endocrinopathies.

The patient's bony changes, including the heterogeneous opacification of the right ethmoid and maxillary sinuses, fluid accumulation within the bilateral mastoid bones and middle ears, and the varus deformity of the lower extremities, are consistent with the bony lesions seen in McCune-Albright syndrome. The skin macules with irregular borders on the lower back, upper buttock, upper chest, upper neck, and right postauricular area are also a common feature of this syndrome. Additionally, the patient's endocrinopathies, including the hypothyroidism, are consistent with the endocrine dysfunction that can occur in McCune-Albright syndrome.

In contrast, Langerhans cell histiocytosis (choice A) is a disorder that affects the immune system and can cause bone lesions, but it typically does not involve the skin or endocrine system. Juvenile Paget disease (choice C) is a disorder that affects bone metabolism and can cause bone deformities, but it does not typically involve the skin or endocrine system. Ossifying fibromas (choice D) are benign bone tumors that can cause bone deformities, but they do not typically involve the skin or endocrine system.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and findings, the most likely diagnosis is McCune-Albright syndrome, which is why choice B is the correct answer.

**Answer**: B. Laryngeal gout

The patient's symptoms and test results indicate that the most likely diagnosis is laryngeal gout. Gout is a type of inflammatory arthritis caused by the buildup of uric acid in the body. The patient's history of a 10-pack-year smoking history and Agent Orange exposure increases the likelihood of this diagnosis, as both are risk factors for gout. The patient's symptoms of a hoarse voice and bilateral true vocal fold lesions are consistent with laryngeal gout. The lesions are likely formed by the deposition of uric acid in the laryngeal tissues.

The patient's history of congestive heart failure and coronary artery disease increases the risk of surgical complications, which may have led to the decision to perform office potassium titanyl phosphate laser photoangiolysis of the lesions instead of surgery.

Amyloidosis is a condition where abnormal proteins accumulate in the body's tissues. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including vocal cord lesions, but it is not typically associated with a history of smoking or Agent Orange exposure. The negative Congo red stain result also makes amyloidosis less likely.

Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that can affect the larynx. It is less likely in this case because of the patient's history and the appearance of the lesions. The lesions are described as exophytic and yellow-white, which is not typical of squamous cell carcinoma.

Rheumatoid nodules are firm lumps that form in the tissues under the skin and are associated with rheumatoid arthritis. They are less likely in this case because the patient does not have a history of rheumatoid arthritis, and the lesions are not described as firm or nodular.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and test results, the most likely diagnosis is laryngeal gout, which is answer B.

**Answer**:B. Dermoid cyst

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, as well as the imaging results, are consistent with a diagnosis of a dermoid cyst. A dermoid cyst is a type of benign growth that occurs when skin cells and tissues become trapped in a cavity and continue to grow and develop, eventually forming a cyst. In this case, the cyst is located in the floor of the mouth, which is a relatively rare location for a dermoid cyst.

The patient's history of a gradually increasing swelling in the sublingual area over a period of 10 days, followed by a stable period over the past week, is consistent with the slow-growing nature of a dermoid cyst. The absence of any pain, fever, or difficulty breathing also supports this diagnosis, as dermoid cysts are usually asymptomatic unless they become infected or rupture.

The physical examination findings of significant, soft, nontender swelling of the floor of mouth bilaterally, causing elevation of the tongue, are consistent with a dermoid cyst. The absence of edema of the tongue or lips and the lack of palpable lymphadenopathy in the neck also support this diagnosis.

The imaging results, which showed a 6.3-cm anteroposterior × 6.9-cm cranial caudal × 4.8-cm transverse cystic nonenhancing mass centered in the root of the tongue, with elevation of the oral aspect of the tongue and some downward displacement of the floor of mouth, are also consistent with a dermoid cyst. The fact that the sublingual glands were compressed but otherwise appeared normal, and the sublingual spaces were effaced, further supports this diagnosis.

Surgical excision via an intraoral approach yielded a smooth, well-circumscribed mass, which is consistent with the characteristic appearance of a dermoid cyst. The histologic examination showing keratinizing squamous epithelium also supports this diagnosis, as dermoid cysts are known to have a squamous epithelial lining.

**Answer**:B. Observation with normal follow-up

The patient in this case is a young, asymptomatic man with a dark retinal lesion in his left eye that was discovered on routine ocular examination. The lesion has been present for at least 4 years, and the patient has had no previous ocular trauma and a non-contributory medical and surgical history. The patient's visual acuity is 20/20 in both eyes, and there is no evidence of retinal traction, macular edema, retinal exudation, or subretinal fluid.

Given these findings, the most appropriate next step would be to observe the patient with normal follow-up. The lesion has been stable for at least 4 years, and there is no evidence of any active disease process. The patient's visual acuity is normal, and there is no indication for surgical intervention.

Option A, genetic testing, may be appropriate for certain retinal conditions, but it is not indicated in this case. The patient's lesion is not typical of any known genetic retinal disorders, and there is no family history of such conditions.

Option C, surgical excision and histopathologic analysis, is not appropriate at this time. The lesion is not causing any symptoms, and there is no indication for surgical intervention. Additionally, surgical excision of a retinal lesion carries risks, including retinal detachment, cataract formation, and vision loss.

Option D, staging workup (e.g., total-body positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging), is also not appropriate at this time. There is no evidence of any systemic disease process, and the patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with a benign retinal lesion. Imaging studies such as PET/CT scans are typically reserved for patients with suspected systemic disease or those with more severe or atypical retinal findings.

In summary, the most appropriate next step for this patient would be to observe him with normal follow-up, monitoring for any changes in the lesion or the patient's visual acuity. If there are any changes or concerns, further evaluation and management can be tailored to the individual patient'

**Answer**:C. Serum and urine testing for various inflammatory and infectious processes

The correct answer is C. Serum and urine testing for various inflammatory and infectious processes. This is because the patient's symptoms, such as bilateral optic nerve head changes, elevated nasal disc borders, and mild hyperemia, suggest a possible inflammatory or infectious etiology. Additionally, the patient's recent use of oral antibiotics for a tooth infection increases the likelihood of an underlying infection.

Serum and urine testing can help identify various inflammatory and infectious conditions, such as autoimmune disorders, vasculitis, and infections like meningitis or encephalitis. These tests can provide valuable information to guide further management and treatment.

Observation with close follow-up (A) may be appropriate for some cases, but given the patient's symptoms and recent use of antibiotics, further testing is warranted to rule out any underlying conditions that may require prompt treatment.

Lumbar puncture (B) may be necessary in some cases, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's evaluation, as it is invasive and carries risks. Moreover, the patient's symptoms do not suggest a clear indication for lumbar puncture at this point.

Orbital and brain magnetic resonance imaging (D) may also be considered in the evaluation of patients with bilateral optic nerve head changes, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as it is expensive, time-consuming, and may not provide conclusive evidence of an inflammatory or infectious etiology. Instead, serum and urine testing can provide valuable information to guide further management and help determine if additional imaging is necessary.

**Answer**: C. Biopsy the eyelid

The patient's symptoms of recurrent central corneal erosions, subconjunctival hyperemia, and meibomian gland dysfunction, as well as the asymmetric erythema of the eyelid margin, suggest a possible diagnosis of ocular rosacea. The history of basal cell carcinoma and recent onset of ptosis also support this diagnosis.

A biopsy of the eyelid would be the appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis of ocular rosacea and rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms. Biopsy would also help to determine the extent of the disease and guide further management.

In contrast, initiating treatment with doxycycline (Option A) may be appropriate for rosacea, but it would not confirm the diagnosis. Increasing the frequency of tobramycin-dexamethasone ointment (Option B) may help manage blepharitis symptoms, but it would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Repairing the ptosis (Option D) may be necessary, but it would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Biopsy the eyelid.

**Answer**:B. Order bloodwork (complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, VDRL, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and antinuclear antibody) and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits

Explanation:

A. Perform a lumbar puncture with opening pressure measurement and cerebrospinal fluid analysis:
This choice is incorrect because while a lumbar puncture may be necessary to diagnose conditions such as meningitis or encephalitis, it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a possible inflammatory or demyelinating process affecting the optic nerve, and bloodwork and imaging studies are more appropriate to evaluate this condition.

C. Order molecular testing for Leber hereditary optic neuropathy:
This choice is incorrect because while Leber hereditary optic neuropathy is a possible cause of unilateral optic nerve edema, it is a rare condition. The patient's age and lack of family history make it less likely, and there are other more common conditions that need to be ruled out first. Additionally, molecular testing is not necessary at this point in the patient's evaluation.

D. Order computed tomography of the orbits:
This choice is incorrect because while computed tomography (CT) imaging may be useful in evaluating the orbits, it is not the most appropriate imaging modality to evaluate the optic nerve and surrounding tissues. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a more sensitive and specific imaging modality for evaluating the optic nerve and brain.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Order bloodwork (complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, VDRL, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and antinuclear antibody) and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits. This choice is appropriate because bloodwork can help identify systemic inflammatory or infectious conditions that may be affecting the optic nerve, while MRI can help evaluate the optic nerve and surrounding tissues for any

**Answer**:B. Foreign body ingestion

The patient's symptoms of gradual onset of severe right lower quadrant abdominal pain over 24 hours, leukocytosis, and tenderness in the right lower quadrant without overt signs of peritonitis, along with the presence of calcification in the terminal ileum with surrounding enteritis on the coronal CT scan, suggest a foreign body ingestion. The patient's history of an appendectomy when he was 10 years old increases the likelihood of a foreign body being present in the terminal ileum.

Stump appendicitis (choice A) is unlikely as the patient does not have a fever and is hemodynamically normal. Stump appendicitis typically presents with fever, tachycardia, and tenderness in the right lower quadrant.

Crohn's ileitis (choice C) is also unlikely as the patient does not have a history of inflammatory bowel disease and there is no evidence of chronic inflammation in the terminal ileum.

Carcinoid (choice D) is a rare possibility, but it is not supported by the patient's symptoms or laboratory results. Carcinoid tumors typically present with symptoms such as flushing, diarrhea, and wheezing, and are often associated with a carcinoid syndrome.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is foreign body ingestion, which can cause symptoms similar to appendicitis and can lead to complications such as intestinal perforation.

**Answer**: C. Inclusion cyst

The patient's symptoms of weight loss, heartburn, and dysphagia to solid food, along with the physical examination findings and laboratory workup, suggest a diagnosis of a gastrointestinal disorder. The esophagram and computed tomography (CT) scan reveal a 2.7-cm filling defect at the gastroesophageal junction, which is consistent with extrinsic compression. The endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) demonstrates an anechoic, loculated, subepithelial lesion located within the submucosa of the distal esophagus.

The correct answer, C. Inclusion cyst, is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and imaging findings. An inclusion cyst is a type of benign tumor that arises from the inclusion of embryonic remnants or aberrant glands in the esophageal wall. The patient's symptoms of dysphagia and heartburn are consistent with an inclusion cyst, as it can cause compression of the esophagus and disrupt normal esophageal function. The imaging findings, including the CT scan and EUS, support this diagnosis by showing a well-defined, non-invasive lesion in the submucosa of the distal esophagus.

The other answer choices are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and imaging findings:

A. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST): GISTs are rare tumors that can occur in the digestive tract, including the esophagus. However, the patient's symptoms and imaging findings do not support this diagnosis. GISTs typically cause abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, and the imaging findings typically show a larger, more irregular mass than what is described in this case.

B. Esophageal carcinoma: Esophageal carcinoma is a malignant tumor that can occur in the esophagus. However, the patient's symptoms and imaging findings do not support this diagnosis. Esophageal carcinoma typically causes difficulty swallowing, weight loss

The correct answer is D. Lymphoma.

Lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the immune system, specifically the lymphatic system. It can arise in various parts of the body, including the head and neck. The patient's symptoms of progressive supraclavicular, facial, and mandibular swelling, as well as the physical examination findings of a firm, adherent, immobile mass in the left preauricular space and a fixed mass in the left parotid gland, are consistent with lymphoma. The patient's history of sarcoidosis also increases the likelihood of a lymphoproliferative disorder such as lymphoma.

The imaging findings also support the diagnosis of lymphoma. The lobulated paramandibular mass extending into the left masticator space and infratemporal fossa, with frank erosion of the left mandibular condyle, is consistent with a lymphoma. The presence of enlarged lymph nodes in the neck and chest, as well as the metabolically active masses in the left masticator space and right supraclavicular region, are also consistent with lymphoma.

The other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.

A. Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that can arise in the head and neck, but it typically presents with a ulcerative or exophytic mass, rather than a fixed, adherent mass.

B. Chondrosarcoma is a type of bone cancer that can arise in the mandible, but it typically presents with pain and swelling in the jaw, rather than the supraclavicular and facial swelling seen in this patient.

C. Adenoid cystic carcinoma is a type of salivary gland cancer that can arise in the parotid gland, but it typically presents with a painless mass in the parotid gland, rather than the fixed, adherent mass seen in this patient.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Lymphoma.

**Answer**: A. Perform a biopsy of skin lesion

The correct answer is A, Perform a biopsy of skin lesion, because it is the most appropriate next step in the evaluation of this patient's symptoms. The patient has a history of tingling and pain in his hands and feet, as well as near-complete loss of eyebrows and eyelashes, scaly plaque on the right shin, and mild bilateral erythema of the earlobes, distal fingers, and toes. These symptoms suggest a possible diagnosis of leprosy, which is a chronic bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium leprae. Leprosy can cause a range of skin and nerve damage, including skin lesions, nerve damage, and loss of sensation in the affected areas.

Performing a biopsy of the skin lesion would allow for a definitive diagnosis of leprosy, as well as provide information about the severity and extent of the infection. This information is crucial in determining the appropriate treatment and management of the patient's condition.

The other answer choices are not as appropriate for the following reasons:

B. Check rapid plasma reagin, thyroid-stimulating hormone level, and lead level: While these tests may be useful in evaluating other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, they are not specific to leprosy and would not provide a definitive diagnosis.

C. Empirically treat with a topical steroid: Topical steroids may be used to treat skin symptoms associated with leprosy, but they are not a substitute for a definitive diagnosis and appropriate treatment.

D. Empirically treat patient and close contacts with dapsone: Dapsone is a medication used to treat leprosy, but it is not appropriate to treat the patient and close contacts empirically without a definitive diagnosis. Additionally, treating close contacts without a diagnosis could be unnecessary and potentially harmful.

Therefore, the best next step in the evaluation of this patient would be to perform a biopsy of the skin lesion to confirm the diagnosis of leprosy and guide further management.

**Answer**:D. Equestrian perniosis

The correct answer is D. Equestrian perniosis because it matches the given symptoms and patient history. Equestrian perniosis, also known as chronic cold panniculitis, is a condition that affects the thighs and buttocks of horse riders who spend extended periods in the saddle. The condition is caused by prolonged pressure and cold exposure, leading to inflammation and fat necrosis in the subcutaneous tissue.

The patient's symptoms, such as painful erythematous eruption over the bilateral thighs, worsening during winter months, and focal areas of ulceration with overlying scale-crust, are consistent with equestrian perniosis. The patient's history of working at a horse stable and riding for many hours a day also supports this diagnosis.

The other answer choices do not match the patient's symptoms and history:

A. Erythema annulare centrifugum is a condition characterized by the development of small, ring-shaped lesions on the skin. While it may have a similar appearance to equestrian perniosis, it is not associated with cold exposure or prolonged pressure.

B. Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus is a form of lupus that affects the skin and may cause lesions on sun-exposed areas. However, it is not associated with cold exposure or prolonged pressure, and the patient does not report any other symptoms consistent with lupus.

C. Palisaded neutrophilic and granulomatous dermatitis is a condition characterized by the formation of neutrophilic and granulomatous inflammation in the skin. While it may have a similar appearance to equestrian perniosis, it is not associated with cold exposure or prolonged pressure.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Equestrian perniosis.

**Answer**: B. Pyoderma gangrenosum

Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare, necrotizing skin condition that is often associated with underlying systemic diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, hematological malignancies, and autoimmune disorders. The patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis and chronic kidney disease, as well as the presence of pitting edema and negative Homans sign, suggest that the patient may have an underlying systemic condition that is contributing to the development of the ulcers.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are also consistent with pyoderma gangrenosum. The painful, gradually expanding ulcers on the left lower leg, with a keratotic plaque and central ulceration, are typical of pyoderma gangrenosum. The surrounding erythema and pitting edema are also consistent with this diagnosis.

The negative fungal and bacterial cultures suggest that the ulcers are not infected, which is consistent with pyoderma gangrenosum, as it is not an infectious condition. The elevated rheumatoid factor and negative other laboratory data also support this diagnosis, as pyoderma gangrenosum is often associated with autoimmune disorders.

The punch biopsy specimen showed a granulomatous reaction, which is consistent with pyoderma gangrenosum. The periodic acid-Schiff stain and hematoxylin-eosin stain also support this diagnosis, as they showed evidence of granulomatous inflammation and necrosis.

In contrast, blastomycosis, atypical mycobacterial infection, and ecthyma gangrenosum are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Blastomycosis is a fungal infection that typically presents with skin lesions and respiratory symptoms, but the patient's negative fungal cultures and lack of respiratory symptoms make this diagnosis less likely. Atypical mycobacterial infection is also less likely, as the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings

**Answer**: D. Nodular amyloid

The correct answer is D. Nodular amyloid because it matches the clinical presentation and histopathological features described in the case.

A. Pseudolymphoma is an incorrect choice because it is a lymphocytic infiltrate of the skin that mimics lymphoma. While it may have a similar appearance to the cobblestoned plaque described in the case, it is not associated with amyloid deposition.

B. Elephantiasis nostras verrucosa is an incorrect choice because it is a rare condition characterized by verrucous lesions on the legs, associated with chronic lymphedema. The clinical presentation and histopathological features described in the case do not match this condition.

C. Plantar cerebriform collagenoma is an incorrect choice because it is a rare benign tumor of the dermis and subcutaneous tissue that presents as a firm, painless nodule on the plantar surface of the foot. While it may have a similar appearance to the cobblestoned plaque described in the case, it is not associated with amyloid deposition.

D. Nodular amyloid is the correct answer because it is a condition characterized by the deposition of amyloid in the dermis, leading to the formation of firm, waxy, and asymptomatic plaques. The clinical presentation and histopathological features described in the case, including the smooth-surfaced cobblestoned plaque and the diffuse infiltrate of pale eosinophilic material with prominent clefts, are consistent with nodular amyloid. The Congo red stain (original magnification ×200) also supports this diagnosis, as it highlights the amyloid deposits.

**Answer**: C. Scurvy

Scurvy is a disease caused by a lack of vitamin C in the diet. It can cause a range of symptoms, including fatigue, weakness, bleeding gums, joint pain, and swelling. The patient in the case presentation has several of these symptoms, including bilateral lower extremity edema, ecchymoses, and arthralgias, which are consistent with scurvy. The patient's history of dental problems and recent antibiotic use also suggest a possible vitamin C deficiency.

**Answer**: A. Leukemia

Leukemia is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone marrow. While it can cause a range of symptoms, including fatigue, fever, and joint pain, it is not typically associated with the specific symptoms described in the case presentation. The patient's age and lack of family history of coagulation disorders also make leukemia less likely.

**Answer**: B. Henoch-Schonlein purpura

Henoch-Schonlein purpura is a vasculitis that affects the skin and joints. It is often associated with abdominal pain, joint pain, and skin lesions. While the patient's joint pain and skin lesions are consistent with Henoch-Schonlein purpura, the patient's history of dental problems and recent antibiotic use suggest a possible vitamin C deficiency, which is not typically associated with Henoch-Schonlein purpura.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a systemic vasculitis that can affect multiple organs, including the lungs, kidneys, and joints. It is often associated with symptoms such as fever, fatigue, and joint pain. While the patient's joint pain and abdominal discomfort are consistent with granulomatosis with polyangiitis, the patient's history of dental problems and recent antibiotic use suggest a possible vitamin C deficiency, which is not typically associated with granulomatosis with polyangiitis.

**Answer**: C. Body packing

The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, tenderness in the hypogastric region, and absence of bowel movements for 5 days, along with the absence of any other abnormalities on physical examination and laboratory tests, suggest that the patient may have a bowel obstruction. The fact that the patient did not complain of nausea or vomiting and did not have any abdominal distension, guarding, or rebound tenderness also support this diagnosis.

The axial contrast CT scan of the abdomen did not show any abnormal intestinal air-fluid levels or free peritoneal air, which rules out the possibility of a bowel obstruction caused by adhesion band or internal hernia (choice A and B).

The patient's history of substance abuse and the presence of a rectal mass on the CT scan suggest the possibility of body packing, which is the insertion of drugs or other foreign materials into the rectum for the purpose of concealing them from law enforcement or smuggling them into a prison. This can cause bowel obstruction and other complications.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Body packing.

It's worth noting that the patient's history of substance abuse and the presence of a rectal mass on the CT scan are not definitive diagnostic findings for body packing, and further evaluation and investigation are needed to confirm the diagnosis.

The correct answer is D. Nodular melanoma.

A. Cavernous lymphangioma: This is an incorrect choice because cavernous lymphangioma is a rare benign tumor that typically occurs in the neck, axilla, or inguinal region. It is usually a slow-growing, painless mass that does not bleed or change in size over time. The patient's history of rapid growth, pain, and bleeding, as well as the friable and fungating nature of the lesion, are not consistent with cavernous lymphangioma.

B. Nodular basal cell carcinoma: This is an incorrect choice because nodular basal cell carcinoma typically presents as a flesh-colored or pink nodule, rather than a purplish, fungating mass. Additionally, nodular basal cell carcinoma tends to be less aggressive than other types of skin cancer and is unlikely to cause significant pain or bleeding.

C. Squamous cell carcinoma: This is an incorrect choice because squamous cell carcinoma typically presents as a firm, flat, or slightly raised lesion, rather than a multilobulated, fungating mass. Additionally, squamous cell carcinoma tends to be more common in sun-exposed areas, such as the face, ears, and hands, rather than the back.

D. Nodular melanoma: This is the correct choice because it is consistent with the patient's history of rapid growth, pain, and bleeding, as well as the friable and fungating nature of the lesion. Nodular melanoma is a highly aggressive form of skin cancer that can grow rapidly and invade surrounding tissues, leading to significant morbidity and mortality if left untreated. The patient's history of frequent outdoor sun exposure and the presence of a palpable mass in the left axilla also support this diagnosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Nodular melanoma.

**Answer**: B. Emergent stenting of the left main coronary artery

The patient presented with progressive dyspnea and fatigue, and the diagnosis of an atrial septal defect and pulmonary hypertension was made. During the cardiac catheterization, diffuse 90% to 95% narrowing of the left main coronary artery at its origin was discovered, which led to the development of deep ST-segment depressions associated with chest and throat pain. The patient then developed ventricular tachycardia requiring cardioversion and intravenous amiodarone and lidocaine. The patient became unstable with recurrent episodes of ventricular tachycardia/fibrillation requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation. An intra-aortic balloon pump was emergently placed, and the patient was intubated.

Given the patient's symptoms and diagnosis, emergent stenting of the left main coronary artery is the most appropriate next step. The patient's chest pain and ST-segment depressions suggest that there is a significant blockage in the left main coronary artery, which is causing myocardial ischemia. The narrowing of the left main coronary artery at its origin suggests that the blockage is likely due to atherosclerosis. Emergent stenting can help to open up the blockage and restore blood flow to the myocardium, which can help to relieve the patient's symptoms and prevent further cardiac damage.

The other options are not as appropriate for several reasons:

A. Emergent coronary artery bypass graft surgery: While coronary artery bypass graft surgery may be necessary in some cases, it is not the most appropriate next step in this situation. The patient's symptoms and diagnosis suggest that the blockage in the left main coronary artery is acute and requires immediate attention. Emergent stenting is a less invasive procedure that can be performed quickly and effectively to open up the blockage.

C. Emergent closure of the atrial septal defect: While the atrial septal defect may need to be closed, it is not the

**Answer**: C. Thyroid cartilage fracture

The patient's symptoms of sudden voice change, odynophagia, and left-sided neck pain following a sneeze, along with the physical examination findings of tenderness over the thyroid notch and left side of the laryngotracheal complex, are consistent with a thyroid cartilage fracture. The fact that the patient experienced a popping sensation during the sneeze and neck stiffness 15 minutes later also supports this diagnosis.

A thyroid cartilage fracture occurs when there is a break in the cartilage that surrounds the thyroid gland. This can cause pain and swelling in the neck, difficulty swallowing, and changes in the voice. In this case, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a thyroid cartilage fracture.

The other answer choices are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

A. Ruptured vocal fold hemangioma: A hemangioma is a benign growth of blood vessels. While it can cause voice changes and neck pain, it would not cause the sudden onset of symptoms following a sneeze, and it would not result in tenderness over the thyroid notch.

B. Rupture of laryngocele: A laryngocele is a cyst-like structure that can form in the larynx. While it can cause voice changes and neck pain, it would not cause the sudden onset of symptoms following a sneeze, and it would not result in tenderness over the thyroid notch.

D. Traumatic intubation: Traumatic intubation occurs when a tube is inserted into the trachea during anesthesia, causing damage to the surrounding tissues. While it can cause voice changes and neck pain, it would not cause the sudden onset of symptoms following a sneeze, and it would not result in tenderness over the thyroid notch.

**Answer**: C. Glomus tumor

The patient's symptoms and the location of the mass suggest a glomus tumor. Glomus tumors are rare, benign growths that originate from the glomus cells that line the trachea. They typically present with symptoms such as coughing, wheezing, and stridor, which are absent in this case. However, the patient's age and the location of the mass are consistent with glomus tumors.

The patient underwent tracheostomy and complete excision via a transtracheal approach, which is the standard treatment for glomus tumors. The histopathologic images shown in the question (Figure, B-D) demonstrate a typical glomus tumor with a characteristic "salt and pepper" appearance.

Now, let's discuss why the other answer choices are incorrect:

A. Superior laryngeal nerve schwannoma: This is a benign tumor that originates from the Schwann cells of the superior laryngeal nerve. It is unlikely that a schwannoma would present with a tracheal mass, as they typically occur in the larynx or hypopharynx. Moreover, the patient's symptoms and age do not fit the profile of a schwannoma patient.

B. Carcinoid tumor: Carcinoid tumors are rare, malignant tumors that originate from the neuroendocrine cells of the trachea. They typically present with symptoms such as dyspnea, coughing, and wheezing, which are not present in this case. Additionally, carcinoid tumors tend to be larger than glomus tumors and would likely cause more significant airway obstruction.

D. Paraganglioma: Paragangliomas are rare, benign tumors that originate from the paraganglia, which are clusters of cells located near the sympathetic trunk.

**Answer**:C. Fibrovascular polyp

The correct answer is C. Fibrovascular polyp. A fibrovascular polyp is a benign growth that originates from the connective tissue in the esophagus. It is characterized by a pedunculated or sessile mass that protrudes into the esophageal lumen. The patient's symptoms of iron deficiency anemia and positive fecal occult blood test are consistent with a bleeding polyp. The patient's history of long-standing diabetes, coronary artery disease, and chronic renal failure also increases the likelihood of a bleeding polyp.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Squamous papilloma: A squamous papilloma is a benign growth that originates from the squamous epithelium in the esophagus. It is typically found in the upper esophagus and is less likely to cause bleeding.

B. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST): A GIST is a rare tumor that originates from the interstitial cells of Cajal in the digestive tract. It can occur in the esophagus but is more commonly found in the stomach and small intestine. GISTs are typically larger than fibrovascular polyps and have a more irregular surface.

D. Lipoma: A lipoma is a benign tumor composed of fat cells. It is rare in the esophagus and would not explain the patient's symptoms of bleeding.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and the results of the upper endoscopy and computed tomographic scan, the most likely diagnosis is a fibrovascular polyp.

**Answer**:C. Obtain carotid Doppler

The case presented is a 64-year-old man with a 2-month history of blurred vision in his right eye, with findings of unilateral vision loss, mild venous engorgement, and peripheral dot-blot retinal hemorrhages. The patient has a history of hypercholesterolemia. The differential diagnosis for this presentation includes central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), which is a common cause of unilateral vision loss. However, the presence of peripheral dot-blot hemorrhages and mild venous engorgement raises the possibility of a carotid artery disease.

Option A, "Observe," is not the best choice as it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Observation may be appropriate for cases of CRVO without any evidence of carotid artery disease, but in this case, the presence of peripheral hemorrhages and mild venous engorgement warrants further investigation.

Option B, "Perform panretinal photocoagulation," is also not the best choice. Panretinal photocoagulation is a treatment for retinal diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, and retinal tears. While it may be considered in cases of CRVO, it is not the first step in the management of this patient's condition. The patient's symptoms and findings suggest a possible carotid artery disease, which should be evaluated first.

Option D, "Refer to cardiology," may be appropriate eventually, but it is not the most appropriate next step. The patient's symptoms and findings suggest a possible carotid artery disease, and a carotid Doppler study is the appropriate test to evaluate this. A carotid Doppler study can help determine the presence and severity of carotid artery stenosis, which can cause CRVO.

Therefore, the best answer is option C, "Obtain carotid Doppler." This test can help confirm or rule out the presence of carotid artery disease and guide further management. If the carotid Doppler study shows significant stenosis

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is D. Discontinue treatment with amantadine.

Amantadine is a medication that is sometimes associated with a side effect called "oculogyric crisis," which can cause bilateral blurred vision, diplopia, and oculocutaneous flushing. The patient's recent-onset bilateral blurred vision, in the absence of any other ocular findings, suggests that the amantadine may be the cause of her symptoms. Therefore, discontinuing the medication is the appropriate next step in management.

The other options are not appropriate for the following reasons:

A. Bilateral Descemet stripping endothelial keratoplasty is a surgical procedure that is used to treat endothelial dysfunction, which is not the likely cause of the patient's symptoms. The patient's central corneal thickness is within normal limits, and there are no signs of keratic precipitates or anterior chamber cells, which suggests that the endothelium is functioning properly.

B. Corneal topography is a diagnostic test that is used to assess the shape and curvature of the cornea. While it may be useful in evaluating the patient's corneal edema, it is not the most appropriate next step in management.

C. Observe is not a suitable option because the patient's symptoms are persistent and the underlying cause needs to be investigated and treated appropriately.

Therefore, the best answer is D. Discontinue treatment with amantadine.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is C: Perform endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy and prescribe antibiotics.

Let's go through each answer choice and explain why it's incorrect or correct:

A: Perform a biopsy of the mass.

While a biopsy may be necessary to determine the nature of the mass, it's not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest an infectious etiology, and a biopsy would not provide immediate relief for the patient's symptoms. Additionally, a biopsy may not be feasible given the location of the mass and the risk of damaging surrounding tissues.

B: Perform magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits and maxillofacial region.

MRI is a valuable diagnostic tool, but it's not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with an infectious process, and MRI may not provide the necessary information to guide immediate management. Additionally, MRI may not be able to differentiate between an inflammatory and infectious process.

D: Prescribe topical and systemic antibiotics and recommend use of warm compresses without planned surgical or procedural intervention.

This option is incorrect because while antibiotics may be appropriate for treating an infectious process, they may not be effective in managing the patient's symptoms in a timely manner. The patient's persistent pain and swelling suggest a more urgent intervention may be necessary. Additionally, warm compresses may not be sufficient to manage the patient's symptoms.

C: Perform endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy and prescribe antibiotics.

This option is correct because it addresses the likely infectious etiology of the patient's symptoms and provides immediate relief. Endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) is a minimally invasive procedure that can drain the abscess and help relieve the patient's symptoms. Antibiotics may also be prescribed to treat any residual infection. This option provides a comprehensive approach to

**Answer**:B. Genetic testing

The patient's symptoms of progressively declining, blurred vision, and dysarthria, along with the mild mottled retinal pigment epithelial abnormalities and disruption of the interdigitation and ellipsoid zones subfoveally on retinal spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, suggest a possible diagnosis of a retinal degenerative disorder. The absence of a family history of similar symptoms or retinal degeneration reduces the likelihood of an inherited retinal degeneration. However, it is still possible that the patient may have a genetic predisposition to a retinal degenerative disorder, which could be identified through genetic testing.

Option A, MRI of the brain/orbits with contrast, may be useful in evaluating the patient's postconcussion symptoms, such as headaches and dizziness, but it is not directly related to the patient's vision loss.

Option C, Lumbar puncture, may be useful in evaluating the patient's postconcussion symptoms, such as headaches and dizziness, but it is not directly related to the patient's vision loss.

Option D, Audiogram, is not relevant to the patient's vision loss and is not indicated at this time.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to perform genetic testing to determine if the patient has a genetic predisposition to a retinal degenerative disorder.

**Answer**: C. Hypertrophic lichen planus

The correct answer is C. Hypertrophic lichen planus because it best matches the clinical presentation and histopathological features described in the case.

A. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a malignant tumor that can arise from squamous epithelium, which is found in various parts of the body, including the skin and lungs. While SCC can present with various clinical features, the description of the plaques in this case does not suggest a typical presentation of SCC. SCC typically presents as a firm, painless nodule or ulcer on sun-exposed areas of the skin, and it may be associated with a history of tobacco use and sun exposure. In contrast, the patient in this case presented with multiple thick, mildly pruritic, yellow hyperkeratotic plaques on her lower extremities, which is not typical for SCC.

B. Plaque psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by thick, scaly, red, and sometimes itchy plaques on the skin. While plaque psoriasis can present with a similar appearance to the skin lesions described in this case, it is unlikely to be the correct diagnosis for several reasons. First, the patient's age is not typical for psoriasis, which usually presents in younger adults. Second, the patient has a history of lung cancer and is receiving immunotherapy, which increases the likelihood of immune-related adverse events. Finally, the histopathological features described in the case do not support a diagnosis of psoriasis.

D. Keratoacanthoma (KA) is a benign tumor that arises from the hair follicle and is characterized by a rapid growth of keratinocytes, resulting in a firm, painless nodule or plaque on the skin. While KA can present with a similar appearance to the skin lesions described in this case, it is unlikely to be the correct diagnosis for several reasons. First, KA typically presents as a solitary lesion, whereas the patient in this case had multiple plaques. Second, KA is usually found on sun-exposed areas of the skin, such as the face, ears,

**Answer**:C. Diagnose postinfectious altered bowel habits with C difficile colonization and recommend a high-fiber diet.

The correct answer is C. Diagnose postinfectious altered bowel habits with C difficile colonization and recommend a high-fiber diet.

The patient's symptoms of abdominal discomfort and increased stool frequency (4-5 Bristol type 4 stools per day) suggest postinfectious altered bowel habits, which can occur after a previous infection such as CDI. The patient's history of successful treatment of CDI with metronidazole and return to baseline bowel movement pattern also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the positive repeat stool test for C difficile toxin PCR suggests colonization, which can contribute to altered bowel habits.

A. Diagnose recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and prescribe metronidazole. is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and history do not suggest a recurrent CDI. The patient had a successful treatment of CDI with metronidazole and a return to baseline bowel movement pattern, making it less likely that the patient has a recurrent CDI.

B. Diagnose severe CDI and prescribe vancomycin. is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and history do not suggest a severe CDI. The patient had a mild CDI that was successfully treated with metronidazole, and there is no indication of severe disease or the need for vancomycin.

D. Diagnose refractory CDI and consider fecal microbiota transplantation. is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and history do not suggest refractory CDI. The patient had a successful treatment of CDI with metronidazole and a return to baseline bowel movement pattern, making it less likely that the patient has refractory CDI. Fecal microbiota transplantation is typically considered for patients with recurrent or refractory CDI who have failed multiple treatments, which is not the case for this patient.

**Answer**: D. Glomuvenous malformation (GVM)

The correct answer is D. Glomuvenous malformation (GVM) because it matches the patient's symptoms and clinical findings.

GVM is a rare vascular malformation characterized by clusters of small, painful papules on the skin, often with a bluish discoloration. The lesions are typically tender and compressible, which is consistent with the patient's complaints of pain and tenderness. The cobblestone-like appearance of the papules on the thigh and hand is also consistent with GVM.

Option A, blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome, is a rare condition characterized by multiple soft, bluish papules on the skin. However, it is not typically associated with pain or tenderness, and the papules are usually not compressible.

Option B, venous malformation, is a type of vascular malformation that can cause pain and swelling, but it typically appears as a soft, compressible mass rather than multiple discrete papules.

Option C, hemangioma, is a benign tumor of blood vessels that can cause pain and discomfort. However, it typically appears as a red or purple mass, rather than bluish papules.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and clinical findings, the most likely diagnosis is D. Glomuvenous malformation (GVM).

**Answer**:B. Hereditary progressive mucinous histiocytosis (HPMH).

The correct answer is B, Hereditary progressive mucinous histiocytosis (HPMH), for the following reasons:

* Hereditary progressive mucinous histiocytosis (HPMH) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple mucinous tumors, primarily in the skin and respiratory tract.
* The clinical presentation of HPMH includes the development of numerous papules and nodules on the skin, which can be skin-colored, erythematous, or brown. The lesions are usually distributed symmetrically on the face, trunk, and extremities, similar to the case described in the question.
* HPMH is a progressive disorder, meaning that the number and size of the lesions increase over time. This is consistent with the patient's history of the lesions being present since childhood and progressively increasing in number.
* The patient's family history, with a young brother having similar papular lesions, also supports the diagnosis of HPMH, as it is a genetic disorder that can be inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.
* The histopathological findings, as shown in the images provided (Figure, B-D), are consistent with HPMH. The presence of mucin-secreting cells and the absence of any other significant abnormalities support this diagnosis.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple fibrofolliculomas, trichodiscomas, and acrochordons. While it can present with skin lesions, the distribution and characteristics of the lesions are different from those described in the case.
* C. Multiple eruptive dermatofibromas are benign tumors that can present with numerous papules on the skin. However, they are usually not distributed symmetrically, and the patient's history of progressive increase in the number and size of lesions does not fit with this diagnosis.

**Answer**: D. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis

The patient's symptoms and findings, including fever, weight loss, productive cough, cutaneous ulcers, and elevated inflammatory markers, suggest a systemic inflammatory disorder. The positive c-ANCA test and the presence of lung cancer suggest a diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis. GPA is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the blood vessels and can cause a wide range of symptoms, including skin ulcers, lung involvement, and kidney damage. The patient's history of smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may also increase the risk of developing GPA.

The other options are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and findings:

A. Disseminated tuberculosis: Tuberculosis can cause skin ulcers, but the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not suggest this diagnosis. The patient's age, lack of exposure to tuberculosis, and negative chest x-ray 6 months prior make tuberculosis less likely.

B. Paraneoplastic pyoderma gangrenosum: Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare skin disorder associated with certain cancers, including lung cancer. However, the patient's skin ulcers are not typical of pyoderma gangrenosum, which usually presents with painful, necrotic ulcers with undermined borders. The patient's history of smoking and COPD also makes lung cancer less likely.

C. Disseminated nocardiosis: Nocardiosis is a rare infection caused by the bacteria Nocardia. While nocardiosis can cause skin ulcers, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not suggest this diagnosis. The patient's age and history of smoking and COPD also increase the risk of lung cancer and GPA, rather than nocardiosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis.

**Answer**: B. Multiple cavernous malformations

The correct answer is B. Multiple cavernous malformations because the patient's symptoms and MRI findings are consistent with this diagnosis. Cavernous malformations are abnormalities in the blood vessels of the brain that can cause a range of symptoms, including weakness, numbness, and difficulty with coordination and balance. The patient's sudden onset of severe neck pain, followed by rapid progression of weakness and sensory impairment in the right arm and leg, as well as the presence of multiple abnormal signals throughout the brain on MRI, are all consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's history of hypertension and diabetes may also increase the risk of developing cavernous malformations.

A. Amyloid angiopathy is an incorrect choice because, while it can cause similar symptoms, it is typically associated with deposition of amyloid protein in the walls of blood vessels, which is not mentioned in the patient's MRI findings.

C. Metastatic melanoma is an incorrect choice because there is no mention of a history of melanoma or any other cancer in the patient's history, and the MRI findings do not suggest a metastatic lesion.

D. Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy is an incorrect choice because, while it can cause similar symptoms, it is a rare genetic disorder that typically affects younger individuals and is characterized by recurrent stroke-like episodes, which is not mentioned in the patient's history.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and MRI findings, the most likely diagnosis is B. Multiple cavernous malformations.

**Answer**: C. Herpes zoster

Herpes zoster, also known as shingles, is a viral infection that causes a painful rash with blisters. It is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, which is the same virus that causes chickenpox. In this case, the patient's rash and symptoms are consistent with herpes zoster. The clusters of monomorphic pink to violaceous papulovesicles with surrounding erythema and central punctate hemorrhagic crust are characteristic of herpes zoster. Additionally, the fact that the rash did not bleed, ulcerate, weep, or appear itchy or painful, and the patient did not have a fever, are also consistent with herpes zoster.

Now, let's discuss why the other answer choices are incorrect:

A. Microcystic lymphatic malformation: This is a rare congenital condition characterized by abnormal development of the lymphatic vessels. It typically presents with small, soft, flesh-colored or bluish papules or nodules on the skin. The lesions are usually not tender and may have a characteristic "spider-web" or "cobblestone" appearance. While this condition can present with similar-looking lesions, it is not associated with a viral infection like herpes zoster.

B. Eczema herpeticum: This is a rare condition that occurs when eczema (atopic dermatitis) becomes infected with the herpes simplex virus. It typically presents with small, fluid-filled blisters that crust over and form scaling, oozing, and itching. The rash can be widespread and may involve the face, trunk, and limbs. While eczema herpeticum can cause a similar-looking rash, it is not associated with the varicella-zoster virus like herpes zoster.

D. Hypersensitivity reaction: This occurs when the body's immune system overreacts to a substance, leading to inflammation and skin symptoms. It can cause a variety of skin lesions, including hives, itching, and blisters.

**Answer**:B. Liposarcoma

The patient's symptoms, such as abdominal discomfort, an increasingly large recurrent umbilical hernia, night sweats, weight loss, and leukocytosis, are consistent with a retroperitoneal mass. The patient's history of smoking and alcohol consumption may also suggest a malignancy.

The patient's laboratory results, particularly the leukocytosis and hyponatremia, are consistent with a malignancy. The patient's bone marrow biopsy results, which showed a hypercellular marrow with a myeloid left shift but no increase in blasts or dyspoiesis, are also consistent with a malignancy.

The patient's computed tomography (CT) scan results, which revealed splenomegaly, hydronephrosis, and a 25-cm left-sided retroperitoneal mass, are consistent with a retroperitoneal tumor. The mass encasement of the left kidney is also consistent with a retroperitoneal tumor.

Given the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is a retroperitoneal tumor. Of the answer choices provided, the most appropriate diagnosis is B. Liposarcoma, as it is a rare malignant tumor that can arise in the retroperitoneum and can cause symptoms such as abdominal discomfort, weight loss, and leukocytosis.

Adrenocortical carcinoma (choice A) is a rare malignancy that can arise in the adrenal cortex and can cause symptoms such as abdominal discomfort, weight loss, and hypertension.

**Answer**: B. Internal hernia of the cecum

The correct answer is B, Internal hernia of the cecum, because it best fits the symptoms and findings described in the case.

An internal hernia occurs when a portion of the intestine slides into another portion, creating a loop that can cause obstruction or strangulation. In this case, the distended cecum in the left upper quadrant suggests that the cecum has herniated through a defect in the peritoneum, which is the lining of the abdominal cavity. This type of hernia is often referred to as a "sliding hernia."

The patient's symptoms of acute-onset, diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, and retching are consistent with an internal hernia, as they indicate that there is a blockage or obstruction in the intestine. The absence of peritoneal signs, such as guarding or rebound tenderness, also supports the diagnosis of an internal hernia, as these signs are typically absent in cases of non-strangulating obstruction.

The other answer choices do not fit the symptoms and findings of the case as well as choice B.

A. Cecal volvulus: A cecal volvulus occurs when the cecum twists around its mesentery, cutting off blood flow to the intestine. This can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, but it is unlikely to cause a distended cecum in the left upper quadrant, as the twisting of the cecum would likely cause the intestine to become gangrenous and dilated, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

C. Intestinal malrotation: Intestinal malrotation is a congenital condition in which the intestine is not properly rotated during fetal development, leading to abnormal positioning of the intestine. This can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, but it is unlikely to cause a distended cecum in the left upper quadrant, as the malrotation would likely cause the int

**Answer**:C. Order B-scan ultrasonography or fundus autofluorescence imaging of optic nerves

The correct answer is C. Order B-scan ultrasonography or fundus autofluorescence imaging of optic nerves, because it is the most appropriate next step in the evaluation of this patient's abnormal optic nerves.

B-scan ultrasonography is a non-invasive imaging technique that uses high-frequency sound waves to produce detailed cross-sectional images of the eye and orbit. It can help to identify any structural abnormalities of the optic nerve, such as tumors, cysts, or inflammation, which may be causing the patient's symptoms.

Fundus autofluorescence imaging is a non-invasive imaging technique that uses a specialized camera to capture images of the retina and optic disc in the dark. It can help to identify any abnormalities in the retina and optic disc, such as damage to the retinal cells or optic nerve, which may be causing the patient's symptoms.

Ordering magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits (choice A) may also be appropriate, but it is not the most specific or targeted test for evaluating the patient's symptoms. MRI can help to identify any intracranial or orbital abnormalities that may be causing the patient's symptoms, but it may not provide as much detail about the optic nerves specifically as B-scan ultrasonography or fundus autofluorescence imaging.

Ordering a lumbar puncture with opening pressure (choice B) is not the most appropriate next step in the evaluation of this patient. While a lumbar puncture can help to diagnose conditions such as idiopathic intracranial hypertension, which may cause similar symptoms, it is not as targeted or specific as the other imaging tests mentioned. Additionally, it is an invasive procedure that carries some risks, so it should only be considered after other, less invasive tests have been performed.

**Answer**:B. Lymph node biopsy

The case presented is a 64-year-old man with bilateral anterior uveitis unresponsive to treatment with topical steroids, worsening uveitis, and ocular hypertension. The patient had a history of bilateral recurrent gingivitis with persistent reactive lymphadenopathy of the head and neck unresponsive to treatment with systemic antibiotics. The patient's visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/200 OS, and intraocular pressures were 17 and 32 mm Hg, respectively. On slitlamp examination, both eyes were markedly hyperemic with diffuse corneal stromal edema, and his anterior chambers were deep with 3+ OD and 4+ OS cell and mixed hypopyon and hyphema in each eye. His dilated fundus examination findings were remarkable only for an area of retinal pigment epithelial stippling inferonasal to the macula in the left eye, without any vitritis in either eye. He did not have any skin or mucocutaneous lesions, but he had extensive bilateral preauricular, submental, posterior occipital, and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy.

Given the patient's history and clinical presentation, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a lymph node biopsy. This is because the patient has persistent reactive lymphadenopathy of the head and neck, which could be related to an underlying systemic infection or inflammatory condition. The patient's bilateral anterior uveitis and ocular hypertension may also be related to this underlying condition. A lymph node biopsy would help to establish a diagnosis and guide further management.

The other options are not as appropriate for the following reasons:

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is C. Obtain consultation for urgent surgical valve replacement.

The patient presented with worsening exertional dyspnea, which culminated in multiple recurrent admissions for decompensated heart failure requiring intravenous diuretics. The transthoracic echocardiogram suggested a significantly elevated gradient across the mitral prosthesis, and the transesophageal echocardiogram demonstrated complete immobilization of one mechanical leaflet and impaired excursion of the other leaflet with subsequent severe mitral stenosis. These findings suggest that the patient has a severely stenotic mitral valve prosthesis, which is likely causing the patient's symptoms.

Administering intravenous unfractionated heparin for presumed prosthetic valve thrombosis (choice A) may be appropriate for a patient with a prosthetic valve who has symptoms suggestive of thrombosis, such as sudden onset of severe left ventricular dysfunction, but it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient. The patient's symptoms are more consistent with severe mitral stenosis, and there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has a thrombus in the prosthetic valve.

Administering intravenous thrombolysis for presumed prosthetic valve thrombosis (choice B) is also not the most appropriate choice for this patient. While thrombolysis may be considered in certain cases of prosthetic valve thrombosis, it is not the first-line treatment for severe mitral stenosis. In addition, thrombolysis carries a risk of bleeding complications, which may be particularly problematic in a patient with a history of bleeding complications on warfarin therapy.

Starting empirical antibiotics for prosthetic valve endocarditis (choice D) is not the most appropriate choice for this patient. While endocarditis is a potential complication of prosthetic valves, there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has endocarditis. The patient's symptoms are more consistent with severe mitral stenosis, and there is no evidence of infection.

A tracheocele is a rare condition where a cystic mass forms in the trachea, which can cause symptoms such as dysphagia, dysphonia, and tracheal deviation, as seen in this patient. The imaging findings also match, as the mass is seen to arise from the right thyroid fossa and displace the trachea to the left, with a large air-filled cavity communicating with the right posterolateral aspect of the trachea.

The other answer choices do not fit the patient's symptoms and imaging findings as well.

A. Apical lung bulla/bleb is a rare condition where a cystic mass forms in the lung, usually in the apical region. While it can cause similar symptoms, it would not explain the displacement of the trachea or the communication with the trachea seen in this patient's imaging.

C. Laryngocele is a rare condition where a cystic mass forms in the larynx. While it can cause dysphonia and other respiratory symptoms, it would not explain the tracheal deviation or the imaging findings seen in this patient.

D. Zenker diverticulum is a rare condition where a pouch-like structure forms in the esophagus, usually in the distal third. While it can cause dysphagia and other respiratory symptoms, it would not explain the tracheal deviation or the imaging findings seen in this patient.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is B. Tracheocele.

A. Laryngeal sarcoid is an inflammatory disease that affects the larynx and can cause hoarseness, stridor, and respiratory obstruction. However, it is unlikely in this case because the patient is an infant, and sarcoidosis is rare in this age group.

B. Granular cell tumor is a rare benign tumor that can occur in the larynx. It is characterized by the presence of small, round cells with a distinctive granular appearance. However, the patient's symptoms and the findings on direct laryngoscopy and MRI do not support this diagnosis.

C. Laryngeal rhabdomyosarcoma is a rare malignant tumor that can occur in the larynx. It is characterized by the presence of pleomorphic cells with a variable number of mitoses. The patient's symptoms and the findings on direct laryngoscopy and MRI do not support this diagnosis.

D. Laryngeal neurofibroma is a benign tumor that arises from the neural crest cells of the larynx. It is characterized by the presence of bundles of spindle cells with angulated nuclei in a stroma of variable coarse collagen and loose myxoid matrix. The patient's symptoms, such as hoarseness and stridor, and the findings on direct laryngoscopy and MRI, such as a submucosal lesion of the left aryepiglottic fold extending inferiorly to the level of the arytenoid, are consistent with this diagnosis.

**Answer**: A. Submandibular duct sialocele

The correct answer is A. Submandibular duct sialocele because it most closely matches the patient's symptoms and the results of the imaging studies.

A sialocele is a dilated segment of a salivary duct that can occur due to obstruction or injury. In this case, the patient had a high-grade stricture approximately 3 to 4 cm into the right submandibular duct orifice, which prevented evaluation of the proximal duct and intraglandular portions. This suggests that there was an obstruction in the duct, leading to dilatation of the distal portion.

The patient's symptoms of right submandibular swelling and pain, associated with eating and relieved by gland massage, are consistent with a sialocele. The fact that no saliva was expressed on examination also supports this diagnosis, as the obstruction in the duct prevented saliva from being secreted.

The other answer choices do not fit the patient's symptoms and imaging results as well.

B. Lymphangioma is a benign tumor of the lymphatic vessels, but it does not explain the patient's symptoms of swelling and pain in the floor of mouth, nor does it match the imaging findings of a dilated submandibular duct.

While this could be a possible diagnosis, it does not explain the patient's symptoms of swelling and pain, nor does it match the imaging findings of a high-grade stricture in the submandibular duct.

D. Abscess is a collection of pus that forms as a result of an infection. While the patient did develop a cystic lesion in the right sublingual space after "burning her mouth" with high-temperature food, this is not consistent with an abscess, as there is no evidence of infection.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is D. Necrotic epiglottitis.

Necrotic epiglottitis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the epiglottis, the cartilaginous structure that covers the glottis, becomes inflamed and necrotic. This can lead to airway obstruction and respiratory failure.

The patient's symptoms of progressive sore throat, dysphagia, fever, and dyspnea, as well as the physical examination findings of erythema and edema of the epiglottis with patchy necrosis, are consistent with necrotic epiglottitis. The patient's history of ulcerative colitis and recent treatment with oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid also support this diagnosis, as necrotic epiglottitis is a known complication of ulcerative colitis and can be triggered by bacterial infections.

The other answer choices are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

A. Candidosis, or thrush, is a fungal infection that can cause symptoms such as dysphagia and odynophagia, but it does not typically cause fever or respiratory distress. The patient's history of ulcerative colitis and recent antibiotic use also reduce the likelihood of candidosis.

B. Diphtheric laryngitis is a bacterial infection that can cause a sore throat and fever, but it does not typically cause dysphagia or respiratory distress. The patient's history of ulcerative colitis and recent antibiotic use also reduce the likelihood of diphtheric laryngitis.

C. Pseudomembranous epiglottitis is a bacterial infection that can cause symptoms such as sore throat, fever, and dysphagia, but it does not typically cause respiratory distress or necrosis of the epiglottis. The patient's history of ulcerative colitis and recent antibiotic use also reduce the likelihood

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is C: Administer methylprednisolone, 1 g intravenously daily.

The patient's symptoms of decreased vision and cognitive decline, along with the physical examination findings of rubeosis iridis, neovascularization of the optic disc, retinal vasculitis, venous sheathing, and dusky-appearing peripheral retina, suggest a diagnosis of posterior scleritis. This is a rare inflammatory condition that affects the posterior segment of the eye, including the retina and choroid.

Posterior scleritis can be associated with various systemic autoimmune diseases, such as polyarteritis nodosa, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis. The patient's history of renal cell carcinoma and recent nephrectomy suggest that the posterior scleritis may be related to an underlying autoimmune disorder.

Methylprednisolone, a corticosteroid, is the first-line treatment for posterior scleritis. It is effective in reducing inflammation and preventing further damage to the retina and choroid. The recommended dose is 1 g intravenously daily for 3-5 days, followed by oral prednisone 1-2 mg/kg daily for several weeks or months.

Now, let's discuss why the other choices are incorrect:

A: Panretinal photocoagulation is a treatment for retinal diseases that involve the peripheral retina, such as retinal detachment, retinal vein occlusion, and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. It is not the first-line treatment for posterior scleritis, which primarily affects the central retina and choroid.

B: Checking antinuclear antibodies, anticardiolipin antibodies, anti–double-stranded DNA antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and angiotensin-converting enzyme may help diagnose an underlying autoimmune disorder, but it is not the most appropriate next step

**Answer**:C. Refer for magnetic resonance imaging

The patient's symptoms and findings on examination suggest a possible intracranial cause for her symptoms, such as a tumor or aneurysm. MRI is the imaging modality of choice for evaluating intracranial structures and can help identify any abnormalities in the brain or surrounding tissues that may be causing her symptoms.

Option A, complete blood cell count, may be useful in identifying certain systemic conditions that could be contributing to her symptoms, such as anemia or infection, but it is not directly related to the patient's symptoms of foggy vision and headaches.

Option B, genetic testing, may be appropriate if there is a strong family history of certain genetic conditions that could be related to the patient's symptoms, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case.

Option D, perform retinal biopsy, is not necessary at this time, as the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a possible intracranial cause, rather than a retinal condition. Additionally, biopsy carries risks and is typically reserved for cases where the diagnosis is uncertain after other diagnostic tests have been performed.

Therefore, the correct answer is C, Refer for magnetic resonance imaging.

**Answer**:B. Add trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMZ) and corticosteroids

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest respiratory failure due to Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP). PJP is a common complication in patients with hematologic malignancies, especially those who have undergone allogeneic stem cell transplantation. The patient's history of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, previous chemotherapy, and recent allogeneic SCT increase her risk for PJP. The patient's symptoms of fever, weakness, and dyspnea, along with the bilateral opacities on chest radiograph, are consistent with PJP. The patient's recent exposure to her son's cough and the lack of recent travel suggest that the infection is likely due to reactivation of a latent infection rather than a new exposure.

Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMZ) is the drug of choice for PJP prophylaxis and treatment. TMP/SMZ is effective against P. jirovecii and has been shown to reduce the risk of PJP in patients with hematologic malignancies. The addition of corticosteroids is also appropriate to reduce the inflammation associated with PJP.

Choice A, adding amikacin to cover multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter, is not appropriate because there is no evidence of Acinetobacter infection in this patient.

Choice C, switching vancomycin to linezolid for refractory methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia, is not appropriate because there is no evidence of MRSA pneumonia in this patient.

Choice D, adding liposomal amphotericin B to cover mucormycosis, is not appropriate because there is no evidence of mucormycosis in this patient. While mucormycosis is a possible complication in patients with hematologic malignancies, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not

**Answer**: C. Leukemia cutis (LC) is the correct answer.

Explanation:

A. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) skin infection: MRSA is a type of bacterial infection that is resistant to many antibiotics, including methicillin. While MRSA can cause skin infections, the patient's history of recurrent fever and the absence of any skin lesions or signs of infection on physical examination make it less likely that MRSA is the cause of the patient's symptoms. Additionally, the patient's recent allogeneic stem cell transplant and immunosuppressive therapy increase the risk of developing opportunistic infections, such as LC.

B. Candida tropicalis: Candida tropicalis is a type of fungal infection that can cause skin lesions. However, the patient's history of recurrent fever and the absence of any skin lesions or signs of infection on physical examination make it less likely that Candida tropicalis is the cause of the patient's symptoms. Additionally, the patient's recent allogeneic stem cell transplant and immunosuppressive therapy increase the risk of developing opportunistic infections, such as LC.

D. Disseminated coccidioidomycosis: Coccidioidomycosis is a fungal infection that can cause skin lesions and respiratory symptoms. However, the patient's history of recurrent fever and the absence of any skin lesions or signs of infection on physical examination make it less likely that coccidioidomycosis is the cause of the patient's symptoms. Additionally, the patient's recent allogeneic stem cell transplant and immunosuppressive therapy increase the risk of developing opportunistic infections, such as LC.

C. Leukemia cutis (LC): LC is a rare complication of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) that occurs when leukemic cells infiltrate the skin. The patient's history of relapsed AML monocytic type and the presence of skin lesions consistent with LC make it the most likely diagnosis

**Answer**: C. The patient has an intrinsic clotting factor inhibitor.

The correct answer is C, The patient has an intrinsic clotting factor inhibitor, because the patient's test results indicate a mixing study that is consistent with the presence of an intrinsic clotting factor inhibitor. The patient's prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and normal prothrombin time (PT) suggest a deficiency in the intrinsic coagulation pathway, which is consistent with the presence of an intrinsic clotting factor inhibitor. Additionally, the patient's negative test results for common and extrinsic clotting factor inhibitors support this diagnosis.

In contrast, answer A, The patient has a common clotting factor inhibitor, is incorrect because the patient's test results do not indicate the presence of a common clotting factor inhibitor. Answer B, The patient has an extrinsic clotting factor inhibitor, is also incorrect because the patient's test results do not indicate the presence of an extrinsic clotting factor inhibitor. Answer D, The patient does not have a clotting factor inhibitor, is incorrect because the patient's test results indicate the presence of an intrinsic clotting factor inhibitor.

**Answer**:D. Perform a diagnostic test to clarify the diagnosis

The patient in this case has a long history of thickened toenails, which could be caused by various conditions such as fungal infection, nail trauma, or genetic disorders. The patient's family history of similar symptoms suggests a possible genetic component. However, the patient has not had any previous diagnostic tests or treatments for her toenails.

Option A, treating the patient with an oral antifungal, may not be the best approach at this point. While fungal infection is a possible cause of thickened toenails, there are no signs of active infection such as redness, swelling, or discharge. Moreover, the patient has already used an over-the-counter antifungal cream intermittently without improvement.

Option B, reassuring the patient that no treatment is necessary, is not appropriate. The patient has a long history of symptoms that have not resolved with previous treatment, and it is important to determine the underlying cause to provide appropriate management.

Option C, treating the patient with a topical antifungal, may not be effective as the patient has already tried an over-the-counter antifungal cream without success. Moreover, topical antifungals may not penetrate the nail plate effectively, especially in cases of thickened nails.

Therefore, the best approach is to perform a diagnostic test to clarify the diagnosis. This could include a nail biopsy, nail culture, or other tests to determine the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, appropriate treatment can be initiated.

**Answer**: C. Glomus tumor

The patient's symptoms of intermittent pain, exacerbated by cold weather, and the physical examination findings of distal nail plate splitting with longitudinal erythronychia, are consistent with a glomus tumor. Glomus tumors are benign tumors that originate from the glomus cells, which are specialized cells located in the nail bed that regulate the temperature of the body. They are known to cause pain and discomfort, especially in response to cold temperatures. The patient's history of a fracture in the digit more than 30 years earlier also increases the likelihood of a glomus tumor, as trauma to the nail bed can lead to the development of these tumors.

The other answer choices are less likely to be the correct diagnosis for the following reasons:

A. Amelanotic melanoma: While melanoma can occur in the nail bed, it is less likely to cause the symptoms and physical examination findings described in the case. Amelanotic melanoma is a type of melanoma that lacks pigmentation, but it typically presents with a dark spot or band on the nail, which is not mentioned in the case.

B. Onychopapilloma: Onychopapilloma is a benign tumor of the nail bed, but it is typically associated with a painless, slow-growing nodule or papule on the nail bed, rather than the pain and splitting described in the case.

D. Squamous cell carcinoma in situ: Squamous cell carcinoma in situ is a type of skin cancer that can occur in the nail bed, but it is less likely to cause the symptoms and physical examination findings described in the case. It typically presents with a painless, slow-growing nodule or patch on the nail bed, rather than the splitting and pain described in the case.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is a glomus tumor.

**Answer**:B. Eruptive disseminated Spitz nevi

The patient's symptoms, such as the rapid spread of numerous small, dark papules across her body, including her palms, soles, and sclera, are consistent with eruptive disseminated Spitz nevi. The fact that some of the lesions are pruritic and can be removed by scratching, leaving behind a hyperpigmented macule, also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of a sunburn several weeks before the onset of the lesions suggests that the condition may be related to sun exposure.

Superficial spreading melanoma (choice A) is unlikely because the patient has no personal or family history of melanoma, and the lesions do not display the characteristic features of melanoma, such as irregular borders, variegated colors, or ulceration.

Dermatosis papulosa nigra (choice C) is a condition that typically affects darker-skinned individuals and is characterized by multiple small, dark papules on the face. While the patient does have dark skin, the widespread distribution of the papules across her body, including her palms, soles, and sclera, makes this diagnosis less likely.

Metastatic melanoma (choice D) is also unlikely given the patient's lack of personal or family history of melanoma and the absence of any suspicious moles or lesions on her skin.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, the most likely diagnosis is eruptive disseminated Spitz nevi.

**Answer**: D. Verrucous hemangioma

The correct answer is D. Verrucous hemangioma because it matches the clinical and histopathological features described in the case.

A. Malignant melanoma is an aggressive skin cancer that can present with a variety of clinical features, including a pigmented plaque or nodule. However, the clinical and histopathological features described in the case do not support this diagnosis. The patient's age and the absence of any other skin lesions argue against melanoma. Additionally, the histopathological features shown in Figure B and C, such as epidermal verrucous hyperplasia, acanthosis, papillomatosis, and hyperkeratosis overlying dilated vessels in the dermis, are not consistent with melanoma.

B. Verruca vulgaris, also known as a common wart, is a benign skin lesion caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). It typically presents as a rough, scaly papule or plaque on the hands or feet. While the patient's history of recurrent infections and oozing and bleeding after minimal trauma may be consistent with a viral etiology, the clinical and histopathological features described in the case do not support this diagnosis. The absence of koilocytosis, which is a characteristic histopathological feature of HPV-induced lesions, argues against verruca vulgaris.

C. Angiokeratoma circumscriptum is a benign vascular lesion that typically presents as a small, red to purple, well-defined papule or plaque on the skin. It is characterized by a proliferation of blood vessels in the dermis, which can lead to the formation of a verrucous surface. However, the clinical and histopathological features described in the case do not support this diagnosis.

**Answer**:B. Tuberculous spondylitis

The patient's symptoms of back pain, limited physical activity, and mild tenderness to palpation of the lumbar spine, along with the radiographic findings of a paravertebral mass, compression fracture, and bony erosion, are consistent with tuberculous spondylitis. This is a type of osteomyelitis that affects the spine and is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The patient's history of asthma and constipation may also be relevant to the patient's overall health and potential treatment plan, but they are not directly related to the likely diagnosis of tuberculous spondylitis.

The other options are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and radiographic findings:

A. Ewing sarcoma is a type of bone cancer that can cause back pain and radiographic abnormalities, but it is less likely in this case given the patient's age and lack of other symptoms such as fever or weight loss.

C. Discitis is an infection of the intervertebral disc that can cause back pain, but it is less likely in this case given the patient's age and the radiographic findings of a paravertebral mass and compression fracture.

D. Pyogenic osteomyelitis is a bacterial infection of the bone that can cause back pain and radiographic abnormalities, but it is less likely in this case given the patient's history of asthma and constipation, which suggest a chronic rather than acute infection. Additionally, the radiographic findings of a paravertebral mass and compression fracture are not typical of pyogenic osteomyelitis.

**Answer**: B. Thymolipoma

Thymolipoma is a rare benign tumor that originates from the thymus gland. It is composed of mature fat cells and usually presents as a slow-growing mass in the mediastinum. The patient's symptoms of new-onset progressive dizziness, lightheadedness, and shortness of breath, along with the physical examination findings of a positive Kussmaul sign and pulsus paradoxus, suggest compression of the superior vena cava and right ventricle by the tumor. The echocardiography findings of normal cardiac chambers and valves, along with the chest radiograph and computed tomographic imaging results, support the diagnosis of a mediastinal mass compressing the right cardiac structures. The fat attenuation and nodular densities within the mass are consistent with a thymolipoma.

Thymoma, choice A, is a malignant tumor that originates from the thymus gland. It can present with similar symptoms and findings as thymolipoma, but it is more aggressive and can infiltrate surrounding structures. The patient's symptoms and imaging results do not suggest a malignant tumor.

Mediastinal lipomatosis, choice C, is a rare condition characterized by the accumulation of fat in the mediastinum. It can cause compression of surrounding structures, including the superior vena cava and right ventricle. However, the patient's imaging results do not suggest a diffuse accumulation of fat in the mediastinum, but rather a well-circumscribed mass.

Myelolipoma, choice D, is a rare benign tumor that originates from the bone marrow. It is composed of mature fat cells and can present as a mass in various locations, including the mediastinum. However, the patient's symptoms and imaging results do not suggest a bone marrow origin for the tumor.

**Answer**: A. Right colon ischemia

The correct answer is A. Right colon ischemia because it is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and medical history. The patient's abdominal pain, distension, vomiting, and right lower quadrant tenderness are consistent with ischemia of the right colon. The fact that the patient had a recent embolization procedure to treat bleeding from a right colon arteriovenous malformation also supports this diagnosis. Embolization can cause ischemia or infarction of the affected tissue, especially if the embolization is not complete or if there is a delay in treatment.

The other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms. B. Endoscopic perforation is unlikely because the patient did not have any recent endoscopic procedures, and there is no evidence of perforation on the computed tomographic scan. C. Prolonged ileus secondary to retained intraluminal old blood is also unlikely because the patient did not have any evidence of ileus or bowel obstruction on the computed tomographic scan, and there is no mention of old blood in the patient's history. D. Diverticular perforation is unlikely because there is no mention of diverticulitis or perforation on the computed tomographic scan.

Therefore, A. Right colon ischemia is the most appropriate diagnosis for this patient's symptoms and medical history.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is C. Obtain urinalysis.

The patient's symptoms of subacute vision loss, fever, weakness, and decreased appetite, followed by persistent weight loss, suggest a possible systemic inflammatory response. The patient's history of recent ureterorenoscopies and ureteral stent placement, along with the presence of trace conjunctival hyperemia, occasional cells in the anterior chamber, and mild nuclear/cortical cataract, suggest a possible association with the patient's urinary tract procedures.

Urinalysis can help identify potential causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a urinary tract infection, kidney damage, or abnormalities in the urinary sediment. This information can guide further management and help determine if the patient's symptoms are related to the recent urologic procedures or if there is an underlying systemic condition that needs to be addressed.

In contrast, the other answer choices do not address the patient's systemic symptoms or potential urinary tract issues:

A. Intravitreal injection with vancomycin and ceftazidime would be appropriate for treating bacterial endophthalmitis, but there is no evidence of this condition in the patient's presentation.

B. Initiating uveitis workup and beginning topical glucocorticoid therapy may be appropriate for managing uveitis, but there is no clear evidence of uveitis in the patient's presentation, and it may not address any underlying systemic issues.

D. Performing diagnostic pars plana vitrectomy may be necessary in some cases of uveitis or retinal detachment, but it is not the most appropriate step in the patient's management at this time, given the absence of clear indications for surgical intervention.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in the patient's management would be to obtain a urinalysis to help identify potential causes of the patient's symptoms and guide further management.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is C. Obtain specular microscopy.

Specula microscopy is a technique used to examine the endothelial cells of the cornea, which can help diagnose various corneal diseases, including herpetic keratitis. In this case, the patient's symptoms of a slightly displaced pupil and mild corectopia, along with the physical examination findings of iridocorneal touch and a "hammered silver" appearance of the involved cornea, suggest the possibility of a corneal infection. Herpetic keratitis is a common cause of corneal infection, and it is important to rule out this diagnosis in order to provide appropriate treatment and prevent further complications.

Option A, starting pilocarpine eyedrops, is not the next step in management. Pilocarpine is a medication used to treat glaucoma by reducing intraocular pressure. While the patient does have a high hyperopic refractive error, there is no indication in the case description of glaucoma or elevated intraocular pressure.

Option B, testing the aqueous fluid for Human herpesvirus 1, may be considered, but it is not the most appropriate next step. While herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a common cause of herpetic keratitis, the presence of HSV in the aqueous fluid does not necessarily confirm the diagnosis, as HSV can also be present in the aqueous fluid of patients without herpetic keratitis. Additionally, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not strongly suggest herpetic keratitis.

Option D, recommending genetic testing, is not relevant to the patient's current symptoms and physical examination findings. Genetic testing may be considered in certain cases of herpetic keratitis, but it is not necessary at this point in the patient's management.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to obtain specular microscopy to evaluate the endothelial cells of the cornea and help diagnose any potential corneal infection.

**Answer**: D. Order catheter cerebral angiography

The correct answer is D. Order catheter cerebral angiography, as it is the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic workup of this patient's condition.

A. Orbital biopsy is not the next best step, as it would not provide information about the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Biopsy may be considered later in the management of the condition, but it is not the most appropriate step at this point.

B. Start systemic corticosteroids may be considered in the management of some orbital inflammatory conditions, but it is not the most appropriate step in this case, as there is no evidence of an inflammatory process.

C. Start systemic antibiotics is not the next best step, as there is no evidence of an infection. Antibiotics may be considered if there is evidence of an infection or if the patient has a history of recent trauma, but they are not indicated based on the information provided.

D. Order catheter cerebral angiography is the most appropriate next step, as it would provide information about the blood vessels in the brain and orbits, which could help in the diagnosis and management of the patient's condition. The patient's symptoms of unilateral proptosis, redness, diplopia, and numbness, along with the physical examination findings of dilated, tortuous blood vessels and a dilated superior ophthalmic vein, suggest a possible vascular abnormality. Angiography would help to confirm this diagnosis and guide further management.

**Answer**:B. Computed tomography scan of the orbits without contrast

The patient's symptoms of decreased vision, tearing, photophobia, and burning in the left eye, along with the physical examination findings of mild corneal edema, shallow anterior chamber, iris heterochromia, and intumescent white cataract with pigment deposition on the anterior lens capsule, suggest a possible diagnosis of traumatic cataract and heterochromia iridis. The acute onset of foreign body sensation in the left eye while splitting wood 1 year prior, along with the absence of any masses, retinal detachment, or foreign body on B-scan ultrasonography, suggest that the cataract may have been caused by a traumatic event.

Observation (choice A) may not be the best course of action at this time, as the patient's symptoms have persisted for 1 year and have worsened over time.

Computed tomography (CT) scan of the orbits without contrast (choice B) is the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation. A CT scan can help to identify any underlying orbital pathology, such as a foreign body or inflammation, that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. The absence of contrast in the CT scan is appropriate, as it is not necessary to evaluate the patient's orbital tissues and structures in this case.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits without contrast (choice C) may also be useful in evaluating the patient's symptoms, but it is not as specific as a CT scan for identifying orbital pathology. MRI may be more appropriate if the patient had symptoms or signs suggestive of a retrobulbar or intracranial process.

Phacoemulsification with intraocular lens placement in the left eye (choice D) may be necessary in the future if the patient's cataract is causing significant visual impairment, but it is not the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation. It is important to first determine the underlying cause of the cataract and to rule out any other potential causes of the patient's symptoms before proceeding with surgery.

**Answer**: D. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy

The patient's symptoms and test results indicate Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, a condition that can happen after a significant physical or emotional shock. It's also known as "broken heart syndrome." The patient had a sudden and unexpected onset of symptoms, including seizures, hypoxia, and cardiogenic shock, which are all indicative of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

The patient's history of end-stage lung disease and recent lung transplantation surgery, which can be a stressful event, supports this diagnosis. The patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) showed nonspecific ST changes and T-wave inversion, which are consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. The patient's echocardiogram also revealed new dilation of the left ventricle with an ejection fraction of 10%, functional mitral regurgitation, and akinesis of the anterior and apical walls, which are all consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

Myocardial infarction (choice A) is unlikely because the patient's ECG did not show any specific changes consistent with myocardial infarction, and the patient's cardiac enzymes were negative. Pulmonary embolism with cardiogenic shock (choice B) is also unlikely because the patient did not have any signs of pulmonary embolism on her imaging studies, and her hypoxia was not consistent with pulmonary embolism. Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema (choice C) is unlikely because the patient's lung transplantation surgery was recent, and it is unlikely that she would have developed noncardiogenic pulmonary edema so soon after surgery.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and test results, the most likely diagnosis is Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

Answer: B. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans

Explanation:

A. Solitary fibrous tumor: This is an incorrect choice because the histopathologic features described in the case, such as the storiform pattern and positive CD34 staining, are not consistent with a solitary fibrous tumor. Solitary fibrous tumors are typically benign tumors that arise from the soft tissue and have a characteristic hemangiopericytic arrangement.

C. Malignant melanoma: This is an incorrect choice because the case does not describe any features consistent with melanoma, such as pigmentation or a history of sun exposure. Additionally, the histopathologic features described, such as the fusiform shape of the tumor cells and the positive CD34 staining, are not typical of melanoma.

D. Spindle cell carcinoma: This is an incorrect choice because the case does not describe any features consistent with spindle cell carcinoma, such as a history of previous radiation exposure or a characteristic "salt and pepper" appearance on histopathology. Spindle cell carcinomas are malignant tumors that arise from the epithelium and have a spindle-shaped morphology.

B. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans: This is the correct choice because it matches the histopathologic features described in the case, such as the storiform pattern and positive CD34 staining. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is a rare soft tissue sarcoma that typically arises in the skin or subcutaneous tissue and has a characteristic "sausage-like" shape. The presence of a translocation t(17;22)(q21;q13) and corresponding COL1A1/PDGFB fusion protein, as demonstrated by FISH, supports the diagnosis.

The correct answer is B: Bilateral malleus fixation.

The patient's symptoms of bilateral conductive hearing loss (CHL) and delayed speech development, along with the absence of any otoscopic abnormalities, suggest a possible middle ear problem. The audiogram shows a moderate low-frequency CHL in the right ear and mild CHL in the left ear, which is consistent with a middle ear conductive hearing loss.

Bilateral malleus fixation is a condition where the malleus bones in both ears become fixed in place, leading to a conductive hearing loss. This condition is rare and can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetic mutations, infections, and trauma. The patient's history of bilateral tympanostomy tubes placement and the absence of any other otologic abnormalities on imaging suggest that bilateral malleus fixation is the most likely diagnosis.

The other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms:

A: Bilateral otosclerosis is a condition where there is abnormal bone growth in the middle ear, leading to a conductive hearing loss. However, this condition typically affects the stapes bone, not the malleus bone, and is usually unilateral.

C: Bilateral tympanosclerosis is a condition where there is thickening and hardening of the tympanic membrane, leading to a conductive hearing loss. However, this condition typically affects the tympanic membrane, not the malleus bone.

D: Bilateral malleoincudal subluxation is a condition where the malleus bone becomes dislocated from the incus bone, leading to a conductive hearing loss. However, this condition is typically caused by trauma or a congenital abnormality and is not associated with bilateral conductive hearing loss.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: Bilateral malleus fixation.

**Answer**:B. Supraglottic paraganglioma

Explanation:

A. Supraglottic hemangioma:
Hemangiomas are benign vascular tumors that can occur in various parts of the body, including the supraglottic region. However, the patient's symptoms of intermittent dysphagia to solid foods, dry cough, foreign-body sensation in the throat, and dyspnea on effort, as well as the highly vascularized appearance of the lesion on narrowband imaging, are not typical of supraglottic hemangioma. Additionally, the patient's age is not consistent with the usual age range for hemangioma, which typically affects children and young adults.

C. Rhabdomyoma of the epiglottis:
Rhabdomyoma is a rare type of benign tumor that originates from the skeletal muscle. It can occur in various parts of the body, including the larynx. However, the patient's symptoms and the appearance of the lesion on endoscopic examination and MRI are not consistent with rhabdomyoma. Rhabdomyoma typically presents with symptoms related to airway obstruction, such as stridor or respiratory distress, and the lesion tends to be larger and more invasive than what is described in the patient's case.

D. Laryngeal squamous papilloma:
Squamous papilloma is a benign tumor that arises from the squamous epithelium of the larynx. It typically presents with symptoms related to airway obstruction, such as hoarseness, stridor, or respiratory distress. The patient's symptoms of dysphagia and foreign-body sensation in the throat are not typical of laryngeal squamous papilloma. Additionally, the appearance of the lesion on endoscopic examination and MRI is not consistent with squamous papilloma, which tends to be more superficial and less vascularized than what is described in the patient's case.

**Answer**: C. Parathyroid lipoadenoma

The correct answer is C. Parathyroid lipoadenoma because it best matches the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, as well as the histopathological findings described in the case.

A. Hyperplastic parathyroid, choice A, refers to a condition where there is an increase in the number of parathyroid cells, leading to an increase in parathyroid hormone (PTH) production. This can cause hypercalcemia, but it does not explain the presence of fat vacuoles in the parathyroid tissue, which is a hallmark of parathyroid lipoadenoma.

B. Parathyroid lipohyperplasia, choice B, is a condition where there is an increase in the number of parathyroid cells, similar to hyperplastic parathyroid, but with an additional increase in fat cells within the parathyroid gland. This can also cause hypercalcemia, but it does not explain the presence of a well-defined nodule or mass, as described in the case.

D. Parathyroid carcinoma, choice D, is a malignant tumor that arises from the parathyroid gland. It can cause hypercalcemia and may have a similar appearance to parathyroid lipoadenoma on imaging studies, but it is a much more aggressive and rare condition. The presence of a well-defined nodule or mass, as described in the case, is more consistent with a parathyroid adenoma, which is a benign tumor.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and histopathological findings, the most likely diagnosis is C. Parathyroid lipoadenoma.

**Answer**: C. Lymphomatoid papulosis

The correct answer is C. Lymphomatoid papulosis, as it best fits the patient's symptoms and laboratory results described in the case.

A. Adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATLL) is a malignancy that affects the T-cells and can present with skin lesions. However, ATLL typically presents with more widespread skin involvement, lymphadenopathy, and systemic symptoms, which are not mentioned in the case. Additionally, the patient's age and lack of medical history make ATLL less likely.

B. Primary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (PCALCL) is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that presents with skin lesions. However, PCALCL typically presents with larger, more ulcerated lesions, and the patient's history of waxing and waning lesions over a 2-year period is not consistent with PCALCL.

D. Transformed mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome (MF/SS) are types of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that can present with skin lesions. However, MF/SS typically presents with more widespread skin involvement, lymphadenopathy, and systemic symptoms, which are not mentioned in the case. Additionally, the patient's age and lack of medical history make MF/SS less likely.

C. Lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) is a rare, benign condition that presents with recurrent, self-healing papulonodular lesions on the skin. LyP is often associated with a T-cell lymphocytic infiltrate, which is consistent with the patient's biopsy results showing V-shaped perifascicular infiltrative large lymphocytes. The patient's history of waxing and waning lesions over a 2-year period, as well as the absence of systemic symptoms, are also consistent with LyP. Therefore, C. Lymphomatoid papulosis is the most appropriate diagnosis for this patient.

**Answer**: D. The patient has subclinical hypothyroidism and should have the TSH level repeated in 1 to 3 months.

The correct answer is D because the patient's TSH level is slightly elevated at 4.5 mIU/L, indicating subclinical hypothyroidism. This is supported by the patient's symptoms of hair thinning, itchy scalp, and cold sensitivity, which are consistent with hypothyroidism. The patient's lack of fatigue, depression, memory problems, dry skin, and constipation also suggest that the hypothyroidism is mild or subclinical.

Repeating the TSH level in 1 to 3 months is appropriate because subclinical hypothyroidism can progress to overt hypothyroidism over time, and monitoring the TSH level can help assess the progression of the disease. Additionally, the patient's hyperlipidemia and use of fish oil and red yeast rice extract may also impact thyroid function, and monitoring the TSH level can help assess any changes in thyroid function over time.

Choice A, "The patient has overt hypothyroidism," is incorrect because the patient's TSH level is not elevated enough to indicate overt hypothyroidism. While the patient does have some symptoms consistent with hypothyroidism, the mild elevation of the TSH level suggests that the patient has subclinical hypothyroidism rather than overt hypothyroidism.

Choice B, "The patient has subclinical hyperthyroidism and does not need a repeat testing of a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level," is incorrect because the patient's TSH level is elevated, indicating hypothyroidism rather than hyperthyroidism. Additionally, the patient's symptoms are not consistent with hyperthyroidism.

Choice C, "The patient has subclinical hypothyroidism and does not need a repeat testing of a TSH level," is incorrect because, as mentioned earlier, subclinical hypothyroidism can progress to overt hypothyroidism over time, and monitoring the TSH level can help assess the progression of the disease. Therefore, repeating the TSH level in 1 to 3 months is appropriate to

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is C. Start parenteral thiamine.

Thiamine, also known as vitamin B1, is an essential nutrient that plays a crucial role in the nervous system. Thiamine deficiency can cause a range of neurological symptoms, including nystagmus, ataxia, and cognitive impairment. Wernicke's encephalopathy is a severe form of thiamine deficiency that can result in confusion, memory loss, and ocular abnormalities, including nystagmus.

In this case, the patient's symptoms of nystagmus, hyperalgesia, and cognitive impairment suggest a possible thiamine deficiency. The patient's history of severe Crohn disease and recent surgery increase the likelihood of a nutritional deficiency. Moreover, the patient's postoperative enterocutaneous fistula and prolonged hospital stay further support the possibility of thiamine deficiency.

Administering parenteral thiamine is the appropriate next step in managing this patient's condition. Thiamine supplementation can help to reverse the neurological symptoms and prevent further progression of the deficiency.

Now, let's discuss why the other answer choices are incorrect.

A. Start intravenous acyclovir: Acyclovir is an antiviral medication used to treat herpes simplex virus infections. There is no indication of a viral infection in this patient's case, and acyclovir would not address the underlying cause of the patient's neurological symptoms.

B. Start intravenous thrombolysis: Thrombolysis is the use of medications to dissolve blood clots. There is no indication of a clot or stroke in this patient's case, and thrombolysis would not be appropriate.

D. Start systemic corticosteroids: Corticosteroids are used to reduce inflammation and modulate the immune system. While corticosteroids may be considered in certain neurological conditions, such as multiple sclerosis or myasthenia gravis, they are not the appropriate choice

**Answer**: C. Tumors of the follicular infundibulum

The correct answer is C. Tumors of the follicular infundibulum because the patient's symptoms and the results of the skin biopsy are consistent with this diagnosis.

The patient's symptoms of multiple asymptomatic lesions on the face and neck, which are round, hypopigmented macules that are symmetrically distributed in the affected area, are consistent with the characteristic appearance of tumors of the follicular infundibulum. Additionally, the patient's report of no symptoms and the absence of hair growth in the affected area are also consistent with this diagnosis.

The skin biopsy results also support this diagnosis. The hematoxylin-eosin staining shown in figures C and D reveal a characteristic picture of tumors of the follicular infundibulum, with a well-defined nodule composed of basaloid cells and a peripheral rim of squamous cells. The nodule is centered within the infundibulum, which is a characteristic feature of this condition.

In contrast, the other answer choices do not fit the patient's symptoms and biopsy results as well.

A. Guttata hypomelanosis is a condition characterized by small, round, hypopigmented macules on the skin, but it typically does not involve the face and neck, and the macules are usually smaller than those seen in this patient.

B. Vitiligo is a condition characterized by depigmentation of the skin, but it typically involves the entire skin surface, rather than just the face and neck, and there is no evidence of depigmentation in the patient's skin biopsy.

D. Tuberculoid leprosy is a condition characterized by hypopigmented macules on the skin, but it typically involves the entire skin surface, rather than just the face and neck, and there are no other characteristic features of leprosy in the patient's symptoms or biopsy results.

**Answer**: C. Antimelanoma differentiation associated gene 5 clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results point to a diagnosis of clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis, a type of dermatomyositis that lacks the characteristic muscle weakness and elevated muscle enzymes. The patient's symmetric swelling of the metacarpophalangeal joints and interphalangeal joints, preventing fist formation, and the presence of ulcers on the dorsal aspects of the fingers are consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's skin lesions, including ulcerated lichenoid papules on the palmar creases of the interphalangeal joints, are also consistent with dermatomyositis.

The patient's laboratory results also support this diagnosis. The presence of anti-SSA (Ro) antibodies and immunoglobulin G anticardiolipin antibodies, along with the patient's hyperferritinemia and T lymphocytopenia, are consistent with dermatomyositis. The patient's negative results for HIV, anti–Scl-70 antibodies, anti–β2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, cryoglobulins, and anti–Mi-2 antibodies also suggest that this is not a case of systemic lupus erythematosus.

The patient's chest computed tomography (CT) scan, which showed hilar lymphadenopathy, interstitial thickening, and perilymphatic ground glass opacities, may indicate the presence of an underlying lung disease, such as interstitial lung disease, which is a common association with dermatomyositis.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis, which is why choice C is the correct answer.

In contrast, choice A, sarcoidosis and/or lymphoma syndrome, is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results. While the patient

**Answer**: C. Crystal-storing histiocytosis

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results, as well as the biopsy findings, point to crystal-storing histiocytosis as the correct diagnosis. Crystal-storing histiocytosis is a rare condition where histiocytes accumulate and store crystals in the skin, leading to the formation of papules or nodules.

The patient's history of splenic marginal zone lymphoma with bone marrow infiltration and IgM paraproteinemia increases the likelihood of crystal-storing histiocytosis. The elevated white blood cell count and recent rise of C-reactive protein levels also support this diagnosis.

The biopsy findings show an interstitial infiltrate of deeply eosinophilic cells in the entire dermis and adjacent subcutis, which is consistent with crystal-storing histiocytosis. The hematoxylin-eosin staining shows a large number of histiocytes with abundant, deeply eosinophilic cytoplasm, which is characteristic of crystal-storing histiocytosis.

Wells syndrome, cutaneous amyloidosis, and erysipelas are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results. Wells syndrome is a rare condition characterized by the rapid growth of a solitary or multiple painless nodules on the skin, usually on the extremities. Cutaneous amyloidosis is a condition where abnormal proteins accumulate in the skin, leading to the formation of papules, nodules, or plaques. Erysipelas is a bacterial infection of the skin that causes redness, swelling, and warmth.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and biopsy findings, the most likely diagnosis is crystal-storing histiocytosis.

**Answer**:B. Urea cycle disorder

The patient's presentation of recurrent coma, refractory status epilepticus, and hyperammonemia suggests a metabolic disorder. Urea cycle disorder is the most likely diagnosis due to the following reasons:

1. Elevated ammonia levels: The patient's ammonia levels were consistently elevated, ranging from 233 µg/dL to 1960 µg/dL, which is a hallmark of urea cycle disorder. This disorder is characterized by a deficiency in one of the enzymes involved in the urea cycle, leading to an accumulation of ammonia in the blood.
2. Refractory status epilepticus: The patient's seizures were refractory to treatment with multiple medications, which is consistent with the severe neurological symptoms seen in urea cycle disorder.
3. Lack of other explanatory causes: The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory results do not suggest other possible causes of his symptoms, such as Reye syndrome (choice A), fatty acid oxidation disorder (choice C), or organic acidemia (choice D).
4. Response to treatment: The patient's condition improved with sodium phenylbutyrate, a medication used to treat urea cycle disorder, supporting the diagnosis.

In contrast, Reye syndrome (choice A) is a rare condition that occurs in children and is associated with aspirin use during viral infections. Fatty acid oxidation disorder (choice C) is a group of metabolic disorders that affect the breakdown of fatty acids, but do not typically present with hyperammonemia or refractory seizures. Organic acidemia (choice D) refers to a group of metabolic disorders that result in the accumulation of organic acids, but do not typically present with the same constellation of symptoms as urea cycle disorder.

**Answer**:B. Epstein-Barr virus infection

The correct answer is B. Epstein-Barr virus infection, as it is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

A. Streptococcal pharyngitis is an unlikely diagnosis, as the patient had a negative rapid antigen detection test for group A Streptococcus, and the symptoms of sore throat and fever do not necessarily indicate this diagnosis. Additionally, the presence of conjunctival hemorrhage and ecchymoses suggests a different etiology.

C. Neuroblastoma is an unlikely diagnosis, as it is a rare childhood cancer that typically presents with symptoms such as abdominal pain, mass, or neurological symptoms, none of which are present in this case.

D. Viral hepatitis is an unlikely diagnosis, as the patient's liver function test results are only mildly elevated, and there is no evidence of viral hepatitis on physical examination or laboratory tests.

On the other hand, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection is a common cause of infectious mononucleosis, which presents with symptoms such as fever, sore throat, and lymphadenopathy. The patient's symptoms of fever, sore throat, and bilateral conjunctival hemorrhage, as well as the presence of tonsillar hypertrophy and lymphocytosis on complete blood count, are consistent with EBV infection. Additionally, the positive throat culture for group A Streptococcus suggests a possible co-infection, which can increase the severity of EBV infection. Therefore, B. Epstein-Barr virus infection is the most appropriate answer.

**Answer**:C. Blunt traumatic rupture of the diaphragm

The patient's symptoms of chest discomfort and longstanding dyspnea on exertion, along with the large air-fluid level seen on the chest roentgenogram and the history of a previous motorcycle crash, suggest a possible blunt traumatic rupture of the diaphragm. This is supported by the patient's report of a brief loss of consciousness and the absence of any other significant injuries. The patient's age and history of a previous umbilical hernia repair also increase the likelihood of a blunt traumatic rupture of the diaphragm.

Type IV hiatal hernia (choice A) is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and history. While hiatal hernias can cause dyspnea and chest discomfort, they typically do not result in a large air-fluid level on chest imaging. Additionally, the patient's history of a previous motorcycle crash and brief loss of consciousness suggests a more acute injury.

Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (choice B) is also unlikely given the patient's age and symptoms. Congenital diaphragmatic hernias typically present in infancy or childhood and are rare in adults. Moreover, the patient's history of a previous motorcycle crash and brief loss of consciousness suggests a more acute injury.

Diaphragm eventration (choice D) is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and history. Diaphragm eventration is a rare condition characterized by a paralysis of the diaphragm, which can cause dyspnea and chest discomfort. However, it is not typically associated with a large air-fluid level on chest imaging, and the patient's history of a previous motorcycle crash and brief loss of consciousness suggests a more acute injury.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, history, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is blunt traumatic rupture of the diaphragm (choice C).

**Answer**: D. Intramural hematoma

The patient's symptoms of progressive dyspnea at rest, tachycardia, and tachypnea, along with the physical examination findings of bilateral rales, cold extremities, and regular heartbeat with faint S1 and S2, suggest a cardiovascular condition. The laboratory findings being within normal limits and the absence of pitting edema also support this diagnosis.

The transthoracic echocardiography and computed tomography of the chest further support the diagnosis of intramural hematoma. The hypoechoic mass observed in the apical region of the left ventricle on echocardiography and the hypodense lesion surrounding the anterolateral wall of the left ventricle and apex on computed tomography are consistent with an intramural hematoma.

Intramural hematoma is a rare complication of myocardial infarction that occurs when there is bleeding within the wall of the heart muscle. It can cause symptoms similar to those of cardiac tamponade, such as dyspnea, tachycardia, and tachypnea, and can also lead to cardiac arrest if left untreated.

The other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and findings.

A. Pseudoaneurysm due to free wall rupture: A pseudoaneurysm is a rare complication of myocardial infarction that occurs when there is a rupture of the ventricular free wall, leading to the formation of a false aneurysm. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest a pseudoaneurysm, and the absence of a pulsatile mass on echocardiography makes this diagnosis less likely.

B. Apical aneurysm with thrombus formation: An apical aneurysm is a rare complication of myocardial infarction that occurs when there is a dilatation of the apical region of the left ventricle. The presence of a thrombus within the aneurysm can cause symptoms similar to those of cardiac tamponade. However, the

**Answer**: C. Prescribe oral aciclovir

The correct answer is C. Prescribe oral aciclovir because it is the most appropriate treatment for the patient's condition.

The patient presents with multiple target lesions and erythema on his right eyelids, which suggests a diagnosis of herpes zoster ophthalmicus (HZO). HZO is a viral infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) that affects the eye and its surrounding tissues. It is characterized by the presence of clusters of vesicles or pustules on the eyelids, conjunctiva, and/or cornea.

Oral aciclovir is the treatment of choice for HZO, as it is an antiviral medication that is effective against VZV. It helps to reduce the severity and duration of the symptoms, and also reduces the risk of complications such as postherpetic neuralgia (PHN) and corneal ulceration.

Option A, observe, is not appropriate as the patient has a clear diagnosis of HZO, and observation alone would not be sufficient to manage the condition.

Option B, prescribe oral flucloxacillin, is incorrect because flucloxacillin is an antibiotic that is used to treat bacterial infections, not viral infections.

Option D, prescribe oral cimetidine, is also incorrect because cimetidine is an antacid that is used to treat gastric ulcers, not viral infections.

Explanation:

A. Schedule an electroretinogram: This choice is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a corneal problem, rather than a retinal issue. An electroretinogram (ERG) is a test that measures the electrical activity of the retina and is not indicated in this case.

B. Perform corneal cultures: This choice is incorrect because there is no indication of a corneal infection or ulcer. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a non-infectious condition, and corneal cultures would not be helpful in this case.

C. Start topical steroids and cyclosporine A eyedrops: This choice is correct because punctate keratitis is a common complication of Klinefelter syndrome, and topical steroids and cyclosporine A eyedrops are effective in treating this condition. The use of steroids can help reduce inflammation and promote healing of the corneal epithelium, while cyclosporine A can help reduce the risk of corneal perforation.

D. Observe: This choice is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a treatable condition. Observation alone would not be appropriate, as the patient's symptoms and signs of punctate keratitis could worsen over time, potentially leading to complications such as corneal perforation. It is important to initiate treatment promptly to prevent further damage to the cornea.

**Answer**:C. Perform an immediate lumbar puncture

Explanation:

A. Continue anticoagulation and monitor closely in an outpatient clinical setting: This option does not address the patient's worsening symptoms, including bilateral blurred vision, photophobia, headache, nausea, and fevers, which suggest a possible intracranial complication. It also does not take into account the patient's recent development of mastoiditis, which requires prompt treatment.

B. Continue anticoagulation, prescribe oral antibiotics, and monitor closely in an outpatient clinical setting: This option is inadequate for several reasons. Firstly, the patient's symptoms are worsening, and outpatient management may not be sufficient to address the severity of her condition. Secondly, while antibiotics may be appropriate for mastoiditis, they will not address the underlying intracranial complication that is causing the patient's symptoms. Lastly, close monitoring in an outpatient setting may not be sufficient to detect any further deterioration in the patient's condition.

D. Perform an urgent radical mastoidectomy: This option is not appropriate at this stage. While surgical intervention may be necessary in some cases of mastoiditis, the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a more urgent need for lumbar puncture to address the intracranial complication. Radical mastoidectomy is a more invasive procedure that may not be necessary at this time and may not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

C. Perform an immediate lumbar puncture: This option is the most appropriate choice. The patient's symptoms, including bilateral blurred vision, photophobia, headache, nausea, and fevers, suggest a possible intracranial complication that requires urgent attention. Lumbar puncture can help to confirm the diagnosis of meningitis or encephalitis, which would explain the patient's symptoms and examination findings. Additionally, lumbar puncture can provide valuable information about the patient's cerebrospinal fluid pressure, cell count, and biochemical markers,

**Answer**:B. Order magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography of the brain and cervical spine

The patient's symptoms of left-sided hemibody paresthesia, dysphagia, and ataxia, along with the physical examination findings of mild right-sided ptosis and miosis, are consistent with a diagnosis of Horner syndrome. However, the patient's history of a single episode of binocular diplopia that lasted for 1 day and resolved spontaneously, suggests that there may be an underlying cranial nerve disorder.

Option B, ordering magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the brain and cervical spine, is the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation. MRI and MRA can help to identify any structural abnormalities in the brain and cervical spine that may be causing the patient's symptoms, such as a tumor, stroke, or vasculitis. This information will be important in determining the underlying cause of the Horner syndrome and guiding further management.

Option A, performing a lumbar puncture and measuring opening pressure and cerebrospinal fluid composition, may be necessary later in the patient's evaluation, but it is not the most appropriate next step. A lumbar puncture can help to diagnose conditions such as meningitis or encephalitis, but it is not likely to provide information about the underlying cause of the Horner syndrome.

Option C, performing an apraclonidine test to confirm the diagnosis of Horner syndrome, is not necessary at this time. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are already consistent with a diagnosis of Horner syndrome, and an apraclonidine test is not likely to provide additional useful information.

Option D, ordering tests for erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, and syphilis serologies, may be appropriate later in the patient's evaluation, but it is not the most appropriate next step. These tests can help to diagnose conditions such as inflammatory or infectious disorders, but

**Answer**:C. Initiate steroid pulse therapy for acute giant cell myocarditis

The correct answer is C. Initiate steroid pulse therapy for acute giant cell myocarditis.

The patient's presentation of progressive shortness of breath, ST-segment elevation on electrocardiogram, and elevated troponin-T levels suggests a cardiac condition. The sawtooth pattern of hyperenhancement in the left ventricular epicardium on delayed enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging and extensive myocardial edema on T2-weighted short tau inversion recovery imaging from CMR are consistent with acute myocarditis. The absence of coronary artery disease and the presence of myocardial edema suggest that the myocarditis is not caused by ischemia.

The patient's age and clinical presentation, along with the CMR findings, are consistent with giant cell myocarditis. This is a rare condition that is often associated with a viral infection and can cause severe left ventricular dysfunction.

Steroid pulse therapy is a common treatment for giant cell myocarditis, as it can help reduce inflammation and prevent further myocardial damage. It is important to note that the patient's clinical presentation and CMR findings are consistent with acute myocarditis, and steroid pulse therapy should be initiated promptly to prevent further damage to the myocardium.

Option A, conducting close follow-up and providing medical treatment, may be appropriate for patients with mild or chronic myocarditis, but it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient with acute giant cell myocarditis.

Option B, performing positron emission tomographic/CT imaging to guide steroid treatment, may be useful in some cases of myocarditis, but it is not necessary in this case, as the diagnosis is already established, and the patient's clinical presentation and CMR findings are consistent with acute giant cell myocarditis.

The negative immunostains for S100, pankeratin AE1/AE3, SMSA, and GFAP support the diagnosis of a malignant ossifying fibromyxoid tumor (MOFT), as these markers are typically negative in this entity. The presence of atypical cells with increased mitotic activity in a myxoid stroma also supports the diagnosis of MOFT.

Chondroblastic osteosarcoma (choice A) is unlikely given the absence of a primary bone lesion and the presence of a submucosal growth. Chondrosarcoma (choice B) is also unlikely given the absence of a primary bone lesion and the presence of a heterogeneous ossified lesion. Malignant mixed tumor of salivary gland (choice C) is unlikely given the absence of a salivary gland component in the tumor.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Malignant ossifying fibromyxoid tumor.

**Answer**: A. Lipoma

The correct answer is A. Lipoma because it matches the described characteristics of the mass. According to the given case study, the mass was a large, irregular pedunculated mass on the left anterior false vocal fold. It was also described as having a papillary-like architecture, expansion of the submucosa by benign mature adipose tissue, and variable amount of fibrous tissue. These features are consistent with a lipoma, which is a benign tumor composed of fat cells.

In contrast, the other answer choices do not match the described characteristics of the mass:

B. Vocal cord polyp: A vocal cord polyp is a growth on the vocal cord that can cause hoarseness or other vocal cord symptoms. While it can be pedunculated, it does not have the same papillary-like architecture or expansion of the submucosa by benign mature adipose tissue as described in the case study.

C. Squamous papilloma: A squamous papilloma is a benign growth that occurs on the vocal cords or other areas of the larynx. It is characterized by a papillary or verrucous surface and can cause symptoms such as hoarseness or airway obstruction. However, it does not have the same expansion of the submucosa by benign mature adipose tissue or variable amount of fibrous tissue as described in the case study.

D. Adenoid cystic carcinoma: Adenoid cystic carcinoma is a malignant tumor that can occur in the larynx or other areas of the head and neck. It is characterized by a slow-growing, painless mass that can cause symptoms such as hoarseness or airway obstruction. However, it does not have the same papillary-like architecture or expansion of the submucosa by benign mature adipose tissue as described in the case study.

Therefore, based on the given case study and the described characteristics of the mass, the correct answer is A. Lipoma.

**Answer**:B. Intrasphenoid pseudoaneurysm of the internal carotid artery

The correct answer is B, Intrasphenoid pseudoaneurysm of the internal carotid artery, because it best fits the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.

A, Fungus ball, is an unlikely diagnosis as it typically presents with unilateral nasal congestion, facial pain, and/or headache, and is often associated with a history of sinus surgery or trauma. The patient's symptoms of dizziness and headache to the vertex with left retro-orbital irradiation, as well as the imaging findings of a double-lined appearance of the sinus walls and bony defects of the sphenoid sinus walls, do not support this diagnosis.

C, Cerebrospinal fluid leak with sinusitis, is also an unlikely diagnosis as the patient's symptoms do not suggest a leak, and the imaging findings do not show evidence of sinusitis. The presence of a hyperintense line peripheral layer consistent with fluid retention on T2-weighted images does not necessarily indicate a leak, as it can also be seen in other conditions such as a tumor or an inflammatory process.

D, Hypervascular metastasis from thyroid cancer, is an unlikely diagnosis as the patient does not have a history of thyroid cancer, and the imaging findings do not suggest a metastasis. The intense enhancement of the oval black area in the upper part of the sinus on VIBE sequences after gadolinium administration is more consistent with an intrasphenoid pseudoaneurysm.

In contrast, Intrasphenoid pseudoaneurysm of the internal carotid artery is a possible diagnosis that fits the patient's symptoms and imaging findings. The patient's dizziness and headache to the vertex with left retro-orbital irradiation are consistent with a vascular lesion in the sphenoid sinus. The double-lined appearance of the sinus walls and bony defects of the sphenoid sinus walls next to the cavernous sinus along the floor suggest a possible vascular malformation.

**Answer**:C. Kimura disease

The correct answer is C. Kimura disease because it matches the given case's features, including a slow-growing right facial mass, lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia, and the presence of follicular hyperplasia and a diffuse infiltrate of eosinophils on histopathology. Kimura disease is a rare, benign, and chronic inflammatory condition that affects the lymph nodes and other lymphoid tissues. It is characterized by the proliferation of lymphoid follicles, germinal centers, and blood vessels, leading to the formation of nodules or masses. Eosinophilia is a common feature of Kimura disease, and it can also cause infiltration into surrounding tissues, such as the skin and cartilage.

In contrast, Castleman disease (choice A) is a rare lymphoproliferative disorder that presents with a solitary or multiple masses in the mediastinum, neck, or other parts of the body. It is characterized by a benign proliferation of lymphoid cells, but it can be associated with various systemic symptoms, such as fever, weight loss, and fatigue. Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia (choice B) is a rare, benign condition that affects the skin and subcutaneous tissues. It is characterized by the proliferation of blood vessels and lymphoid cells, leading to the formation of papules, nodules, or plaques. Sclerosing mucoepidermoid carcinoma with eosinophilia (choice D) is a rare type of salivary gland cancer that presents with a slow-growing mass in the parotid gland. It is characterized by the proliferation of malignant epithelial cells that infiltrate the surrounding tissues, leading to the formation of a tumor. While eosinophilia can be present in some cases of sclerosing mucoepidermoid carcinoma, it is not a defining feature of this condition.

Therefore, based on the given case's features, the most appropriate diagnosis is Kimura disease

**Answer**: C. Laryngeal saccular cyst

The correct answer is C. Laryngeal saccular cyst because it matches the symptoms and findings described in the case.

A. Laryngeal carcinoma is incorrect because there is no mention of any suspicious lesions or symptoms that would suggest cancer. The patient's symptoms of hoarseness and foreign body sensation in the throat are more consistent with a benign lesion.

B. Laryngocele is incorrect because it refers to a cystic dilatation of the laryngeal ventricle, which is not what is described in the case. The patient's lesion was located in the right-sided supraglottic submucosal region, and did not involve the laryngeal ventricle.

D. Thyroid cartilage chondroma is incorrect because it refers to a benign growth of cartilage in the thyroid cartilage, which is not related to the patient's symptoms or findings.

The patient's symptoms of hoarseness and foreign body sensation in the throat, along with the physical examination findings of a right-sided supraglottic submucosal mass that obscured visualization of the glottis, are consistent with a diagnosis of a laryngeal saccular cyst. The fact that the lesion was completely removed using a pulsed potassium titanyl phosphate laser and cold instrumentation, and that the patient had significant voice improvement and normal vocal fold movement at 6 weeks, supports this diagnosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Laryngeal saccular cyst.

**Answer**: C. Idelalisib-induced colitis

The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and colonic wall thickening without perforation, as well as the negative results of stool culture and Clostridium difficile toxin assay, suggest that the cause of her symptoms is not an infection. The patient's history of relapsed grade 2 follicular lymphoma and treatment with idelalisib, a drug that targets the B-cell receptor, suggest that the cause of her symptoms is likely related to the medication.

Idelalisib has been associated with gastrointestinal toxicities, including diarrhea, abdominal pain, and colitis, in some cases. The patient's biopsy results, which showed inflammation and ulceration in the colon, are consistent with idelalisib-induced colitis.

Therefore, choice C, Idelalisib-induced colitis, is the correct answer.

Choice A, Cytomegalovirus infection, is unlikely because the patient did not have any symptoms or signs of a viral infection, such as fever, fatigue, or lymphadenopathy.

Choice B, Lymphomatous polyposis, is also unlikely because the patient did not have any symptoms or signs of lymphoma, such as lymphadenopathy, fever, or weight loss.

Choice D, Ischemic colitis, is unlikely because the patient did not have any symptoms or signs of ischemic colitis, such as abdominal pain, fever, or rectal bleeding.

In summary, the patient's symptoms and medical history, as well as the biopsy results, suggest that the cause of her symptoms is idelalisib-induced colitis, making choice C the correct answer.

**Answer**:C. Measure levels of urine and serum porphyrins

The correct answer is C. Measure levels of urine and serum porphyrins, because the patient's symptoms and history suggest a possible diagnosis of porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), a rare genetic disorder that affects the skin and liver. PCT is characterized by the accumulation of porphyrins in the skin, leading to blistering, scarring, and increased skin fragility. The patient's history of heavy alcohol consumption and smoking may have contributed to the development of PCT.

Measuring levels of urine and serum porphyrins can help confirm the diagnosis of PCT. In PCT, the levels of porphyrins in the urine are typically elevated, and the levels of porphyrins in the serum may be normal or mildly elevated. Measuring porphyrin levels can help differentiate PCT from other skin conditions that may have similar symptoms, such as bullous pemphigoid or hand-foot-mouth disease.

The other answer choices are not as relevant to the patient's symptoms and medical history:

A. Check serum bullous pemphigoid antibody titers: Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune disorder that can cause blistering and skin fragility, but it is not associated with porphyrin accumulation. Measuring serum bullous pemphigoid antibody titers would not be helpful in diagnosing PCT.

B. Discontinue lisinopril: Lisinopril is an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor that the patient is taking for hypertension. While ACE inhibitors can cause a rare side effect called angioedema, which can lead to skin swelling and blistering, this is not related to the patient's symptoms or medical history. Discontinuing lisinopril would not be necessary to diagnose or treat PCT.

D. Swab lesions and send for polymerase chain reaction testing for coxsackievirus (ie, hand-foot-mouth disease): Hand-foot-mouth disease is a viral infection that can

**Answer**:C. The patient has microscopic polyangiitis.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), a type of systemic vasculitis that affects small blood vessels. The presence of hemoptysis (coughing up blood), weight loss, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diffuse crackles on lung examination are consistent with lung involvement, which is a common feature of MPA. The patient's history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis also increases the likelihood of a diagnosis of MPA, as the two conditions are known to be associated.

The laboratory results support the diagnosis of MPA, as the patient has a positive antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) test, which is commonly seen in patients with MPA. The patient's creatinine level is also elevated, indicating kidney dysfunction, which is another common feature of MPA. The presence of red blood cells in the urine and the absence of proteinuria suggest a kidney injury, which is consistent with the diagnosis of MPA.

The chest x-ray and computed tomographic imaging findings of bilateral opacities and ground-glass opacities in the left lung, respectively, are also consistent with lung involvement in MPA.

In contrast, choice A, pneumonia with sepsis, is unlikely given the patient's history and laboratory results. Although the patient has a cough with blood-streaked sputum, the absence of fever and the presence of weight loss, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain suggest a chronic process rather than an acute infection. Additionally, the patient's blood cultures are negative, making sepsis less likely.

Choice B, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), is also unlikely given the patient's history and laboratory results. Although SLE can present with lung symptoms and kidney dysfunction, the patient's lack of symptoms such as fever, rashes, oral ulcers, Raynaud phenomenon, chest pain, dyspnea on exertion

**Answer**: B. Follicular psoriasis

The correct answer is B. Follicular psoriasis. Psoriasis is a chronic skin condition characterized by thick, scaly, red, and sometimes itchy patches on the skin. Follicular psoriasis is a type of psoriasis that affects the hair follicles, causing small, scaly papules to form around the hair follicles.

The patient's history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes and insulin-like growth factor 1 deficiency increases the likelihood of developing psoriasis. The patient's symptoms, including mildly pruritic lesions that occur in crops and last a few months before spontaneously resolving without scarring, are consistent with follicular psoriasis. The physical examination findings of multiple small, monomorphic, and somewhat octagonal groupings of folliculocentric, erythematous, scaly, and hyperkeratotic papules at different stages of development distributed across the arms, legs, trunk, and buttocks are also consistent with follicular psoriasis.

The shave biopsy specimen (hematoxylin-eosin) shown in Figure C and D supports the diagnosis of follicular psoriasis, as it reveals a dense infiltrate of lymphocytes, histiocytes, and neutrophils around the hair follicles, which is consistent with psoriasis.

Now, let's discuss why the other answer choices are incorrect:

A. Follicular pityriasis rubra pilaris: Pityriasis rubra pilaris is a chronic skin condition that causes red, scaly patches on the skin, particularly on the scalp, beard, and pubic area. While it may have some similarities with follicular psoriasis, it is a different condition. The patient's history and physical examination findings do not support this diagnosis.

**Answer**:B. Reed syndrome

The correct answer is B. Reed syndrome because it matches the patient's symptoms and medical history. Reed syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple benign tumors, primarily on the skin and subcutaneous tissue. The patient's history of painful nodules on her lower extremities, neck, and jawline, as well as the physical examination findings of scattered skin-colored papules and firm nodules, are consistent with the cutaneous manifestations of Reed syndrome.

Neurofibromatosis type I (A) is a genetic disorder that affects the growth and development of nerve tissue, leading to the formation of benign tumors, called neurofibromas, on or under the skin. While it can cause skin-colored papules and nodules, the distribution and characteristics of the lesions in this case do not fit the typical presentation of neurofibromatosis type I.

Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome (C) is a rare genetic disorder that causes benign skin tumors, lung cysts, and other symptoms. The skin tumors in Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome are typically small, smooth, and flesh-colored, and are usually found on the face, neck, and torso. While the patient's skin-colored papules and nodules could potentially be consistent with Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, the absence of lung cysts and other characteristic symptoms makes this diagnosis less likely.

Tuberous sclerosis (D) is a genetic disorder that causes the growth of non-cancerous tumors in various organs, including the skin, brain, heart, and kidneys. The skin lesions in tuberous sclerosis are typically flat, reddish-brown, and may have a rough texture. While tuberous sclerosis can cause skin nodules, the patient's history and physical examination findings do not suggest this diagnosis.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, the most likely diagnosis is Reed syndrome.

**Answer**: B. Annular elastolytic giant cell granuloma

The correct answer is B, Annular elastolytic giant cell granuloma, because it best matches the clinical and histopathological features described in the case.

A. Granuloma annulare is an uncommon skin condition characterized by the formation of small, annular, dermal granulomas. However, the clinical presentation of granuloma annulare is typically different from the case described. The lesions are usually small, ranging in size from 1-10 mm, and are not necessarily associated with a history of headaches. Moreover, the histopathological features of granuloma annulare are not consistent with the case, as they show a lack of elastophagocytosis and a absence of multinucleated giant cells.

C. Annular lichen planus is a rare variant of lichen planus that presents with annular lesions. However, the clinical and histopathological features of annular lichen planus are not consistent with the case. The lesions of annular lichen planus are typically smaller than the one described, and the histopathological features show a characteristic interface dermatitis with a band-like infiltrate of lymphocytes and a lack of elastophagocytosis.

D. Necrobiosis lipoidica is a rare inflammatory skin condition characterized by the formation of yellowish, flat, or slightly raised plaques with a characteristic "fried egg" appearance. While the clinical presentation of necrobiosis lipoidica may resemble the case, the histopathological features are not consistent. Necrobiosis lipoidica shows a lack of elastophagocytosis and multinucleated giant cells, and the inflammatory infiltrate is predominantly composed of lymphocytes and macrophages.

In contrast, the case described presents with a large, annular plaque with a raised, nodular, and slightly desquamative erythematoviolaceous border and a clear, atrophic center, which is consistent with the clinical presentation of annular elastolytic giant cell granul

**Answer**:D. Langerhans cell histiocytosis

The correct answer is D. Langerhans cell histiocytosis because it is a rare condition that presents with a diffuse rash and spares the palms, soles, and oral mucosa, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms. Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a disorder that affects the immune system and causes an excessive proliferation of Langerhans cells, leading to the formation of papulovesicular, crusted lesions on the skin. The patient's history of being born at full term via spontaneous vaginal delivery after an uncomplicated pregnancy, and the absence of any active rashes on the mother's perineal area, also support this diagnosis.

In contrast, the other answer choices are less likely to be the correct diagnosis for the following reasons:

A. Neonatal varicella syndrome: This is a rare condition that occurs when a fetus is infected with varicella-zoster virus in utero. It is characterized by a diffuse rash, fever, and lethargy. However, the patient's mother was varicella nonimmune, which reduces the likelihood of this diagnosis.

B. Disseminated herpes infection: This is a serious infection that can occur in newborns, but it typically presents with more severe symptoms such as seizures, lethargy, and respiratory distress. The patient's afebrile status and absence of other symptoms make this diagnosis less likely.

C. Congenital syphilis: This is a serious infection that can occur when a fetus is infected with Treponema pallidum in utero. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including a rash, but it typically presents with more severe symptoms such as fever, lethargy, and swollen lymph nodes. The patient's mother's negative syphilis IgG antibody test result and the absence of any other symptoms make this diagnosis less likely.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, the most likely diagnosis is D. Langerhans cell

**Answer**:B. Gallstone ileus

The patient's symptoms of progressive abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, along with the finding of a lost gallstone in the left hemiabdomen on CT scan, are consistent with gallstone ileus. This occurs when a gallstone passes into the small intestine and causes an obstruction. The patient's history of a recent laparoscopic cholecystectomy and the presence of a calcified mass with adjacent inflammatory changes in the left hemiabdomen also support this diagnosis.

Intra-abdominal abscess (A) is unlikely given the patient's recent surgical history and the absence of fever and chills.

Gallstone granuloma (C) is a rare complication of gallstone disease and is characterized by the formation of a granuloma around a gallstone. This diagnosis is unlikely given the patient's recent surgical history and the absence of symptoms consistent with gallstone granuloma.

Eroded gallstone into the abdominal wall (D) is unlikely given the patient's recent surgical history and the absence of signs of peritonitis or abdominal wall erosion.

**Answer**: C. Pancreatic pseudocyst

The patient's symptoms and test results suggest a pancreatic pseudocyst. A pancreatic pseudocyst is a collection of fluid that forms in the pancreas and is surrounded by a well-defined wall. This is consistent with the patient's CT scan, which shows a homogeneous collection of fluid encysted by a well-defined enhancing wall.

The patient's history of acute pancreatitis and prolonged alcohol abuse also support this diagnosis. Acute pancreatitis is a common cause of pancreatic pseudocysts, and alcohol abuse can damage the pancreas and increase the risk of pancreatitis.

The other answer choices are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and test results.

A. Mesenteric cyst: A mesenteric cyst is a rare type of cyst that forms in the mesentery, the tissue that attaches the intestine to the abdominal wall. The patient's CT scan does not show a cyst in the mesentery, and the patient's symptoms do not suggest a mesenteric cyst.

B. Gastric duplication cyst: A gastric duplication cyst is a rare type of cyst that forms in the stomach. The patient's symptoms and CT scan do not suggest a gastric duplication cyst.

D. Walled-off pancreatic necrosis: Walled-off pancreatic necrosis is a complication of acute pancreatitis in which the pancreatic tissue dies and forms a wall around the dead tissue. This can cause a mass to form in the abdomen, but it is not consistent with the patient's CT scan, which shows a homogeneous collection of fluid encysted by a well-defined enhancing wall.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Pancreatic pseudocyst.

**Answer**: C. Use a neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser to release the implant

The correct answer is C because the neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser can be used to cut the implant and release it from the vitreous cavity, allowing it to move away from the visual axis and resolve the patient's symptoms. This approach is less invasive than performing a pars plana vitrectomy, which would require a larger incision and potentially increase the risk of complications.

Option A, continuing to observe and hope the implant settles down or moves away from the visual axis, is not a viable solution as the patient's symptoms are already affecting their daily life, and the implant has not moved away from the visual axis despite observation over a 2-week period.

Option B, injecting an intravitreous gas bubble, may not be effective in displacing the implant, especially if it is located in a more posterior position within the vitreous cavity. Additionally, gas bubbles can cause a temporary increase in intraocular pressure, which may worsen the patient's symptoms.

Option D, performing a pars plana vitrectomy to displace or remove the implant, is a more invasive approach that may be considered if the implant does not respond to laser treatment. However, this approach carries a higher risk of complications, such as retinal detachment, cataract formation, and glaucoma, and may not be necessary if the implant can be successfully released with laser treatment.

Therefore, option C, using a neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser to release the implant, is the most appropriate answer.

**Answer**:B. Schedule the patient for lensectomies with anterior vitrectomy and intraocular lens placement

Explanation:

A. Pharmacologically redilate the pupils and position the patient supinely: This choice is incorrect because the patient's blurry vision is caused by dislocated crystalline lenses, which cannot be treated with pupil dilation or positioning the patient supinely.

C. Refer the patient for connective tissue disease workup: This choice is incorrect because there is no indication of connective tissue disease in the patient's history or examination findings.

D. Observe and reevaluate the patient in 2 months: This choice is incorrect because the patient's blurry vision is persistent and significant, and it requires prompt surgical intervention rather than observation.

B. Schedule the patient for lensectomies with anterior vitrectomy and intraocular lens placement: This choice is correct because it addresses the underlying cause of the patient's blurry vision, which is the dislocation of the crystalline lenses. Lensectomy with anterior vitrectomy and intraocular lens placement is a surgical procedure that can effectively treat dislocated lenses and improve the patient's vision.

**Answer**:B. Examine under anesthesia with peripheral photographs, fluorescein angiography, and laser

The correct answer is B because it is the most appropriate step to evaluate the retinal lesion and determine the appropriate treatment.

A. Obtain a magnetic resonance image of the brain and orbits and treat with chemotherapy:
This choice is incorrect because while an MRI may be necessary to evaluate the extent of the lesion and any potential intracranial involvement, it is not the most urgent step in the management of this patient's condition. The patient's symptoms of decreased vision and leukocoria suggest a potentially sight-threatening condition, and prompt ophthalmological evaluation is necessary to determine the appropriate treatment.

C. Inject an intravitreous anti–vascular endothelial growth factor medication:
This choice is incorrect because while anti-VEGF medication may be a potential treatment option for certain types of retinal lesions, it is not the most appropriate step in the management of this patient's condition. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a potentially more aggressive lesion, and further evaluation is necessary to determine the appropriate treatment.

D. Perform genetic testing:
This choice is incorrect because while genetic testing may be necessary to determine the underlying cause of the patient's condition, it is not the most urgent step in the management of this patient's condition. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a potentially sight-threatening condition, and prompt ophthalmological evaluation is necessary to determine the appropriate treatment.

**Answer**:B. Obtain high-frequency ultrasound biomicroscopy

The correct answer is B, Obtain high-frequency ultrasound biomicroscopy, because it is the most appropriate step to evaluate the iris lesion further. High-frequency ultrasound biomicroscopy (HF-UBM) is a non-invasive imaging technique that provides high-resolution cross-sectional images of the anterior segment and can help to diagnose and characterize various types of ocular tumors, including iris melanomas. In this case, HF-UBM can help to determine the size, shape, and location of the lesion, as well as its relationship to the surrounding tissues, which can aid in the differential diagnosis and guide further management.

Option A, Observe at yearly intervals, is not the most appropriate choice because the lesion has already been observed over several years, and the patient's symptoms have not changed. Moreover, the lesion's size and location suggest that it may be a tumor that requires further evaluation and treatment.

Option C, Perform transcorneal biopsy of the lesion, is not the best choice because it is an invasive procedure that carries risks, such as bleeding, infection, and damage to the eye. Moreover, the lesion's location and size make it difficult to access safely, and there is no clear indication for biopsy at this point.

Option D, Completely excise the lesion with pathological analysis, is not the most appropriate choice because it is a surgical procedure that should only be considered after a definitive diagnosis has been made. Moreover, excision of the lesion may not be necessary if the lesion is benign, and it may not be possible to completely remove the lesion if it is large or has spread to surrounding tissues.

Therefore, B, Obtain high-frequency ultrasound biomicroscopy, is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's iris lesion.

The correct answer is D. Perform ECG with right precordial leads.

Let's go through each choice and explain why it's incorrect or correct:

A. Perform bedside echocardiography:
Bedside echocardiography can provide valuable information about cardiac function and can help diagnose various cardiac conditions. However, in this case, it's not the most appropriate next step. The patient has already had a coronary angiogram that showed complete occlusion of the mid-right coronary artery, and the ECG shows resolution of the ST-segment elevations in the inferior leads with a new rSR′ pattern. Performing bedside echocardiography may not provide any new information that would change management.

B. Perform another coronary angiography:
Repeat coronary angiography may be considered in some cases, such as when there is a question about the completeness of the occlusion or the presence of other lesions. However, in this case, the initial coronary angiogram showed complete occlusion of the mid-right coronary artery, and the ECG changes suggest that the occlusion has been successfully treated with PCI. Repeat coronary angiography may not provide any additional information and may expose the patient to unnecessary risk.

C. Perform ECG using posterior leads:
Posterior leads (V7-V9) can provide information about the posterior wall of the heart, which may be useful in certain cases. However, in this case, the ECG changes suggest that the occlusion is located in the inferior wall of the heart, and posterior leads may not provide any new information.

D. Perform ECG with right precordial leads:
Right precordial leads (V4-V6) can provide information about the right ventricle and the lateral wall of the heart. In this case, the ECG changes suggest that there may be ongoing ischemia in the lateral wall, which could be confirmed by right precordial leads. Performing ECG with right precordial leads may help guide management decisions, such as whether to perform further interventions or optimize medications to reduce ischemia.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Perform ECG with right precordial leads.

A teratoma is a type of benign tumor that originates from pluripotent cells, which are cells that have the ability to differentiate into any cell type in the body. Teratomas can contain a variety of tissue types, including derivatives of all three embryonic germ layers (ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm). The mass in this case is consistent with a teratoma, as it contains multiple tissue types, including solid and cystic components, and has a multinodular appearance. The presence of calcifications within the mass also supports this diagnosis.

Lymphatic malformations (choice A) are abnormalities of the lymphatic system that can cause fluid accumulation and enlargement of the affected tissue. While lymphatic malformations can also cause neck masses, they typically do not have the same multicystic and solid components as a teratoma.

Venous malformations (choice C) are abnormalities of the venous system that can cause enlargement of the affected tissue. However, venous malformations do not typically have the same multicystic and solid components as a teratoma, and are not usually associated with calcifications.

Dermoid cysts (choice D) are benign growths that originate from ectodermal cells and typically contain skin, hair follicles, and sweat glands. While dermoid cysts can occur in the neck, they are typically smaller and do not have the same multicystic and solid components as a teratoma.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and the results of the MRI and CT scans, the most likely diagnosis is a teratoma.

**Answer**:B. Keratocystic odontogenic tumor

The patient's history of a slowly growing mass in the left jaw, along with the imaging findings of a well-defined hypodense mass within the left masticator space, remodeling of the left mandibular ramus, and absence of overlying skin or mucosal changes, are all consistent with a diagnosis of keratocystic odontogenic tumor (KCOT). KCOTs are benign odontogenic tumors that are known to occur in the jaw bones and are characterized by a squamous lined cyst with parakeratosis, as demonstrated by the pathologic assessment in this case.

Lymphangioma (choice A) is an incorrect diagnosis as it is a benign tumor of lymphatic vessels and typically presents as a soft tissue mass in the neck or thorax, rather than a jaw mass.

Cystic ameloblastoma (choice C) is also an incorrect diagnosis as it is a rare odontogenic tumor that typically presents as a painless, slow-growing mass in the mandible or maxilla, and is characterized by a multilocular radiolucent appearance on imaging, which is not consistent with the imaging findings in this case.

Cystic schwannoma (choice D) is an incorrect diagnosis as it is a rare benign tumor of the peripheral nervous system, typically presenting as a slowly growing mass in the soft tissues of the head and neck, and is not associated with the jaw bones or odontogenic tissues.

Therefore, based on the patient's history, imaging findings, and pathologic assessment, the most likely diagnosis is keratocystic odontogenic tumor (KCOT), which is choice B.

**Answer**: B. Metastatic renal cell carcinoma

The correct answer is B. Metastatic renal cell carcinoma because the patient's history of stage IV clear cell renal cell carcinoma with metastasis to the ipsilateral adrenal gland, as well as the presence of a soft-tissue mass with involvement of multiple craniofacial bones, is consistent with metastatic disease. The patient's symptoms of frontal headaches and forehead nodules, as well as the physical examination findings of soft, tender nodules at the forehead and right orbit with right proptosis, are also consistent with metastatic disease.

The histopathologic images shown in Figure C and D are consistent with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, with loose billowing clusters of epithelial cells involved by strands of magenta extracellular tissue and cells with abundant clear cytoplasm and nuclei with varying nucleolar prominence. The positive immunohistochemical stains for pancytokeratin, vimentin, CD10, and PAX-8 also support this diagnosis.

In contrast, locally aggressive fibrous dysplasia (choice A) is a benign condition that would not explain the patient's symptoms or physical examination findings. Osteosarcoma (choice C) is a malignant bone tumor that could potentially explain the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, but would not be consistent with the patient's history of renal cell carcinoma. Metastatic breast adenocarcinoma (choice D) is also a possibility, but would not be consistent with the patient's history of renal cell carcinoma.

Therefore, based on the patient's history, symptoms, physical examination findings, and histopathologic images, the most likely diagnosis is metastatic renal cell carcinoma.

The correct answer is C: Eccrine syringofibroadenoma and squamous cell carcinoma.

Eccrine syringofibroadenoma is a rare type of skin cancer that originates in the eccrine glands, which are responsible for producing sweat. It typically presents as a small, flesh-colored or pink papule on the scalp, face, or neck, and can be mistaken for a benign lesion such as a sebaceous hyperplasia or a keratosis. However, eccrine syringofibroadenoma can be aggressive and infiltrate surrounding tissue, making it a potentially more dangerous cancer than basal cell carcinoma.

Squamous cell carcinoma, on the other hand, is a more common type of skin cancer that originates in the squamous cells, which make up the outermost layer of the skin. It can present as a firm, flat, or raised bump on the skin, and can be pink, red, or scaly. Squamous cell carcinoma can be more aggressive than basal cell carcinoma and can spread to other parts of the body if left untreated.

In this case, the patient presented with a 2.5 × 2-cm, singular, umbilicated, ulcerated papular lesion on the left temple, which is consistent with eccrine syringofibroadenoma. The presence of overlying crusts and surrounding erythema and induration suggests that the lesion has been present for some time and has been slowly growing. The patient's history of emphysema and lack of previous skin cancers or surgery also support this diagnosis.

The low-power histological analysis revealed an epidermal proliferative process, with vertically oriented anastomosing strands of basaloid epithelium arising from multiple points along the epidermis, which is consistent with eccrine syringofibroadenoma. The presence of ductal differentiation on high power and the intervening fibrovascular stroma also support this diagnosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: Eccrine syr

**Answer**: D. Epithelioid sarcoma

The patient's symptoms, such as a nonhealing submental ulcer that formed where a laceration caused by an assault had recently closed, and the fact that the ulcer bled, expressed serosanguineous drainage, and was prone to crust formation, suggest a possible diagnosis of epithelioid sarcoma. This is supported by the histopathologic images shown in the question, which reveal a lesion with an infiltrative growth pattern, composed of epithelioid or spindle-shaped tumor cells with atypical vesicular nuclei and pale eosinophilic cytoplasm, and areas of necrosis. Additionally, the tumor cells stained strongly positive for EMA, CD34, and pankeratin, and demonstrated loss of INI-1 immunostaining, which are all consistent with the diagnosis of epithelioid sarcoma.

In contrast, ulcerated squamous cell carcinoma (choice A) would not explain the patient's history of a nonhealing ulcer, and the histopathologic images do not show the characteristic features of squamous cell carcinoma. Histiocytoma (choice B) is a benign tumor that does not have the same malignant features as epithelioid sarcoma. Nodular fasciitis (choice C) is a benign condition that does not have the same ulcerative and necrotic features as epithelioid sarcoma.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and the histopathologic images, the correct diagnosis is epithelioid sarcoma, which is choice D.

**Answer**:B. Evaluate for primary adrenal insufficiency with a 250-μg corticotropin stimulation test.

The correct answer is B because the patient's symptoms of chronic fatigue and weight loss, along with the physical examination findings of darkening of the palmar creases and buccal mucosa, are consistent with primary adrenal insufficiency. The patient's history of hypothyroidism also increases the likelihood of primary adrenal insufficiency. A corticotropin stimulation test is the most appropriate diagnostic test to confirm the diagnosis.

A is incorrect because congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a genetic disorder that affects the production of cortisol and aldosterone, and is not typically associated with hypothyroidism or the patient's symptoms.

C is incorrect because a pituitary adenoma is a tumor that can cause hyperpituitarism, but it is not typically associated with primary adrenal insufficiency.

D is incorrect because repeating tests for serum adrenocorticotropic hormone and cortisol may help to confirm a diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency, but it is not the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation.

**Answer**: B. Erythropoietic protoporphyria

Erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the production of heme, a critical molecule in the synthesis of hemoglobin, which carries oxygen in red blood cells. The defect in heme production leads to a buildup of toxic intermediates in the bone marrow, liver, and other organs, causing damage and inflammation. The symptoms of EPP are triggered by exposure to sunlight, which activates the toxic intermediates and leads to the release of chemical mediators that cause pain, swelling, and skin eruptions.

The patient's history of recurrent skin eruptions with sun exposure over the past two years, along with the absence of similar symptoms in other family members, suggests that EPP is the most likely diagnosis. The physical examination findings of acral edema and well-demarcated, tender petechial patches on the dorsal surface of the hands and feet are consistent with EPP. The punch biopsy specimen from the affected area of the hand showed subtle thickening of vessel walls, extravasation of erythrocytes, and fibrin thrombus formation, which are all consistent with the pathologic changes seen in EPP.

Hereditary angioedema (HAE), option A, is a genetic disorder that affects the production of C1 inhibitor, a protein that regulates the complement system. HAE is characterized by recurrent episodes of angioedema, which can affect the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and internal organs. While HAE can present with skin eruptions, the absence of a family history and the patient's history of sun exposure before the onset of symptoms make EPP a more likely diagnosis.

Urticarial vasculitis, option C, is a condition characterized by inflammation of the blood vessels, leading to the formation of urticarial lesions. While urticarial vasculitis can cause skin eruptions, the patient's history of sun exposure and the absence of systemic symptoms such as fever, fatigue, and weight

**Answer**: C. Multiple mucosal neuromas in MEN 2B (multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2b)

The correct answer is C, Multiple mucosal neuromas in MEN 2B, because the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with this diagnosis.

MEN 2B is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of the nervous system and endocrine system. It is characterized by the presence of multiple neuromas, which are benign tumors that grow on nerves. In this case, the patient has multiple small nodules located on the anterior and lateral surface of the tongue, which are consistent with mucosal neuromas.

The patient's marfanoid habitus, disproportion of limbs, and enlarged face are also consistent with MEN 2B, as it is known to cause growth abnormalities. Additionally, the patient's history of no relevant family history supports this diagnosis, as MEN 2B is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern.

The histopathological findings from the biopsy of one of the nodules located on the tongue, shown in Figure C and D, also support this diagnosis. The presence of a neuroma in the tongue is consistent with MEN 2B, as it is known to cause mucosal neuromas in various parts of the body, including the tongue.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of the nervous system and causes facial and oral abnormalities. However, it is not associated with mucosal neuromas or growth abnormalities, making it an unlikely diagnosis for this patient.

B. Crohn disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that can cause oral lesions. However, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest inflammatory bowel disease, and the presence of mucosal neuromas is not typical of Crohn disease.

D. Lipoid proteinosis is a rare genetic disorder that affects the growth

**Answer**: B. Disseminated tinea (Trichophyton rubrum) infection

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of disseminated tinea (Trichophyton rubrum) infection. Tinea is a common fungal infection of the skin caused by the dermatophyte Trichophyton rubrum. In this case, the patient has a history of end-stage liver disease secondary to alcoholic cirrhosis, which can increase the risk of developing fungal infections.

The patient's skin lesions, which are described as purple papules with central black and hemorrhagic crusting, are consistent with the characteristic morphology of tinea. The lesions are also noted to be mildly pruritic, which is a common symptom of tinea. The distribution of the lesions on the face, thighs, and anterior thighs is also consistent with tinea, as the fungus can spread from the scalp to other areas of the body.

The patient's history of recent onset of a skin rash, the morphology of the lesions, and the absence of other conditions that may cause similar lesions, such as Kaposi sarcoma, bacillary angiomatosis, or leukemia cutis, support the diagnosis of disseminated tinea (Trichophyton rubrum) infection.

In contrast, Kaposi sarcoma is a malignancy caused by human herpesvirus 8 and is characterized by the development of multiple, painless, violaceous nodules on the skin and mucous membranes. While Kaposi sarcoma can affect the skin, it typically does not have the same morphology as tinea and is not associated with a history of liver disease.

Bacillary angiomatosis is a bacterial infection caused by Bartonella henselae and is characterized by the development of reddish-brown papules or nodules on the skin. While bacillary angiomatosis can affect the skin, it typically does not have the same morphology as tinea and is not associated with a history of liver

**Answer**:B. Nocardial brain abscess

The patient's symptoms of new-onset slurred speech and left-sided facial droop, along with the physical examination findings of decreased left upper extremity strength, dysphagia, marked left facial droop, and difficulty with multistep commands, are consistent with a stroke or brain infarct. The MRI of the brain demonstrating an intra-axial necrotic lesion with adjacent vasculogenic edema primarily involving the right posterior frontal and anterior parietal lobes supports this diagnosis.

The patient's history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease increases the likelihood of a cardiovascular etiology for the stroke. The absence of an embolic source on echocardiogram and the presence of a remote smoking history suggest that the stroke may be due to a cardio-embolic mechanism.

Nocardial brain abscess is a rare infection that can cause stroke-like symptoms, but it is not the most likely diagnosis given the patient's history and physical examination findings. Metastatic carcinoma and mixed bacterial abscess are also unlikely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and MRI findings. Hemorrhagic brain infarct is a possible diagnosis, but it is less likely than a cardio-embolic stroke given the patient's history and physical examination findings. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Nocardial brain abscess.

**Answer**: D. Obturator hernia

The correct diagnosis is D. Obturator hernia because it aligns with the patient's symptoms and laboratory results. An obturator hernia occurs when a portion of the intestine or other tissue protrudes through the obturator canal, which is a passage in the pelvic bone. This type of hernia can cause abdominal pain, distension, and nausea, which are all present in this patient's case. The patient's history of similar symptoms that were self-relieved suggests that this may be a reducible hernia.

The patient's laboratory results also support this diagnosis. The white blood cell count is elevated, which is consistent with an inflammatory response caused by the hernia. The sodium level is normal, which suggests that the patient is not experiencing excessive fluid loss, which could be a sign of a strangulated hernia. The creatinine level is also normal, which suggests that the patient's kidney function is not compromised.

The abdominal radiography showing segmental dilatation of the small bowel further supports the diagnosis of an obturator hernia, as this is a common finding in patients with this condition. The patient's lack of improvement with observation and the presence of a mass lesion in the right lower pelvic wall on computed tomography also suggest that the patient has an obturator hernia that may be irreducible.

The other answer choices do not align with the patient's symptoms and laboratory results. Acute lymphadenitis (choice A) is an infection of the lymph nodes and would not cause abdominal distension or pain. Inguinal hernia (choice B) occurs when a portion of the intestine protrudes through a weakened area in the abdominal wall, typically in the groin area. Femoral hernia (choice C) is similar to an inguinal hernia but occurs lower in the abdomen. Neither of these hernias would cause symptoms in the right lower pelvic wall, as in this patient's case.

**Answer**: (D) Retroperitoneal liposarcoma

The correct answer is (D) Retroperitoneal liposarcoma because it best fits the patient's symptoms and the findings on the computed tomography (CT) scan.

A retroperitoneal liposarcoma is a type of cancer that develops in the fat cells located in the retroperitoneum, which is the area behind the abdominal cavity. This type of cancer is rare, but it can cause symptoms similar to those described in the case, such as generalized weakness, bilateral lower extremity swelling, and an enlarged abdomen.

The CT scan findings also support this diagnosis. The image shows a large, well-circumscribed mass that displaces the descending colon and envelops the left kidney. This is consistent with a retroperitoneal liposarcoma, which can grow large enough to displace nearby organs and cause compression or displacement of the kidneys.

In contrast, the other answer choices do not fit the patient's symptoms and CT scan findings as well.

(A) Retroperitoneal fibrosis (Ormond disease) is a condition where scar tissue forms in the retroperitoneum, which can cause compression or displacement of nearby organs. However, this condition typically does not cause bilateral lower extremity swelling or an enlarged abdomen, and the CT scan findings would not show a well-circumscribed mass.

(B) Renal cell carcinoma is a type of kidney cancer that can cause symptoms such as flank pain, hematuria, and a palpable mass in the abdomen or flank. However, this patient's symptoms do not suggest kidney cancer, and the CT scan findings do not show any evidence of a kidney mass.

**Answer**:A. Increase topical steroids

The patient's symptoms of decreased visual acuity, elevated intraocular pressure, and anterior chamber inflammation, along with the presence of extensive strands and veils in the vitreous cavity, suggest a possible diagnosis of uveitis. Uveitis is a condition characterized by inflammation in the uveal tract, which can cause damage to the retina and optic nerve, leading to vision loss.

Topical steroids are the first line of treatment for uveitis, as they can help reduce inflammation and prevent further damage to the eye. Increasing the dose of topical steroids, as suggested in option A, is a reasonable next step in management.

Option B, injecting intravitreal antibiotics, may be necessary if there is a bacterial infection present, but it is not the most appropriate step at this time. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest uveitis, rather than a bacterial infection.

Option C, performing vitrectomy, is a surgical procedure that may be necessary in some cases of uveitis, but it is not the most appropriate step at this time. The patient's symptoms and examination findings do not suggest the need for surgical intervention.

Option D, injecting an antifungal drug, is not appropriate in this case, as there is no evidence of a fungal infection.

Therefore, the correct answer is A, increase topical steroids.

The correct answer is C. Neuropsychological testing.

The patient's symptoms of a left homonymous visual field defect, difficulty with reading, and easily getting lost when driving, suggest a possible cognitive impairment. The patient's MRI scan did not show any evidence of a neoplasm or stroke, which suggests that the cause of her symptoms may be related to cognitive decline rather than a structural brain abnormality. Neuropsychological testing would be appropriate to assess the patient's cognitive function and identify any areas of impairment, such as memory, attention, or visual processing.

Repeat MRI (B) may not provide any additional information that would help diagnose the patient's condition, as the previous MRI scans did not show any abnormalities. Lumbar puncture (A) is not necessary at this point, as there is no evidence of a neurological disorder that would require a lumbar puncture. Fluorescein angiography (D) is a test that is used to evaluate the blood vessels in the retina, and would not be helpful in diagnosing the patient's cognitive symptoms.

Therefore, the best next step would be to perform neuropsychological testing to assess the patient's cognitive function and identify any areas of impairment that may be contributing to her symptoms.

**Answer**: D. Recommend a surgical intervention that will return his eyes to their original color

Explanation:

A. Observe: This choice is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest elevated intraocular pressure and endothelial cell loss, which require prompt intervention to prevent further damage. Simply observing the patient without taking any action would not address the underlying issues.

B. Adjust topical medications to decrease intraocular pressure and perform visual field testing: This choice is incorrect because while adjusting topical medications and performing visual field testing may help manage the patient's symptoms, it would not address the underlying cause of the elevated intraocular pressure and endothelial cell loss. The patient's history of eye color change and laser in situ karatomileusis surgery suggests that the elevated intraocular pressure may be related to these procedures, and surgical intervention may be necessary to resolve the issue.

C. Recommend increased frequency of ocular surface lubrication and anti-inflammatory medications: This choice is incorrect because while increased ocular surface lubrication and anti-inflammatory medications may help manage the patient's symptoms, they would not address the underlying cause of the elevated intraocular pressure and endothelial cell loss. The patient's history of eye color change and laser in situ karatomileusis surgery suggests that the elevated intraocular pressure may be related to these procedures, and surgical intervention may be necessary to resolve the issue.

D. Recommend a surgical intervention that will return his eyes to their original color: This choice is correct because it addresses the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, which may be related to the eye color change and laser in situ karatomileusis surgery. Surgical intervention to reverse the eye color change and/or remove any implants or material that may be contributing to the elevated intraocular pressure may be necessary to resolve the issue and prevent further damage to the patient's vision.

**Answer**: C. Offer carbamazepine and routine MRI

The patient in this case presents with intermittent esotropia and ptosis of the right eye, which have been persistent for years, following a pituitary adenoma resection and external beam radiation. The patient also has a history of diabetes, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.

The correct answer is C. Offer carbamazepine and routine MRI.

Carbamazepine is an anticonvulsant medication that is commonly used to treat various types of nerve damage, including peripheral nerve injuries. In this case, the patient's intermittent esotropia and ptosis suggest possible damage to the oculomotor nerve (CNIII) and/or the abducens nerve (CNVI), which control eye movements. Carbamazepine may help to reduce the symptoms of nerve damage and improve eye movements.

Routine MRI is also appropriate in this case, as it can help to identify any structural abnormalities in the brain or orbit that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. The patient's history of pituitary adenoma resection and external beam radiation increases the likelihood of finding a residual tumor or other structural abnormalities.

Now, let's discuss why the other answer choices are incorrect:

A. Topical apraclonidine test: Apraclonidine is an alpha-agonist medication that is used to test the function of the oculomotor nerve. However, in this case, the patient's symptoms suggest possible damage to the abducens nerve, which is not tested by apraclonidine. Therefore, this test would not provide useful information in this case.

B. Urgent MRI: While MRI is a useful diagnostic tool, there is no indication of urgency in this case. The patient's symptoms have been persistent for years, and there is no evidence of a sudden worsening of symptoms or other indications of an emergency.

D. Extraocular muscle surgery: Surgery may be necessary in some cases

**Answer**: B. Sweet syndrome

Sweet syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder that is characterized by the rapid development of painful, tender, and erythematous skin lesions. The patient's symptoms of painful skin lesions on his elbows, forearms, and legs, as well as the multitude of skin lesions, including raised follicular rash on both shins, painful flesh-colored raised nodules on the right knee, left index finger, and elbows, and painful raised circular violaceous papulonecrotic lesions with surrounding erythema and induration on the bilateral shins, left knee, right upper arm, and bilateral buttocks, are consistent with Sweet syndrome.

The patient's history of acute rheumatic fever and recent treatment with amoxicillin also support this diagnosis, as Sweet syndrome is known to occur in association with infections, particularly streptococcal infections. The patient's laboratory results, including an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level, are also consistent with Sweet syndrome.

The punch biopsy results, which showed a dermal neutrophilic infiltrate with normal Gram and Grocott methenamine silver stains, are also consistent with Sweet syndrome, as the disorder is characterized by a neutrophilic infiltrate in the dermis.

In contrast, pyoderma gangrenosum (choice A) is a rare skin disorder that is characterized by the rapid development of painful, ulcerative skin lesions, often associated with a history of trauma or infection. While the patient's skin lesions are painful and ulcerative, the absence of a history of trauma or infection and the presence of a multitude of skin lesions are not consistent with pyoderma gangrenosum.

Papillary dermal edema (choice C) is a condition characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the dermal papillae, leading to the formation of painless, flesh-colored or erythematous papules or nodules.

**Answer**:B. Start diuretic, implant cardioverter defibrillator, and evaluate for cardiac transplantation

The patient in this case has a history of recurrent atrial fibrillation (AF), chest pain, and dyspnea, which suggests a high risk of cardiac complications. The electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram results also indicate abnormalities in the heart's electrical activity and structure.

Option A, starting a diuretic, β-blocker, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, may help manage the patient's symptoms, but it does not address the underlying cause of the AF or the patient's high risk of cardiac complications.

Option C, discontinuing flecainide and starting amiodarone and warfarin, may be appropriate for managing the patient's arrhythmia, but it does not take into account the patient's symptoms or the abnormalities revealed by the ECG and echocardiogram.

Option D, proceeding with electrophysiology study and AF ablation, may be a viable option for managing the patient's arrhythmia, but it is not the most appropriate choice given the patient's history of recurrent AF and the abnormalities in the heart's structure and function.

In contrast, option B, starting a diuretic, implanting a cardioverter defibrillator, and evaluating the patient for cardiac transplantation, takes into account the patient's high risk of cardiac complications and addresses the underlying cause of the AF. The diuretic can help manage the patient's symptoms, while the cardioverter defibrillator can help prevent sudden cardiac death. Evaluating the patient for cardiac transplantation is also appropriate given the patient's history of recurrent AF and the abnormalities in the heart's structure and function.

Therefore, option B is the most appropriate answer.

**Answer**: D. Nodular fasciitis

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, as well as the imaging results and histopathological features, are consistent with a diagnosis of nodular fasciitis.

Nodular fasciitis is a benign condition characterized by a rapidly growing mass in the soft tissues, usually in the neck, axilla, or inguinal region. It is composed of fibroblastic and myofibroblastic cells arranged in a pattern of fascicles and has a characteristic "tissue-culture-like" appearance on histopathology.

The patient's symptoms of a 4-month history of a mass in the right supraclavicular region, along with cough and fatigue, are consistent with nodular fasciitis. The physical examination findings of a palpable, nontender, and freely movable mass in the right supraclavicular region also support this diagnosis.

The imaging results, which showed a 2.0-cm, right-sided supraclavicular mass just anterior and superior to the right subclavian vein with central patches of hypoattenuation, are also consistent with nodular fasciitis. The histopathological features of a benign spindle cell proliferation arranged in a tissue-culture-like pattern with a myxoid to collagenous stroma and positive immunohistochemical stains for actin and negative stains for cytokeratin and S100 protein further support this diagnosis.

In contrast, the other answer choices are less likely possibilities based on the patient's symptoms and clinical findings.

Proliferative myositis (choice A) is a rare condition characterized by the rapid growth of muscle cells, often in response to injury or inflammation. It can present with symptoms similar to those of nodular fasciitis, but the histopathological features are distinct, showing a proliferation of muscle cells with variable degrees of differentiation.

The correct answer is C. Odontogenic myxofibroma because it matches the clinical and histopathological features described in the case.

Odontogenic myxofibroma is a rare benign tumor that arises from the periodontal membrane of the teeth. It is characterized by a monotonous proliferation of stellate spindle cells with a variable extracellular matrix, which can range from loose myxoid to fibromyxoid and collagenous. The tumor often permeates adjacent bone marrow spaces.

In this case, the patient presented with a progressively enlarging right facial mass that was associated with the roots of the upper molar and premolar teeth. The histopathological analysis revealed a bland, monotonous proliferation of stellate spindle cells with a variable extracellular matrix, which is consistent with odontogenic myxofibroma. Additionally, the tumor permeated adjacent bone marrow spaces, which is also a characteristic feature of this entity.

The other answer choices do not match the clinical and histopathological features of the case.

A. Fibrous dysplasia is a developmental disorder that affects the bones and can result in the formation of expansile bony masses. However, it is not typically associated with teeth or the periodontal membrane.

B. Ameloblastic fibroma is a rare benign tumor that arises from the odontogenic epithelium. It is characterized by a proliferation of cuboidal or columnar cells that resemble ameloblasts, with a variable amount of extracellular matrix. However, it does not have the same histopathological features as odontogenic myxofibroma.

**Answer**:C. Tularemia

The patient's symptoms of severe sore throat, fever, chills, and neck swelling, along with the presence of bilateral tender lymphadenopathy and necrotic skin changes, are consistent with tularemia. The patient's history of ulcerative colitis may also increase the risk of developing tularemia. The negative gram stain and cultures for bacteria, fungi, and acid-fast bacilli, as well as the negative PCR for Bartonella henselae, suggest that the infection is not caused by a typical bacterial or fungal pathogen. The positive Francisella tularensis serum antibody titer supports the diagnosis of tularemia.

The other choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and laboratory results:

A. Tuberculous lymphadenitis: Tuberculosis (TB) can cause lymphadenitis, but the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not support this diagnosis. The patient's age and lack of respiratory symptoms make TB less likely. Additionally, the negative acid-fast bacillus cultures and PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis rule out TB.

B. Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease: Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease is a rare condition characterized by lymphadenitis and fever, but it typically affects younger patients and has a more benign course. The patient's age and severe symptoms make Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease less likely.

D. Cat-scratch disease: Cat-scratch disease is caused by Bartonella henselae and can cause lymphadenitis, but the patient's negative PCR for Bartonella henselae and the absence of any lesions in the upper aerodigestive tract make this diagnosis less likely.

**Answer**:C. Sarcoidosis

The correct answer is C. Sarcoidosis. The patient's symptoms of nasal congestion, facial pressure, purulent rhinorrhea, and hypo-osmia, as well as the physical examination findings of bilateral turbinate hypertrophy and significant nasal crusting, are consistent with chronic rhinosinusitis. The patient's history of chronic rhinosinusitis, allergic rhinitis, and asthma, as well as his use of fluticasone propionate and salmeterol (Advair) and albuterol, suggest a predisposition to respiratory inflammation. The patient's recent exposure to tuberculosis increases the likelihood of a diagnosis of sarcoidosis, as sarcoidosis is known to occur in association with tuberculosis. The patient's bilateral parotid swelling and tender, diffuse enlargement of the parotid glands, as well as the absence of masses or sialoliths on imaging, are consistent with sarcoidosis. The patient's negative test results for SSa/SSb levels, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), polymerase chain reaction (PCR), mumps titers, rapid plasma reagin, amylase, cytomegalovirus PCR, and quantiferon testing, as well as the absence of any other symptoms or signs of systemic disease, further support the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.

The other answer choices are less likely diagnoses for this patient's symptoms and findings.

A. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener granulomatosis): This diagnosis is less likely because the patient does not have any of the characteristic symptoms or findings of granulomatosis with polyangiitis, such as hemoptysis, cough, or lung infiltrates. Additionally, the patient's negative test results for SSa/SSb levels and the absence of any other symptoms or signs of systemic disease make this diagnosis less likely.

**Answer**:B. Low-grade cribriform cystadenocarcinoma

The correct answer is B, Low-grade cribriform cystadenocarcinoma, for the following reasons:

A. Papillary cystic acinic cell carcinoma: This type of cancer is typically seen in the salivary glands, particularly in the parotid gland. However, the patient's history of a unilateral cystic parotid lesion, the absence of pain or facial weakness, and the benign cytological features noted in the fine-needle aspiration suggest a lower-grade tumor. Papillary cystic acinic cell carcinoma tends to have a more aggressive clinical course and would be less likely to have these features.

C. Warthin tumor: This is a rare benign tumor that arises from the salivary glands, typically in the parotid gland. It is characterized by a cystic or partially cystic mass with a papillary or acinar architecture. However, the patient's history of a gradually increasing mass and the positive staining for calponin and p63 argue against this diagnosis.

D. Mammary analogue secretory carcinoma: This is a rare type of salivary gland cancer that is typically seen in the parotid gland. It has a more aggressive clinical course than the other options and tends to have a higher mitotic rate. The patient's history and the low Ki-67 rate argue against this diagnosis.

Therefore, based on the patient's history, the clinical findings, and the pathological features, the most likely diagnosis is B, Low-grade cribriform cystadenocarcinoma.

**Answer**:B. Obtain serum antinuclear antibody and lupus anticoagulant assay

The correct answer is B because the patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest the possibility of an autoimmune disorder, such as lupus. The patient's history of fevers, shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain, and lower extremity edema, along with the physical examination findings of bilateral cutaneous necrosis of the pinnae, are consistent with a systemic autoimmune disorder. The laboratory results support this diagnosis, as the patient has a high white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, and thrombocytopenia, which are all consistent with autoimmune hemolytic anemia. Additionally, the patient's partial thromboplastin time and international normalized ratio are consistent with a coagulopathy, which can be seen in autoimmune disorders.

The serum antinuclear antibody (ANA) and lupus anticoagulant assays can help support the diagnosis of lupus. The ANA test detects the presence of antibodies directed against the body's own tissues, which is a hallmark of autoimmune disorders. A positive ANA test result would suggest the presence of an autoimmune disorder, such as lupus. The lupus anticoagulant assay detects the presence of antibodies that can cause blood clots to form, which is a common complication of lupus. A positive lupus anticoagulant assay result would support the diagnosis of lupus and indicate the need for further testing and treatment.

Option A, perform a skin biopsy with indirect immunofluorescence, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of cutaneous necrosis, but it is not the most appropriate next step in the patient's management. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a systemic autoimmune disorder, and the skin lesions may be a manifestation of this disorder. Therefore, it is important to first evaluate the patient for an autoimmune disorder before proceeding with a skin biopsy.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is B: Her ascites is primarily due to chronically elevated pressures on the right side of her heart.

The patient's history of long-standing pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and the physical examination findings of jugular venous distension, accentuated P2, and holosystolic murmur in the left lower sternal border suggest that she has right-sided heart failure. This is supported by the laboratory results, which show an elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) level of 120 pg/mL (normal < 100 pg/mL). The patient's ascites is likely a result of neurohumoral activation and increased venous pressure due to right-sided heart failure, rather than cirrhosis or abdominal malignancy.

Choice A, "Her ascites is primarily due to cirrhosis," is incorrect because the patient has no history of alcohol or drug use and no personal or family history of liver disease. Additionally, the laboratory results do not show any evidence of liver dysfunction, such as elevated liver enzymes or low albumin.

Choice C, "Her ascites is primarily due to abdominal malignancy," is also incorrect. While the patient's age and presence of ascites may suggest the possibility of abdominal malignancy, there is no evidence to support this diagnosis. The patient's history and physical examination do not reveal any signs of abdominal pain or mass, and the laboratory results do not show any evidence of malignancy, such as an elevated carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level.

Choice D, "Her ascites is primarily due to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis," is unlikely given the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory results. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a serious complication of ascites in patients with liver cirrhosis, but it is unlikely in this patient given her lack of liver disease and the absence of signs of infection, such as fever, tachycardia, or leukocytosis.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is B: Stop azathioprine.

The patient's symptoms of fever, lethargy, polyarticular arthralgias, and painful rash on the extensor surfaces of his lower and upper extremities are consistent with a hypersensitivity reaction to azathioprine. The fact that the patient's symptoms began 10 days after starting azathioprine and that his thiopurine methyltransferase activity was normal suggest that the reaction is unlikely to be due to a genetic predisposition.

Option A, checking angiotensin-converting enzyme level, is not relevant to the patient's symptoms and would not help in diagnosing or managing the hypersensitivity reaction.

Option C, commencing corticosteroids, may be considered in the management of severe hypersensitivity reactions, but it is not the most appropriate step at this point in the patient's care.

Option D, performing a punch skin biopsy, is not necessary to diagnose the hypersensitivity reaction and may not provide any useful information.

Therefore, the most appropriate step in the patient's care would be to stop azathioprine, which is the medication most likely causing the hypersensitivity reaction. This will help to prevent further complications and allow the patient's symptoms to resolve.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

**Answer**: B. Lynch syndrome is suspected.

The patient's family history of prostate cancer in her father and paternal grandfather suggests a possible inherited predisposition to cancer. The patient's endometrial cancer diagnosis at age 43 also supports this possibility.

The tumor screening results show that the patient's tumor has high microsatellite instability (MSI-H), which is a hallmark of Lynch syndrome. Additionally, the patient's tumor is negative for MLH1 and MSH6, which are two of the four DNA mismatch repair proteins that are typically lost in Lynch syndrome-related cancers.

However, the patient's tumor is positive for PMS2, which is a third DNA mismatch repair protein that is less frequently lost in Lynch syndrome-related cancers. This positive PMS2 result suggests that the patient's tumor may have a different mechanism of microsatellite instability, such as a defect in the PMS2 gene itself or in another gene that interacts with the DNA mismatch repair pathway.

Therefore, while the patient's tumor screening results are consistent with Lynch syndrome, they do not definitively confirm the diagnosis. Further genetic testing, such as germline DNA testing for mutations in DNA mismatch repair genes, would be needed to confirm or rule out Lynch syndrome.

In summary, choice B, "Lynch syndrome is suspected," is the correct answer because the patient's tumor screening results suggest a possible inherited predisposition to cancer, but do not definitively confirm Lynch syndrome. Choices A, C, and D are incorrect because they do not accurately reflect the patient's test results and clinical presentation.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain why D. Secondary syphilis is the correct answer and why the other choices are incorrect.

**Answer**: D. Secondary syphilis

Secondary syphilis is a stage of syphilis that occurs weeks to months after the initial infection. It is characterized by the formation of lesions on the skin and mucous membranes, which can be ulcerative and crusted, similar to the lesions described in the case. The patient's history of remote cocaine use increases the likelihood of a sexually transmitted infection like syphilis. The patient's age and medical history, including hypertension, cerebrovascular accident, and colon cancer, also increase the likelihood of a sexually transmitted infection.

The patient's symptoms, including the abrupt onset of pruritic crusted papules and nodules on the face and genitals, are consistent with secondary syphilis. The presence of similar lesions on the scrotum and inner thighs, with sparing of the penis, is also consistent with secondary syphilis. The patient's report of no recent sexual intercourse, penile discharge, fevers, chills, nausea, or vomiting reduces the likelihood of other sexually transmitted infections.

The negative Warthin-Starry silver impregnation stain and the absence of lymphadenopathy also support the diagnosis of secondary syphilis. The patient's history of colon cancer increases the likelihood of a metastatic lesion, but the absence of lymphadenopathy and the presence of crusted papules and nodules on the face and genitals make this diagnosis less likely.

Now, let's discuss why the other choices are incorrect:

A. Atypical mycobacterium infection: This diagnosis is less likely because the patient does not have a history of exposure to mycobacteria, and the lesions do not have the characteristic appearance of mycobacterial infections.

B. Cryptococcal infection: This diagnosis is less likely because the patient does not have a history of exposure to cryptococcus, and the lesions do not have the characteristic appearance of

**Answer**: C. Granulomatous manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease

The correct answer is C. Granulomatous manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease because the patient's symptoms and biopsy results are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient has a history of Crohn's disease, which is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that can cause granulomas to form in various parts of the body, including the skin. The biopsy results show a dermal perivascular and nodular infiltrate composed of aggregates of histiocytes and numerous multinucleate giant cells surrounded by mature lymphocytes, which is consistent with a granulomatous response. Additionally, the patient's symptoms of painful perianal skin growths and the cobblestone-like surface of the plaque are also consistent with this diagnosis.

Now, let's discuss why the other answer choices are incorrect:

A. Fibroepithelial polyps: These are benign growths that occur on the skin, usually in the anal canal. They are not associated with IBD or granulomas.

B. External hemorrhoids: These are swollen veins in the anal canal that can cause pain, itching, and bleeding. They are not associated with IBD or granulomas.

D. Condyloma acuminata: These are precancerous lesions caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) that can occur in the anal canal. They are not associated with IBD or granulomas.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and biopsy results, the most likely diagnosis is C. Granulomatous manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease.

**Answer**: C. Cutaneous sparganosis

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results, along with the histopathological analysis of the punch biopsy specimen, are consistent with cutaneous sparganosis. The serpiginous erythematous plaque on the abdomen and the presence of eosinophilic cuticle and calcareous bodies in the histopathological analysis are characteristic features of cutaneous sparganosis.

Gnathostomiasis is a parasitic infection caused by Gnathostoma spinigerum, which is commonly found in freshwater environments. While the patient's exposure to well water may suggest a possible risk of gnathostomiasis, the absence of other symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss, as well as the lack of Gnathostoma eggs in the stool, make it less likely.

Myiasis is a parasitic infection caused by the larvae of various fly species. While the patient's itchy lesion may suggest myiasis, the absence of other symptoms such as pain, swelling, and discharge, as well as the lack of fly larvae in the biopsy specimen, make it less likely.

Strongyloidiasis is a parasitic infection caused by Strongyloides stercoralis, which can cause skin lesions. However, the patient's history of living in a farm community that used well water for drinking, and the absence of other symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss, as well as the lack of Strongyloides larvae in the stool, make it less likely.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and histopathological analysis, cutaneous sparganosis is the most likely diagnosis.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain why B. Gallstone is the correct answer and why the other choices are incorrect.

**Answer**: B. Gallstone

The patient's symptoms of acute onset upper abdominal pain, localized to the epigastrium, and tenderness in the same area, are consistent with a gallstone. The patient's history of dyslipidemia also increases her risk for gallstones. The laboratory results show normocytic anemia, which could be a result of chronic blood loss from a gallstone. The abdominal radiography shows a rounded radio-opaque lesion in the right side of the mid to lower quadrant, at the level of L5 vertebral body, which is consistent with a gallstone.

**Answer**: A. Calcified hydatid cyst

A hydatid cyst is a parasitic infection caused by the larval form of the dog tapeworm, Echinococcus granulosus. The patient's occupation as a sheep breeder and her close contact with animals increases her risk of exposure to the parasite. However, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not support this diagnosis. The patient's anemia and abdominal pain are not typical symptoms of a hydatid cyst. Additionally, the lesion seen on the abdominal radiography does not have the characteristic "ring-like" appearance of a hydatid cyst.

**Answer**: C. Calcified bowel mass

A calcified bowel mass can cause abdominal pain and tenderness, but it is not typically associated with anemia. The patient's history of dyslipidemia and the lesion seen on the abdominal radiography are not consistent with a calcified bowel mass.

**Answer**: D. Swallowed foreign body

A swallowed foreign body can cause abdominal pain and tenderness, but it is not typically associated with anemia.

The correct answer is C. Secondary splenic cyst.

A secondary splenic cyst is a type of cyst that develops in the spleen as a result of trauma, infection, or inflammation. The patient's history of a routine physical examination and the absence of any history of abdominal trauma, infection, or surgery make it unlikely that the cyst is a congenital splenic cyst (B). Additionally, the presence of mural calcification and the eggshell-like appearance of the cyst surface are not typical features of congenital splenic cysts.

Echinococcal disease (A) is a parasitic infection caused by the larvae of Echinococcus granulosus, which can form cysts in various organs, including the spleen. However, the patient's lack of symptoms and the absence of any history of exposure to the parasite make it unlikely that the cyst is caused by Echinococcus.

Splenic abscess (D) is a collection of pus in the spleen, usually caused by bacterial infection. The patient's lack of symptoms and the absence of any signs of infection, such as fever or leukocytosis, make it unlikely that the cyst is an abscess.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a secondary splenic cyst, which is a type of cyst that develops in the spleen as a result of trauma, infection, or inflammation.

**Answer**:B. Test for antiretinal antibodies

The correct answer is B. Test for antiretinal antibodies because it is the most appropriate next step in the evaluation of this patient's symptoms. The patient's sudden onset of bilateral vision loss, along with the physical examination findings of unreactive pupils and mild nuclear sclerosis, suggest the possibility of an autoimmune or inflammatory condition affecting the retina. Antiretinal antibodies are commonly associated with autoimmune retinopathies, such as autoimmune retinopathy and retinal autoimmune melanosis. Testing for these antibodies can help confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.

A. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits with gadolinium is not the most appropriate next step because it is unlikely to provide information that would change the management of the patient's vision loss. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest a structural problem in the brain or orbits that would be detected by MRI.

C. Syphilis and tuberculosis testing are not the most appropriate next steps because there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has a syphilitic or tuberculous infection. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest a systemic infection, and the patient's history of postmenopausal bleeding and bilateral vision loss is not consistent with the typical presentation of syphilis or tuberculosis.

D. Obtaining an erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level may be appropriate at some point in the patient's evaluation, but it is not the most appropriate next step. These tests are used to evaluate for systemic inflammation, but they are not specific to the patient's vision loss and do not provide information that would guide immediate management.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is C. Start oral prednisone therapy.

Prednisone is a corticosteroid that is commonly used to treat inflammatory conditions, including uveitis, which is inflammation of the uvea (the middle layer of the eye). The patient's symptoms of painless vision loss, hyperemia, and subretinal fluid at the fovea are consistent with uveitis. The elevated whitish lesion in the superotemporal quadrant of the right eye is also consistent with a choroidal mass, which can be a sign of uveitis.

Starting oral prednisone therapy would be an appropriate next step in the management of this patient's condition. The corticosteroid will help to reduce the inflammation in the eye and alleviate the symptoms.

Now, let's discuss why the other answer choices are incorrect:

A. Order magnetic resonance imaging of the orbit: While MRI imaging may be useful in some cases of uveitis, it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's management. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of uveitis, and starting corticosteroid therapy is a more urgent priority.

B. Refer to oncology for metastatic workups: This patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest a metastatic process. The choroidal mass observed on fundus examination is more consistent with a benign choroidal tumor, such as a choroidal nevi or a choroidal melanoma. Therefore, referring the patient to oncology for metastatic workups would not be the most appropriate next step.

D. Schedule transscleral or transvitreal biopsy: Biopsy may be necessary in some cases of uveitis to establish the diagnosis, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's management. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with uveitis, and starting corticosteroid therapy is a more urgent priority. Additionally, biopsy carries risks, such as infection and vision loss,

**Answer**: D. Refer the patient back to her oncologist

Explanation:

A. Broaden empirical antimicrobial coverage:
This choice is incorrect because the patient's history of non-small cell lung cancer, recent chemotherapy, and immunosuppression suggests that the retinal lesion is likely related to her systemic cancer or its treatment, rather than an infectious cause. Empirical antimicrobial coverage may not address the underlying cause of the lesion.

B. Perform vitrectomy, with vitreous polymerase chain reaction:
This choice is incorrect because vitrectomy and vitreous polymerase chain reaction may not be necessary at this stage, given the patient's recent treatment with intravitreous injection of foscarnet sodium and ganciclovir sodium. Additionally, the patient's lesion is located in the macula, which may make vitrectomy more challenging.

C. Obtain a chorioretinal fine-needle aspiration biopsy sample of the lesion:
This choice is incorrect because fine-needle aspiration biopsy may not be the best approach for diagnosing retinal lesions, especially in the setting of immunosuppression and recent cancer treatment. The risk of seeding the lesion or introducing infection may outweigh the potential benefits of biopsy.

D. Refer the patient back to her oncologist:
This choice is correct because the patient's history of non-small cell lung cancer and recent chemotherapy suggests that the retinal lesion may be related to her systemic cancer or its treatment. Given the atypical presentation and indeterminate diagnosis, it is appropriate to refer the patient back to her oncologist for further evaluation and management. The oncologist may consider imaging studies, laboratory tests, or other interventions to address the underlying cause of the lesion.

**Answer**:C. Embolization followed by orbitotomy and biopsy

The patient's symptoms of proptosis and pressure sensation behind the left eye, along with the physical examination findings of moderate restriction to elevation of the left eye and Hertel exophthalmometer measurements of 7 mm of proptosis OS, suggest a possible orbital mass. The imaging studies, including computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, confirm the presence of a well-demarcated, ovoid mass within the medial intraconal space, which displaces the globe inferiorly and anteriorly. The angiography findings demonstrate a tortuous branch of the left ophthalmic artery supplying the medial aspect of the orbital mass.

Given these findings, the most appropriate next step would be to perform embolization followed by orbitotomy and biopsy. Embolization is a minimally invasive procedure that involves blocking the blood supply to the tumor, which can help reduce the risk of bleeding during surgery and improve the outcome. Orbitotomy is a surgical procedure that involves creating an incision in the orbit to access the tumor and remove it. Biopsy is necessary to establish the diagnosis of the tumor and guide further management.

Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (choice A) may not be sufficient to establish a definitive diagnosis, especially for a well-demarcated, ovoid mass that is displacing the globe. Fluorescein angiography (choice B) may be useful in evaluating the retinal circulation, but it would not provide information about the nature of the orbital mass. Observation (choice D) would not be appropriate given the presence of a well-demarcated, ovoid mass that is displacing the globe and causing symptoms.

Psoriasis is a chronic skin condition characterized by thick, scaly, red, and sometimes itchy patches on the skin. The description of the rash in the case, including the pink to brown nummular patches and plaques with thick white scale on the scalp, cheeks, trunk, back, axillae, inguinal crease, scrotum, and umbilicus, is consistent with psoriasis. The fact that the rash has been present for 4 weeks and has not responded to topical anti-yeast medications or moisturizers also supports this diagnosis.

**Answer**: B. Langerhans cell histiocytosis

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the skin and other organs. It is characterized by the proliferation of Langerhans cells, which are a type of immune cell that is found in the skin. The rash in this case does not have the characteristic features of LCH, such as the presence of scaly, crusted, or waxy lesions, or the involvement of the skin folds, face, or scalp. Additionally, LCH typically affects children under the age of 10, and the patient in this case is 2 months old, which makes it less likely that this is the correct diagnosis.

Congenital syphilis is a rare condition that occurs when a fetus is infected with syphilis during pregnancy. It can cause a variety of skin lesions, including rashes, sores, and ulcers. However, the rash in this case does not have the characteristic features of congenital syphilis, such as the presence of rough, red, or reddish-brown lesions on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is B. Myocardial restriction.

Myocardial restriction refers to a condition where the heart muscle becomes stiff and cannot contract properly, leading to reduced cardiac output. This can occur due to various causes such as radiation therapy, which the patient in this case had undergone for Hodgkin lymphoma at age 17. The patient's history of mantle chest radiotherapy suggests that the radiation may have caused damage to the heart muscle, leading to myocardial restriction.

The patient's symptoms of progressive dyspnea on exertion and severe lower extremity edema are consistent with myocardial restriction, as the heart is unable to pump enough blood to meet the body's demands. The patient's history of aortic stenosis and coronary artery bypass surgery also support this diagnosis, as these conditions can also contribute to myocardial restriction.

The neck examination findings, which revealed a regular carotid pulsation and discernible internal jugular venous pulse, are also consistent with myocardial restriction. The patient's neck examination at rest and during a small breath hold did not reveal any abnormalities, which suggests that the patient's jugular venous pulse is normal and there is no evidence of tamponade (choice A).

The hemodynamic data shown in Figure 1B, which demonstrates a high-fidelity micromanometer simultaneous recording of the left ventricular (LV) and right atrial (RA) pressures, also supports the diagnosis of myocardial restriction. The LV pressure tracing shows a reduced systolic pressure and a prolonged decay time, indicating reduced cardiac output. The RA pressure tracing shows a prominent X descent, which is consistent with myocardial restriction.

In contrast, choice A, tamponade, is not supported by the patient's neck examination findings or the hemodynamic data. Tamponade occurs when there is an accumulation of fluid in the pericardial sac surrounding the heart, which can cause compression of the heart and impair its ability to function. The patient's neck examination did not reveal any evidence of fluid accumulation

In this case, the patient presented with a slowly enlarging left facial mass, which was found to be arising from the deep lobe of the parotid gland and causing loss of the fat plane between the parapharyngeal space and masticator space with subsequent inflammation of the pterygoid space. The mass was surgically resected and histopathological examination showed sections of confluent amorphous eosinophilic masses with surrounding foreign-body giant cell reaction and lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates. Additionally, sheets of plasma cells were positive for κ and CD138 and negative for λ, consistent with clonal κ light-chain restricted plasma cell infiltrates around amorphous tissue. Congo red stain showed apple-green birefringence demonstrated on polarized microscopy.

These findings are consistent with amyloidosis. The presence of amyloid fibrils in the tissue can cause inflammation and mass effect, leading to the symptoms and signs described in the case. The positive staining for κ and CD138 and negative staining for λ on the plasma cells suggests that the amyloidosis is of the κ light-chain type.

The other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and signs.

A. Pleomorphic adenoma is a type of benign salivary gland tumor that can occur in the parotid gland. However, it is unlikely to cause the patient's symptoms and signs, as it typically presents as a painless mass in the parotid gland and does not cause inflammation or effacement of the pharyngeal mucosa.

**Answer**: C. Myeloid sarcoma of the larynx

The patient's symptoms of hoarseness, throat pain, dysphagia, and odynophagia, along with the physical examination findings of a "breathy" voice and an immobile right vocal fold, suggest a laryngeal lesion. The patient's history of AML and myelodysplastic syndrome increase the likelihood of a hematologic malignancy.

The computed tomography (CT) scan and flexible nasal endoscopy findings support the presence of a laryngeal mass. The histopathologic analysis demonstrates a mixed infiltrate containing numerous mononuclear myeloid cells positive for myeloperoxidase, CD34, CD68, and CD33 but negative for CD117, which is consistent with myeloid sarcoma.

Myeloid sarcoma, also known as granulocytic sarcoma, is a rare extramedullary tumor that can arise in various parts of the body, including the larynx. It is composed of immature myeloid cells and can have a variable clinical presentation. In this case, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a laryngeal lesion, and the histopathologic analysis supports the diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma.

The other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and findings.

A. Laryngeal lymphoma: Lymphoma is a malignancy of the immune system and can affect the larynx. However, the patient's history of AML and myelodysplastic syndrome, along with the histopathologic analysis, make myeloid sarcoma a more likely diagnosis.

**Answer**: B. Osseous choristoma

The correct answer is B. Osseous choristoma because it matches the given symptoms and test results.

An osseous choristoma is a rare benign tumor that develops from the remnants of the embryonic nasal capsule. It usually presents as a slow-growing mass in the nasal cavity or paranasal sinuses, but can also occur in other parts of the head and neck, such as the tongue. The patient's symptoms of a gradually enlarging mass on the tongue without pain or other symptoms, as well as the physical examination findings of a pedunculated mass on the posterior dorsal tongue, are consistent with an osseous choristoma.

The histopathologic examination results also support this diagnosis. The presence of mature bone with overlying mildly hyperplastic stratified squamous epithelium and no surrounding inflammation is consistent with an osseous choristoma. The core of dense lamellar osseous matrix with numerous Haversian canals and associated regularly dispersed osteocytes in lacunae is also characteristic of this condition.

In contrast, pleomorphic adenoma (choice A) is a type of salivary gland tumor that usually occurs in the parotid gland, but can also occur in other salivary glands, including the tongue. It is a malignant tumor that can infiltrate surrounding tissues and has a higher recurrence rate than osseous choristoma. The histopathologic features of pleomorphic adenoma are different from those of osseous choristoma, showing a variety of cell types, including epithelial, myoepithelial, and mesenchymal cells, arranged in a haphazard pattern.

Dermoid cyst (choice C) is a type of benign tumor that originates from ectodermal tissue and usually occurs in the skin or organs derived from ectoderm. It is composed of a variety of tissues, including skin, hair follicles, sweat glands, and sebaceous glands.

**Answer**:C. Extraosseous chordoma

The patient's symptoms of chronic bilateral nasal congestion, absence of facial pressure, pain, paresthesia, bleeding, dysphagia, or voice change, and physical examination findings of thick, clear to yellow mucus bilaterally in the nasal cavities and bilateral inferior turbinate hypertrophy, as well as the absence of lymphadenopathy, suggest a diagnosis of a nasopharyngeal mass.

The patient's age and the absence of bony erosion or calcification on CT scan also support this diagnosis.

The MRI findings of a hypointense lesion on T1 sequence and hyperintense on T2 sequence with mild heterogeneous enhancement are consistent with a chordoma, which is a type of rare, slow-growing tumor that arises from the notochord, a structure that runs along the length of the spine and nasopharynx.

The absence of a clival sinus tract, which is a common finding in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, also supports the diagnosis of chordoma.

The fact that the lesion is located in the nasopharynx and has an irregular surface and firm consistency, as well as the presence of mucosal edema, also support the diagnosis of chordoma.

Thornwaldt cyst, which is a rare, benign cystic lesion that arises from the remnants of the Thornwaldt's duct, is an unlikely diagnosis given the patient's age and the absence of a connection to the nasal cavity.

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a possibility, but the absence of symptoms such as facial pressure, pain, paresthesia, bleeding, dysphagia, or voice change, as well as the absence of lymphadenopathy, make it less likely.

Meningocele, which is a rare, congenital, benign protrusion of the meninges through a skull defect, is also an unlikely diagnosis given the patient's age and the absence

**Answer**: B. Perform microscopic urinalysis to confirm the presence of blood in the urine.

The correct answer is B because it is the most appropriate next step in the evaluation of hematuria. Microscopic urinalysis can confirm the presence of blood in the urine and also identify other possible causes of hematuria such as infection, inflammation, or kidney damage. This step is crucial in determining the underlying cause of hematuria before proceeding with further diagnostic tests or interventions.

**Answer**: A. Perform a computed tomographic scan to evaluate for source of hematuria.

While a computed tomographic (CT) scan can be useful in evaluating the source of hematuria, it is not the most appropriate next step. A CT scan may not be able to detect the source of hematuria, especially if it is originating from the lower urinary tract. Additionally, a CT scan may expose the patient to radiation and contrast dye, which may not be necessary at this stage of the evaluation.

**Answer**: C. Refer to urology for cystoscopy to evaluate the source of hematuria.

Referring the patient to urology for cystoscopy may be appropriate eventually, but it is not the most appropriate next step. Cystoscopy is an invasive procedure that requires specialized equipment and expertise, and it may not be necessary if the source of hematuria can be identified through less invasive means.

**Answer**: D. Perform urine cytology to evaluate for malignancy.

While urine cytology can be useful in detecting malignant cells in the urine, it is not the most appropriate next step in the evaluation of hematuria. The patient's history of hypertension and laminectomy, as well as the absence of other symptoms, suggests that the hematuria is likely due to a non-malignant cause. Additionally, urine cytology may not be able to detect the source of hematuria.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to perform microscopic urinalysis to confirm the presence of blood in the urine and identify any other possible causes of hematuria.

**Answer**:B. Focal dermal hypoplasia (Goltz syndrome)

The correct answer is B, Focal dermal hypoplasia (Goltz syndrome), because it matches the patient's symptoms and clinical findings, which include:

* Irregular, dark brown, well-demarcated macules within prominent soft, yellow, papular protrusions in a Blaschkolinear arrangement on the upper arms, and linear, atrophic pink plaques with focal erosions and crusting on the right flank.
* Extracutaneous features such as syndactyly of the toes and ventral pterygium and dystrophy of the toe nails.
* Histopathologic slides from the prior excision of affected skin showed close proximity of subcutaneous fat to the epidermis with attenuated collagen.

Focal dermal hypoplasia (Goltz syndrome) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by skin and soft tissue abnormalities, including skin lesions, linear atrophic plaques, and syndactyly. The skin lesions are typically irregular, dark brown, well-demarcated macules within prominent soft, yellow, papular protrusions in a Blaschkolinear arrangement, which is consistent with the patient's skin lesions on her upper arms. The linear, atrophic pink plaques with focal erosions and crusting on the right flank are also consistent with the patient's clinical findings. Additionally, the patient's extracutaneous features such as syndactyly of the toes and ventral pterygium and dystrophy of the toe nails are also consistent with Focal dermal hypoplasia (Goltz syndrome).

The other choices do not match the patient's symptoms and clinical findings:

**Answer**: C. Incontinentia pigmenti

Incontinentia pigmenti (IC) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the skin and nervous system. It is characterized by the development of vesicles or blisters on the skin, which can be arranged in a linear or whorled pattern. The vesicles typically contain a clear fluid and may be accompanied by hyperpigmentation or depigmentation of the surrounding skin.

The case described in the question matches the characteristics of IC. The patient developed vesicles on her trunk and lower extremities that were arranged in a linear pattern, and the lesions appeared on the 13th day of life. The patient's mother reported that the lesions had started 2 days prior, which is consistent with the typical age of onset for IC, which is usually within the first few weeks of life.

The other answer choices do not fit the case as well:

A. Congenital herpes zoster: This is a rare condition in which a baby is born with a reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus, which causes chickenpox. It can cause vesicles, but they are typically not arranged in a linear pattern, and the condition is usually associated with other symptoms such as fever, lethargy, and seizures.

B. Neonatal pustular melanosis: This is a rare condition that causes pustules to form on the skin of newborns. The pustules are typically darker than the surrounding skin and may be accompanied by hyperpigmentation. However, the pustules in neonatal pustular melanosis are not typically arranged in a linear pattern, and the condition is not associated with the development of vesicles.

D. Linear and whorled nevoid hypermelanosis: This is a rare condition that causes hyperpigmentation of the skin in a linear or whorled pattern. However, it does not involve the development of vesicles, and the hyperpigmentation is typically present at birth or develops within the first few months of life.

Therefore, based on the characteristics of the case, the most likely diagnosis is incontinentia pigmenti.

**Answer**: C. Xanthoma disseminatum

Xanthoma disseminatum is a rare benign condition characterized by the development of multiple yellowish-red papules on the skin, particularly in the axillae, neck, and upper back. The condition is often associated with diabetes mellitus, obesity, and familial hypercholesterolemia. The patient's history of polyuria and polydipsia, along with the presence of coalescing reddish-yellow papules in the axillae, are consistent with this diagnosis.

The histopathological findings of histiocytes with foam cells, scattered lymphocytes, and few plasma cells, as well as the presence of a classic wreath-like Touton cell, are also consistent with Xanthoma disseminatum. The positive immunohistochemistry staining for CD68 antibody further supports this diagnosis.

Now, let's discuss why the other answer choices are incorrect:

A. Acanthosis nigricans: Acanthosis nigricans is a condition characterized by dark, velvety patches on the skin, particularly in the axillae, neck, and groin. While it may share some similarities with Xanthoma disseminatum in terms of skin involvement, the histopathological features are distinct. Acanthosis nigricans is associated with an increase in melanin production and has a different histopathological appearance, with prominent hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and pigmentation.

B. Eruptive xanthomas: Eruptive xanthomas are small, yellowish papules that can appear on the skin, often in response to certain medications or systemic conditions. However, they are typically not associated with the axillae and do not have the same histopathological features as Xanthoma disseminatum.

D. Axillary granular parakeratosis: Axillary granular parakeratosis is a condition characterized by small, rough papules on the skin of the axillae. While it may share some similarities with Xanthoma disseminatum in terms of skin involvement, the hist

**Answer**: C. A space-occupying mucocele of the nasopharynx

The patient's symptoms of a unilateral headache located in her left cheek, eye, and forehead, along with ipsilateral lacrimation, red eye, and periorbital swelling, are consistent with a diagnosis of a space-occupying mucocele of the nasopharynx. A mucocele is a benign tumor that arises from the nasal cavity or paranasal sinuses and can cause symptoms similar to sinusitis or rhinitis. The patient's age and lack of other symptoms such as nasal congestion, nausea, vomiting, or phonophobia also support this diagnosis.

Option A, cluster headache, is unlikely since the patient's symptoms are not consistent with the typical characteristics of a cluster headache, which includes severe pain on one side of the head, often described as piercing or burning in nature, and tearing and redness of the eye on the same side. The patient's symptoms are more consistent with a unilateral headache and swelling of the eye and periorbital area.

Option B, Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, is also unlikely since it is a rare condition characterized by unilateral pain, swelling, and redness of the eye and periorbital area, along with a retrobulbar mass. The patient's symptoms do not include a retrobulbar mass, and the swelling and redness are not confined to the eye.

Option D, acute angle-closure glaucoma, is unlikely since the patient's symptoms do not include blurred vision, eye pain, or nausea and vomiting, which are typical symptoms of acute angle-closure glaucoma. Additionally, the patient's age is relatively young for this condition, which typically affects older adults.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, option C, a space-occupying mucocele of the nasopharynx, is the most likely diagnosis.

**Answer**: B. Bilateral femoral hernia

The patient's symptoms of pain in the right groin that radiates down the right leg, along with the absence of an inguinal protrusion or mass, suggest a possible femoral hernia. A femoral hernia occurs when a portion of the intestine or other tissue protrudes through a weakened area in the abdominal wall, typically on one side of the groin. Bilateral femoral hernia is a less common variation of this condition, where a hernia occurs on both sides of the groin.

The patient's history of chronic constipation and use of laxatives also supports this diagnosis, as straining during bowel movements can increase the risk of developing a femoral hernia. Additionally, the patient's age and presence of diabetes may also increase the likelihood of this diagnosis, as older adults and those with diabetes are at higher risk for developing hernias.

The absence of any neurological or vascular deficits and the normal results of the abdominal physical examination also support this diagnosis, as femoral hernias typically do not cause these types of symptoms.

The abdominal CT scans shown in the figure do not reveal any obvious signs of a hernia, but they do show some evidence of bilateral femoral hernias, such as a small bulge in the right groin area and a possible hernia sac in the left groin area.

In summary, the patient's symptoms, medical history, and physical examination findings, along with the results of the abdominal CT scans, suggest that the most likely diagnosis is bilateral femoral hernia. Therefore, the correct answer is B. Bilateral femoral hernia.

As for the other answer choices:

A. Right inguinal hernia: This is an incorrect choice because the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not support this diagnosis. Inguinal hernias typically present with a bulge in the groin area that is visible and palpable, and the patient did not report any such symptoms.

The correct answer is D. Annular pancreas.

Annular pancreas is a rare condition where a band of pancreatic tissue forms a ring around the duodenum, causing obstruction and narrowing of the duodenal lumen. This can lead to symptoms such as abdominal pain, weight loss, nausea, and vomiting, which are similar to the symptoms presented by the patient in the case. The patient's history of a 6-month duration of symptoms and the absence of any notable abnormalities on physical examination also support this diagnosis.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Fibrosis owing to chronic peptic ulceration: While fibrosis can cause narrowing of the duodenal lumen, it is unlikely to cause a complete obstruction as seen in this case. Additionally, the patient's history of a 6-month duration of symptoms and the absence of any notable abnormalities on physical examination do not support this diagnosis.

B. Duodenal carcinoma: Duodenal carcinoma can cause obstruction of the duodenum, but it would typically present with more severe symptoms and signs of malignancy, such as a mass on physical examination or abnormal liver function tests. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not support this diagnosis.

C. Duodenal web: A duodenal web is a rare congenital anomaly that can cause narrowing of the duodenal lumen. However, it is unlikely to cause a complete obstruction as seen in this case, and the patient's history and symptoms do not support this diagnosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Annular pancreas.

**Answer**:B. Initiate treatment with oral valacyclovir

The correct answer is B, Initiate treatment with oral valacyclovir, because the patient's symptoms and clinical findings suggest a diagnosis of herpes zoster (shingles) involving the left upper eyelid. The presence of an ulcerated lesion with surrounding edema, madarosis, and a tender preauricular lymph node are all consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's history of mild boggy edema and foreign-body sensation in the left eye, as well as the absence of vision changes, light sensitivity, or drainage from the eye, also support this diagnosis.

Herpes zoster is caused by the varicella-zoster virus and is typically treated with antiviral medications such as valacyclovir. Oral valacyclovir is effective in reducing the severity and duration of herpes zoster symptoms, and is the treatment of choice for this condition.

The other answer choices are not appropriate for this patient's condition:

A, Perform wide local excision with map biopsies, is not necessary for this patient as the diagnosis of herpes zoster does not require surgical intervention.

C, Proceed with cryotherapy, is not appropriate for this patient as cryotherapy is not a recommended treatment for herpes zoster.

D, Perform Mohs micrographic surgery followed by reconstruction with flap, is not necessary for this patient as the diagnosis of herpes zoster does not require surgical intervention.

Therefore, the correct answer is B, Initiate treatment with oral valacyclovir.

**Answer**: B. Human immunodeficiency virus testing and lymphocyte analysis

The correct answer is B, Human immunodeficiency virus testing and lymphocyte analysis, because the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a possible diagnosis of herpes zoster ophthalmicus, which is caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). VZV can cause a variety of ocular manifestations, including conjunctivitis, keratitis, and uveitis, as seen in this patient. However, it's important to consider other causes of these symptoms, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

HIV testing is necessary because HIV can cause a variety of ocular manifestations, including keratitis, uveitis, and retinal detachment. HIV-associated keratitis can have a similar appearance to herpetic keratitis, and it's important to differentiate between the two conditions to provide appropriate treatment and prevent complications. Additionally, HIV can affect the immune system, which can increase the risk of opportunistic infections, such as herpes zoster ophthalmicus.

Lymphocyte analysis is also necessary to evaluate the patient's immune status. Lymphocyte subsets can help identify immune deficiencies, which can increase the risk of opportunistic infections. In this case, the patient's history of a heart murmur and the presence of a vesicular rash suggest a possible immune deficiency.

The other answer choices are not as appropriate for the following reasons:

A. Obtain a corneal culture: While a corneal culture may be useful in diagnosing bacterial or fungal keratitis, it's not necessary in this case because the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a viral infection, and a corneal culture would not help differentiate between HSV and VZV.

D. Check serology results for exposure to infectious agents

Explanation:

A. Add steroids: This choice is incorrect because steroids are not typically used to treat CMV retinitis. While steroids may be used to treat other types of retinal inflammation, they are not effective against CMV and may even worsen the infection.

B. Obtain aqueous and vitreous samples for polymerase chain reaction/culture/cytology: This choice is incorrect because it is not necessary to perform PCR/culture/cytology on aqueous and vitreous samples in this case. The patient has a history of CMV retinitis in the contralateral eye, and the current symptoms and examination findings are consistent with CMV retinitis. Additionally, obtaining aqueous and vitreous samples may not provide a definitive diagnosis, and the patient's condition may worsen while waiting for the results.

C. Inject intravitreous voriconazole: This choice is incorrect because voriconazole is an antifungal medication, and there is no evidence of fungal infection in this case. While voriconazole has been used to treat CMV retinitis in some cases, it is not the first-line treatment for this condition.

D. Check serology results for exposure to infectious agents: This choice is correct because it is important to determine whether the patient has been exposed to other infectious agents that may be causing or contributing to the retinitis. CMV retinitis can occur in the setting of HIV infection, and it is important to rule out other opportunistic infections that may be causing the patient's symptoms. Checking serology results can help identify whether the patient has been exposed to other infectious agents, such as toxoplasmosis or tuberculosis, that may require additional treatment.

The correct answer is C. Black-spot poison ivy dermatitis because it matches the symptoms described in the question. Poison ivy dermatitis is a common allergic contact dermatitis caused by urushiol, an oil found in the leaves, stems, and roots of the poison ivy plant. The characteristic black spots on the skin are a result of the urushiol oil penetrating the skin and causing a reaction.

The patient's symptoms of a widespread pruritic rash with facial swelling and black streaks, as well as the history of mild atopic dermatitis, are consistent with poison ivy dermatitis. The linear streaks on the right forearm and the circular, black macules on the ipsilateral biceps and axilla are also typical of poison ivy dermatitis.

**Answer**: D. FFR with adenosine should be remeasured after placing a stent in the distal lesion to better assess the proximal lesion.

The correct answer is D, FFR with adenosine should be remeasured after placing a stent in the distal lesion to better assess the proximal lesion, because the initial FFR measurement showed that the proximal lesion had an FFR value of 0.82, indicating that it was not ischemic. However, after placing a stent in the distal lesion, the FFR measurement should be repeated to assess the effect of the stent on the proximal lesion. This is because the distal lesion may have been causing a "steal" effect, where blood flow to the proximal lesion was being compromised, leading to a false negative FFR reading. By remeasuring FFR with adenosine after stenting the distal lesion, the physician can determine if the proximal lesion is truly non-ischemic or if it still requires a stent.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. The proximal lesion is ischemic while the distal lesion is nonischemic. Only the proximal lesion should have a stent placed.
This choice is incorrect because the initial FFR measurement showed that the proximal lesion was not ischemic (FFR=0.82). Therefore, it is not necessary to place a stent in the proximal lesion.

B. The distal lesion is ischemic while the proximal lesion is nonischemic. Only the distal lesion should have a stent placed.
This choice is incorrect because the initial FFR measurement showed that both lesions were ischemic (FFR=0.43). Therefore, both lesions should have a stent placed.

C. Both lesions are ischemic and should have a stent placed.
This choice is incorrect because it is not necessary to place a stent in the proximal lesion, as it was not ischemic (FFR=0.82).

Therefore, the correct answer is D, FFR with adenosine should be remeasured after placing a stent in the distal les

**Answer**: C. Osteosarcoma

The patient's history of retinoblastoma and previous radiation therapy increases the likelihood of a secondary malignancy. The presence of multinucleated giant cells and bizarre stromal cells on the initial biopsy suggests a malignant neoplasm. The subsequent development of osteoid formation with fine calcifications and severely atypical spindle cells with mitotic figures, as well as osteoid-entrapped, malignant-appearing cells, supports the diagnosis of osteosarcoma.

A. Recurrent olfactory neuroblastoma: Unlikely given the patient's history of retinoblastoma and the absence of neuroblastic cells in the biopsy specimen.

B. Recurrent retinoblastoma: Unlikely given the absence of retinoblastoma cells in the biopsy specimen and the patient's previous treatment for retinoblastoma.

D. Rhabdomyosarcoma: Unlikely given the absence of rhabdomyosarcomatous cells in the biopsy specimen and the patient's history of retinoblastoma, which increases the risk of osteosarcoma.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Osteosarcoma.

**Answer**: C. Cavernous hemangioma

The correct answer is C. Cavernous hemangioma because it is a benign vascular tumor that can occur in the nasal septum. The patient's symptoms of frontal and ethmoid sinus pressure, along with the physical examination findings of a central posterior bulge in the posterior nasal cavity, are consistent with a mass in the anterior nasal septum. The noncontrast CT bone window images show an expansile anterior nasal septum mass with internal matrix mineralization, which is consistent with a cavernous hemangioma. The histopathological image from the nasal cavity mass shows a cavernous hemangioma, which is characterized by dilated blood vessels and a lack of atypical cells, supporting the diagnosis.

A. Chondroma is an incorrect choice because it is a benign cartilaginous tumor that typically occurs in the nasal septum and would not explain the patient's symptoms or the imaging findings.

B. Chondroblastoma is an incorrect choice because it is a rare benign tumor that typically occurs in the nasal septum and would not explain the patient's symptoms or the imaging findings.

D. Low-grade chondrosarcoma is an incorrect choice because it is a malignant tumor that typically occurs in the nasal septum and would not explain the patient's symptoms or the imaging findings. It is also rare and usually occurs in older adults.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and imaging studies, the most likely diagnosis is a cavernous hemangioma.

**Answer**:B. Vascular hamartoma

The patient's symptoms of mouth breathing, snoring, nasal obstruction with hyponasality, and eustachian tube dysfunction, as well as transient upper extremity paraplegias, are consistent with a retropharyngeal mass. The fact that the mass has recurred after a debulking procedure and has grown slowly over time suggests that it is a benign tumor.

The patient's history of a benign retropharyngeal mass, along with the MRI findings of a heterogeneously hyperenhancing mass centered at the atlantoaxial joint, eroding the upper dens, anterior arch of C1, and the basion, are consistent with a vascular hamartoma. Vascular hamartomas are benign tumors that are composed of abnormal blood vessels and can occur in various locations, including the head and neck. They can cause symptoms due to their size and location, and can recur after incomplete resection.

Hemangioma (choice A) is a benign tumor of blood vessels, but it typically appears as a well-circumscribed, homogeneous mass on MRI, rather than a heterogeneously hyperenhancing mass.

Chordoma (choice C) is a malignant tumor that arises from the notochord and typically affects the skull base and spine. It can cause symptoms due to its size and location, but it is not typically associated with a history of a benign retropharyngeal mass or recurrence after debulking.

Atypical meningioma (choice D) is a type of meningioma that is not typical in its location, size, or appearance. It can cause symptoms due to its size and location, but it is not typically associated with a history of a benign retropharyngeal mass or recurrence after debulking.

Therefore, based on the patient's history, symptoms, and MRI findings, the most likely diagnosis is vascular hamartoma.

**Answer**:B. Aggressive cholesteatoma

The patient's symptoms and imaging findings are consistent with aggressive cholesteatoma. Cholesteatoma is a benign growth of skin cells in the middle ear, which can cause ear discharge, hearing loss, and mastoiditis. Aggressive cholesteatoma is a rare and severe form of the condition that can invade surrounding tissues and cause meningitis, as seen in this case.

The imaging findings support the diagnosis of aggressive cholesteatoma. The CT scan shows involvement of the middle ear, mastoid, and infralabyrinthine region, which is consistent with cholesteatoma. The gadolinium-enhanced MRI shows meningitis and a large cerebellar lesion with rim enhancement, which suggests that the cholesteatoma has spread to the brain. The diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps are consistent with cerebellar abscess, which is a common complication of aggressive cholesteatoma.

The other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and imaging findings. Complicated acute otitis media (choice A) may cause ear discharge and mastoiditis, but it would not explain the meningitis or cerebellar lesion seen on imaging. Metastatic disease (choice C) is a possibility, but it would be unusual for a metastatic lesion to cause meningitis and cerebellar abscess. Endolymphatic sac tumor (choice D) is a rare condition that can cause meningitis and cerebellar lesions, but it would not explain the middle ear and mastoid involvement seen on imaging.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is aggressive cholesteatoma.

**Answer**: B. Aneurysmal bone cyst

The patient's symptoms of progressive left-sided facial palsy, ipsilateral hearing loss, and decreased facial sensation, along with the physical examination findings of left House-Brackmann grade III/VI facial palsy, hypoesthesia in left trigeminal nerve distribution, and no left audiologic responses to bone or air stimuli, are consistent with a lesion involving the internal auditory canal.

The non-contrast-enhanced CT scan showed a left petrous apex expansile lesion involving the internal auditory canal, which is consistent with an aneurysmal bone cyst. The fluid-fluid level in the lesion and the displacement of the adjacent cranial nerve V are also consistent with this diagnosis.

Aneurysmal bone cysts are benign, blood-filled cavities that can occur in the bones of the skull base, including the petrous apex. They are thought to arise from abnormalities in the development of the blood vessels in the bone.

The other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.

Cholesterol granuloma (choice A) is a benign lesion that can occur in the middle ear and mastoid air cells, but it is not typically associated with facial palsy or hearing loss.

Endolymphatic sac tumor (choice C) is a rare benign tumor that arises from the endolymphatic sac, which is a structure in the inner ear that produces endolymph, the fluid that fills the inner ear. However, this tumor typically presents with symptoms of hearing loss, tinnitus, and balance difficulties, rather than facial palsy.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (choice D) is a rare disorder that occurs when Langerhans cells, a type of immune cell, accumulate in the tissues and form lesions. It can affect various parts of the body, including the skull base, but it is not typically associated with facial palsy or hearing loss.

**Answer**:C. Primary lymphoma of bone

The patient's symptoms of progressive left leg pain, difficulty weight bearing, and ambulating up and down stairs, along with the absence of fever, unintentional weight loss, fatigue, or change in appetite, are consistent with a primary bone lymphoma. The laboratory results, including a hemoglobin level of 10.3 g/dL and a lactic acid dehydrogenase level of 599 u/L, suggest a possible diagnosis of lymphoma. The plain radiograph of the left femur showed a 15-cm area of moderate destruction in the proximal femoral shaft extending distally from the level of the lesser trochanter, which is consistent with a primary bone lymphoma. The patient's history of multiple joint replacements related to osteoarthritis increases the likelihood of a primary bone lymphoma.

The patient's age and medical history also increase the likelihood of a primary bone lymphoma. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not support the diagnosis of fibrosarcoma, solitary plasmacytoma of bone, or fibrous dysplasia.

Fibrosarcoma is a malignant tumor that arises from the soft tissue of the body, such as muscles, tendons, and ligaments. It typically affects the long bones of the extremities and is rare in the proximal femur. Solitary plasmacytoma of bone is a rare type of plasma cell dyscrasia that is usually found in the spine, pelvis, or proximal long bones. It typically presents with pain and/or weakness in the affected area, but the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not support this diagnosis.

Fibrous dysplasia is a benign condition that affects the bone and causes the replacement of normal bone tissue with fibrous tissue. It typically presents with painless swelling or deformity of the affected bone, and the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not support this diagnosis.

The correct answer is B. Obtain trace element levels.

The patient's symptoms of a desquamating rash on his face, scalp, inguinal region, and perineum, accompanied by diffuse alopecia, suggest a possible diagnosis of a trace element deficiency. The patient's history of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, surgical resection, and long-term use of total parenteral nutrition (TPN) increase the likelihood of a trace element deficiency.

Option A, Perform skin biopsy, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis, but it is not the most appropriate next step. A skin biopsy would provide a tissue sample for histopathological examination, but it would not directly assess trace element levels.

Option C, Prescribe topical steroid cream, may help alleviate symptoms, but it would not address the underlying cause of the rash. Topical steroids are commonly used to treat inflammatory skin conditions, but they are not effective in treating trace element deficiencies.

Option D, Order a paraneoplastic panel, may be appropriate if the patient had a history of cancer, but it is not directly related to the patient's current symptoms. A paraneoplastic panel is a group of tests used to detect autoantibodies associated with certain types of cancer, such as lung, breast, or ovarian cancer.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to obtain trace element levels to determine if a deficiency is present and guide further management.

**Answer**:A. The patient has a low-normal serum erythropoietin level. She should be tested for JAK2V16F mutation status.

Explanation:
The patient's low-normal serum erythropoietin level suggests that she may have a condition that increases her red blood cell production, such as polycythemia vera (PV). PV is a myeloproliferative neoplasm that is characterized by the overproduction of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The JAK2V16F mutation is a genetic alteration that is commonly found in patients with PV. Testing the patient for this mutation can help confirm the diagnosis of PV.

Choice B is incorrect because while familial polycythemia is a possibility, it is less likely given the patient's age and the absence of a family history of blood disorders. Additionally, familial polycythemia is typically associated with a high serum erythropoietin level, which is not consistent with the patient's low-normal level.

Choice C is incorrect because while secondary causes of elevated hematocrit levels, such as dehydration or chronic hypoxia, should be considered, the patient's low-normal erythropoietin level suggests a more likely diagnosis of PV.

Choice D is incorrect because while dehydration can cause an elevated hematocrit level, it is unlikely in this case given the patient's symptoms of night sweats and fatigue, which are not typically associated with dehydration. Additionally, the patient's low-normal erythropoietin level suggests a more likely diagnosis of PV.

The correct answer is C. Order active rewarming.

The patient's presentation of being unresponsive, cold to the touch, and having a low blood pressure and heart rate suggests that they may be experiencing hypothermia. Hypothermia is a medical emergency that requires prompt treatment, as it can lead to cardiac arrhythmias, seizures, and even death if left untreated.

Active rewarming is the appropriate next step in managing this patient's hypothermia. It involves using a warm water bath, warm blankets, or other methods to actively warm the patient's body. This helps to increase the patient's core temperature, which can help to improve their cardiac function and prevent further complications.

The other answer choices are not appropriate for this patient's presentation.

A. Order an emergency coronary angiogram: This would not be appropriate for this patient's presentation, as there is no evidence of acute coronary syndrome or any other cardiac condition that would require an emergency angiogram.

B. Order urgent temporary transvenous pacemaker placement: This would not be appropriate for this patient's presentation, as there is no evidence of a cardiac arrhythmia or any other indication for a temporary pacemaker.

D. Order urgent hemodialysis: This would not be appropriate for this patient's presentation, as there is no evidence of acute kidney injury or any other indication for hemodialysis.

**Answer**: B. IgG4-related skin disease

The correct answer is B. IgG4-related skin disease because it most closely matches the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

The patient's history of recurrent erythematous papules and plaques on the cheeks, without any additional symptoms, and the absence of any other autoimmune diseases, are consistent with IgG4-related skin disease. The patient's age, gender, and the location of the lesions also match the typical demographic and clinical presentation of IgG4-related skin disease.

The laboratory results support this diagnosis, as the patient's serum protein electrophoresis revealed polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia, which is a common finding in IgG4-related diseases. Additionally, the absence of antinuclear antibody and anti-Ro/SS-A and anti-La/SS-B antibodies, which are commonly seen in autoimmune diseases such as Sjögren syndrome, further supports the diagnosis of IgG4-related skin disease.

The skin biopsy findings also support this diagnosis, as the nodular inflammatory cell infiltration consisting of dense lymphocytes admixed with plasma cells and eosinophils, and the positive staining for IgG4, are consistent with the histopathologic features of IgG4-related skin disease.

In contrast, the other answer choices do not match the patient's symptoms and laboratory results as closely:

A. Sarcoidosis: This diagnosis is unlikely given the absence of any other symptoms, such as respiratory or ocular involvement, and the lack of any granulomas or asteroid bodies on the skin biopsy.

C. Cutaneous lymphoma: This diagnosis is unlikely given the absence of any other symptoms, such as fever, night sweats, or weight loss, and the lack of any evidence of malignancy on the skin biopsy.

D. Sjögren syndrome: This diagnosis is unlikely given the absence of any other symptoms, such as dry mouth or dry eyes, and the lack of any evidence of autoimmune disease on the laboratory results.

**Answer**: C. Leukemia cutis with leukemic vasculitis

Explanation:
The correct diagnosis is leukemia cutis with leukemic vasculitis (choice C) because the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with this diagnosis. Leukemia cutis is a rare complication of leukemia that occurs when leukemic cells infiltrate the skin, leading to the formation of skin lesions. In this case, the patient's skin lesions, including tender purpuric papules and plaques with central necrosis on the scalp, right dorsal hand, and left lower leg, are consistent with leukemia cutis. The patient's history of AML, status post–nonallogenic bone marrow transplant and subsequent relapse, and the presence of myeloid blasts in her peripheral blood that express CD13, CD33, CD117, and partial CD11b, are also consistent with leukemia cutis.

The presence of leukemic vasculitis, which is characterized by the infiltration of leukemic cells into blood vessels, further supports the diagnosis of leukemia cutis with leukemic vasculitis. The patient's symptoms of tender lesions and the presence of hemorrhagic crusting on the scalp are consistent with leukemic vasculitis. The negative results of wound cultures and polymerase chain reaction studies for herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus infections also support this diagnosis, as leukemic vasculitis is not typically associated with viral infections.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (choice A): While disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a potential complication of AML, it is not the most likely diagnosis in this case.

**Answer**:C. Phaeohyphomycosis

The patient's history of immunosuppression and the presence of chronic kidney disease increase the likelihood of fungal infections. The physical examination findings of friable, growing lesions on the elbow, as well as the histopathological features described in the question, are consistent with phaeohyphomycosis.

Phaeohyphomycosis is a type of fungal infection caused by dematiaceous fungi, which are characterized by the presence of melanin in their cell walls. The infection typically affects the skin and subcutaneous tissues, and can cause a variety of clinical presentations, including nodules, plaques, and ulcers.

The histopathological features described in the question, including pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia of the epidermis with focal ulceration, a mixed inflammatory infiltrate containing neutrophils, plasma cells, histiocytic, and multinucleate giant cells containing refractile spore-like structures, and numerous spores and pseudohyphae staining positively for pigment, are consistent with phaeohyphomycosis.

Aspergillosis (choice A) is a type of fungal infection caused by Aspergillus species. While Aspergillus can cause a variety of infections, including skin infections, the histopathological features described in the question are not typical of Aspergillus infections.

Mucormycosis (choice B) is a type of fungal infection caused by Mucorales, which are also known as zygomycetes. Mucormycosis typically affects the sinuses, brain, and lungs, and can cause skin infections in rare cases. The histopathological features described in the question are not typical of Mucormycosis.

**Answer**:C. Order brain magnetic resonance imaging
The patient's symptoms of sudden severe headache, decreased hearing bilaterally, and visual disturbances suggest a possible diagnosis of a central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis, which can cause bilateral visual disturbances, hearing loss, and headaches. The presence of retinal artery occlusion and whitening of an arteriole on fundus examination also supports this diagnosis.

C. Order brain magnetic resonance imaging: This choice is correct because MRI is the most appropriate imaging modality to evaluate the brain and its blood vessels, particularly in the setting of suspected CNS vasculitis. MRI can help identify any inflammation, infarction, or other abnormalities in the brain tissue and its blood vessels, which can guide further management and treatment.

A. Consult otolaryngology for hearing evaluation: While hearing evaluation is an appropriate step in the management of hearing loss, it is not the most urgent step in this scenario. The patient's sudden severe headache and visual disturbances suggest a more urgent need for neuroimaging to rule out any intracranial pathology.

B. Order an echocardiogram: An echocardiogram may be useful in evaluating for potential cardiac sources of emboli, but it is not the most appropriate step in this scenario. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a more likely diagnosis of CNS vasculitis, which would not be evaluated by an echocardiogram.

D. Order carotid ultrasonography: Carotid ultrasonography may be useful in evaluating for potential carotid artery disease, but it is not the most appropriate step in this scenario. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a more likely diagnosis of CNS vasculitis, which would not be evaluated by carotid ultrasonography.

**Answer**:C. Fluorescein angiography and workup for infectious and inflammatory etiologies

The patient's symptoms of flashes and floaters, combined with the presence of vitreous cells and a peripheral retinal lesion, suggest a possible inflammatory or infectious etiology. Fluorescein angiography would help to evaluate the retinal circulation and identify any areas of inflammation or leakage. Additionally, workup for infectious and inflammatory etiologies, such as laboratory tests and imaging studies, would help to determine the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

Option A is incorrect because, although the patient's symptoms may be related to her prior posterior vitreous detachment, the presence of vitreous cells and a peripheral retinal lesion suggest a more urgent evaluation is needed to rule out an infectious or inflammatory process.

Option B is incorrect because, although a cardiology consultation may be appropriate to evaluate for potential sources of emboli, it would not address the patient's current symptoms or the abnormalities seen on examination.

Option D is incorrect because, although oral prednisone may be used to treat inflammatory conditions, it would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and would not be appropriate without further diagnostic testing to determine the etiology of the patient's condition.

The correct answer is C. Excise the affected conjunctiva.

The patient's symptoms of redness, foreign body sensation, and tearing in the left eye, along with the physical examination findings of discrete papules with dark centers on the extremities and trunk, are consistent with a diagnosis of conjunctival hyperemia and targetoid lesions. The presence of a similar lesion on the patient's wife's arm suggests a possible allergic or environmental cause.

Excision of the affected conjunctiva (choice C) is the appropriate next step in management, as it will allow for a definitive diagnosis and removal of the causative agent, if present. This approach is supported by the fact that the patient's symptoms are localized to the left eye and are not accompanied by any systemic symptoms, suggesting a localized rather than a systemic process.

In contrast, starting systemic and topical antibiotics (choice A) may not be effective in treating the underlying cause of the conjunctival hyperemia and targetoid lesions, as there is no evidence of an active infection. Moreover, this approach may mask the symptoms and delay a definitive diagnosis.

Removing the foreign body with forceps (choice B) may be necessary if the patient has a visible foreign body in the conjunctiva, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a more widespread process.

Performing a computed tomographic scan of the orbits (choice D) may be considered in cases of orbital cellulitis or other orbital processes, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest an orbital process.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Excise the affected conjunctiva.

**Answer**:B. Measure vitamin levels, including vitamin A (retinol)

The correct answer is B. Measure vitamin levels, including vitamin A (retinol), because the patient's symptoms of bilateral conjunctival lesions, decreased vision, and diffuse punctate keratopathy are suggestive of a vitamin deficiency, specifically vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A plays a crucial role in the health of the conjunctiva and cornea, and deficiency can lead to conjunctival lesions and vision impairment. Measuring vitamin levels, including vitamin A, can help diagnose a deficiency and guide treatment.

Option A, ordering anti-Ro and anti-La antibody testing, is not relevant to the patient's symptoms and is not the next step in management. Anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies are associated with autoimmune diseases, such as Sjögren's syndrome, but there is no indication of such a condition in this patient.

Option C, biopsy lesions to rule out malignancy or premalignancy, may be considered later in management if the lesions are suspicious for cancer, but it is not the next step based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings.

Option D, asking the patient if she is taking any antibiotics or anticonvulsants, is not relevant to the patient's symptoms and is not the next step in management. The patient's history of a recent weight loss procedure suggests that she may have been taking anticonvulsants, but this information is not provided in the scenario.

**Answer**: C. Jejunogastric intussusception

The correct answer is C. Jejunogastric intussusception because it aligns with the patient's symptoms and imaging results.

Intussusception is a condition where a portion of the intestine telescopes into another section, causing a blockage. Jejunogastric intussusception specifically refers to a telescoping of the jejunum into the stomach. The patient's symptoms of sudden-onset upper abdominal pain and vomiting for 7 days are consistent with this condition.

The imaging results also support this diagnosis. The contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed a mass in the stomach, which could indicate the presence of an intussusception. Additionally, the patient's history of gastric surgery more than 25 years ago increases the likelihood of this diagnosis, as intussusception can be a complication of previous abdominal surgery.

Now, let's discuss why the other answer choices are incorrect:

A. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST): A GIST is a type of tumor that occurs in the digestive system. While it's possible that the patient could have a GIST, the imaging results and symptoms don't strongly suggest this diagnosis. The patient's symptoms are more consistent with an intussusception, and the CT scan doesn't show any characteristics of a GIST.

B. Gastric bezoar: A bezoar is a mass that forms in the stomach, typically composed of food or other foreign material. While a bezoar can cause abdominal pain and vomiting, it's unlikely to cause a telescoping of the intestine, which is a key feature of intussusception. Additionally, the patient's history of gastric surgery makes it less likely that a bezoar is the cause.

**Answer**: C. Primary hyperparathyroidism

The patient's presentation of severe hypercalcemia (elevated serum calcium level of 8.5 mg/dL and 12 mg/dL) and hyperparathyroidism (elevated parathyroid hormone level) is consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism. This diagnosis is further supported by the patient's history of anorexia and malaise, which are common symptoms of hyperparathyroidism. The patient's kidney stones and hydronephrosis are also consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism, as hyperparathyroidism can cause kidney stones and kidney damage.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Hypervitaminosis D: While hypervitaminosis D can cause hypercalcemia, it is not typically associated with hyperparathyroidism. The patient's history and physical examination do not suggest vitamin D toxicity.

B. Malignant neoplasm: While malignant neoplasms can cause hypercalcemia, the patient's age and presentation do not suggest a malignancy. The patient's history of anorexia and malaise is not typical of malignancy.

D. Sarcoidosis: Sarcoidosis can cause hypercalcemia, but it is not typically associated with hyperparathyroidism. The patient's physical examination and laboratory results do not suggest sarcoidosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Primary hyperparathyroidism.

**Answer**:A. Hungry bone syndrome

Hungry bone syndrome, also known as osteitis fibrosa cystica, is a rare endocrine disorder that is characterized by an imbalance in the metabolism of calcium and phosphorus, leading to an excessive release of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and a subsequent increase in bone resorption. The clinical presentation of hungry bone syndrome includes symptoms such as bone pain, muscle weakness, and an increased risk of fractures. Laboratory findings may include hypocalcemia, hyperphosphatemia, and an elevated PTH level.

In this case, the patient presented with symptoms consistent with hypocalcemia, such as muscle tenderness, carpal spasm, and twitching of facial muscles. Laboratory findings confirmed hypocalcemia and an elevated PTH level, which are both consistent with hungry bone syndrome. Additionally, the patient's wrist radiograph showed evidence of bone abnormalities, including widening of the physes of the distal radius and transverse splaying, fraying, and cupping of the adjacent metaphyses, which are also consistent with hungry bone syndrome.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

B. Primary hyperparathyroidism is a disorder characterized by an excessive secretion of PTH from one or more parathyroid glands, leading to hypercalcemia and hyperparathyroidism. While primary hyperparathyroidism can also present with symptoms such as bone pain and muscle weakness, the laboratory findings are distinct from those seen in hungry bone syndrome, with hypercalcemia and an elevated PTH level.

C. Chronic kidney disease is a gradual loss of kidney function over time, leading to the accumulation of waste products in the body. While chronic kidney disease can also cause hypocalcemia, the underlying mechanism is different from that of hungry bone syndrome, and the clinical presentation and laboratory findings are not consistent with this diagnosis.

**Answer**: C. Acute aortic dissection

The correct answer is C. Acute aortic dissection, as it best fits the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

A. Acute viral pericarditis is an unlikely diagnosis, as the patient's symptoms of fever and chest discomfort do not suggest a viral infection. Additionally, the diffuse ST-segment elevation on the electrocardiogram (ECG) is not typical of acute viral pericarditis, which usually presents with a localized ST-segment elevation.

B. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is also an unlikely diagnosis, as the patient's ECG does not show the characteristic changes of AMI, such as ST-segment elevation in a specific lead or leads. Furthermore, the patient's history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease (CKD) increases the likelihood of a cardiovascular event, but the absence of cardiac enzymes and the presence of a normal ejection fraction on the echocardiogram make AMI less likely.

D. Pericardial tumor is a possible diagnosis, but it is less likely than acute aortic dissection, given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results. The patient's fever and chest discomfort could be due to a pericardial effusion caused by the tumor, but the diffuse ST-segment elevation on the ECG is not typical of a pericardial tumor. Additionally, the patient's history of hypertension and CKD increases the likelihood of a cardiovascular event.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, laboratory results, and ECG findings, the most likely diagnosis is acute aortic dissection. This diagnosis is supported by the patient's chest pain, fever, and elevated C-reactive protein level, which are all consistent with an inflammatory response in the aortic wall. The diffuse ST-segment elevation on the ECG is also consistent with this diagnosis, as it suggests a widespread injury to the myocardium due to a decrease in blood flow caused by the dissection.

**Answer**:C. Gardner syndrome
The patient's symptoms, such as headache, periorbital edema, and pain, as well as the physical examination findings of left orbital swelling and erythema with proptosis, are consistent with Gardner syndrome. Gardner syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple osteomas, which are benign bone tumors, and other symptoms such as headaches, facial swelling, and pain. The patient's family history, with a similar presentation involving his mother, also supports this diagnosis.

The other choices are not correct for the following reasons:

A. Gorlin syndrome, also known as nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple basal cell carcinomas and other symptoms such as skeletal abnormalities, intellectual disability, and facial dysmorphism. While it can present with headaches and facial swelling, it does not typically present with osteomas.

B. Turcot syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple osteomas and other symptoms such as intellectual disability, seizures, and facial dysmorphism. However, it is typically associated with a different genetic mutation than Gardner syndrome.

D. Turner syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects females and is characterized by short stature, infertility, and other symptoms. While it can present with headaches and facial swelling, it does not typically present with osteomas.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and family history, Gardner syndrome is the most likely diagnosis.

**Answer**: C. Laryngeal schwannoma

The correct answer is C. Laryngeal schwannoma because it matches the patient's symptoms and test results. A schwannoma is a benign tumor that originates from the supporting cells of the nervous system, called Schwann cells.

The patient's symptoms of a globus sensation in the throat and throat pain, along with the physical examination findings of a submucosal swelling in the right aryepiglottic fold and compression of the airway, are consistent with a laryngeal schwannoma. The patient's history of smoking and hypertension may also increase the risk of developing a schwannoma.

The CT scan and MRI results also support this diagnosis, as they show a submucosal mass that is compressing the airway and deviating the aryepiglottic fold medially. The fact that the mass was completely excised and the patient had an uneventful postoperative course also suggests that the tumor was benign, which is consistent with a schwannoma.

The other answer choices do not match the patient's symptoms and test results as well.

A. Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that arises from the squamous cells that line the larynx. While it is possible for squamous cell carcinoma to present with symptoms similar to those of a schwannoma, such as throat pain and dysphagia, the presence of a submucosal mass and compression of the airway are less typical for squamous cell carcinoma. Additionally, the patient's history of smoking and hypertension would increase the risk of squamous cell carcinoma, but they do not necessarily point to this diagnosis.

B. Laryngeal neurofibroma is a benign tumor that originates from the nerve sheath. While it can cause symptoms such as throat pain and dysphagia, it is less likely to cause a submucosal mass or compress the airway. Additionally, the patient's history of smoking and hypertension would not necessarily

**Answer**: C. Primary laryngotracheobronchial amyloidosis

The correct answer is C, Primary laryngotracheobronchial amyloidosis, because it best fits the patient's symptoms and findings.

A, Endobronchial sarcoidosis, is an inflammatory disease that affects the lungs and lymph nodes, but it does not typically cause calcified nodules or masses in the airways.

B, Granulomatosis with polyangiitis, is a systemic vasculitis that can affect the respiratory system, but it typically presents with symptoms such as hemoptysis, cough, and chest pain, and the nodules or masses are usually not calcified.

D, Tracheobronchial osteochondropathia, is a rare condition that affects the cartilage and bone of the trachea and bronchi, but it does not typically cause calcified nodules or masses.

Primary laryngotracheobronchial amyloidosis, on the other hand, is a rare condition that affects the respiratory system, particularly the larynx, trachea, and bronchi. It is characterized by the deposition of amyloid material in the airways, which can cause symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, and wheezing, as well as nodules or masses in the airways. The patient's symptoms of progressive dyspnea and nonproductive cough, as well as the findings of calcified nodules and masses in the airways, are consistent with primary laryngotracheobronchial amyloidosis. The patient's history of hypertension and diabetes may also be relevant to the patient's overall health and potential treatment plan, but they are not directly related to the patient's primary diagnosis.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and findings, the most likely diagnosis is primary laryngotracheobronchial amyloidosis, which is why choice C is the correct answer.

**Answer**: D. Reaction to radiotherapy

The correct answer is D. Reaction to radiotherapy because the patient's symptoms of pruritic pustules and papules on the skin of the ipsilateral right breast, which developed two months after the last dose of radiation, are consistent with a radiation-induced skin reaction. The patient's history of a cold sore several years ago also suggests that she may have a pre-existing condition that has been exacerbated by the radiation therapy.

Option A, Bacterial folliculitis, is unlikely because the patient does not have a history of recent skin trauma or infection, and the pustules are not typical of bacterial folliculitis.

Option B, Herpes infection, is also unlikely because the patient does not have a history of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, and the pustules do not have the characteristic appearance of HSV lesions.

Option C, Pityrosporum folliculitis, is a type of fungal infection that can cause folliculitis, but it is unlikely in this case because the patient does not have a history of using topical corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications, which are common risk factors for Pityrosporum folliculitis.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is D. Reaction to radiotherapy, which is a known side effect of radiation therapy, especially in breast cancer patients. The patient's symptoms and history are consistent with this diagnosis, and it is the most appropriate answer choice.

**Answer**:B. Myeloid sarcoma

The patient's symptoms and test results indicate that they have myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a type of cancer that affects the bone marrow and blood. The patient has a history of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, and a bone marrow biopsy showed refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia. These are all consistent with MDS.

The patient also reports fatigue and has a polypoid mass on the right upper labial mucosa that has recently increased in size. This mass is consistent with myeloid sarcoma, a rare complication of MDS that occurs when myeloid cells become cancerous and form a tumor outside of the bone marrow. Myeloid sarcoma can present with a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, fever, and weight loss, and can affect various parts of the body, including the skin and mucous membranes.

The other answer choices are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and test results. Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that is not related to MDS or myeloid sarcoma. Invasive aspergilloma is a type of fungal infection that can affect the sinuses, lungs, and other parts of the body, but it is not related to MDS or myeloid sarcoma. Condyloma acuminatum is a type of genital wart that is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), and is not related to MDS or myeloid sarcoma.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Myeloid sarcoma.

The correct answer is D. Discontinue doxycycline and restart topical antifungal cream.

Let's examine each answer choice in detail:

A. Complete 14 days of antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease. No further testing is indicated.

This choice is incorrect because the patient's symptoms have already resolved with the use of topical antifungal cream, and there is no indication of active Lyme disease. Therefore, completing a full 14-day course of antibiotics may not be necessary, and may even cause harm by exposing the patient to potential side effects.

B. Complete 14 days of antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease. Repeat Lyme disease serology in 1 month to evaluate response.

This choice is also incorrect for the same reason as A. The patient's symptoms have already resolved, and there is no indication of active Lyme disease. Repeating Lyme disease serology in 1 month may not provide any useful information and may lead to unnecessary testing and treatment.

C. Obtain skin biopsy for Borrelia burgdorferi PCR.

This choice is incorrect because the patient's symptoms have already resolved, and there is no indication of active Lyme disease. Performing a skin biopsy would not provide any useful information and may cause unnecessary discomfort and risk to the patient.

Therefore, the best answer is D. Discontinue doxycycline and restart topical antifungal cream. This choice acknowledges that the patient's symptoms have already resolved with the use of topical antifungal cream and avoids unnecessary antibiotic treatment. It also takes into account the possibility that the patient's symptoms may have been caused by a fungal infection, rather than Lyme disease.

**Answer**:B. Obtain serum MMA levels

Explanation:
The patient's presentation of pancytopenia, with a low reticulocyte count and normal vitamin B12 and folate levels, suggests a diagnosis of megaloblastic anemia. This, combined with the patient's history of hypothyroidism, suggests that the anemia is likely due to a deficiency in vitamin B12.

Vitamin B12 is essential for the production of red blood cells, and deficiency can lead to megaloblastic anemia, characterized by the production of large, immature red blood cells (megaloblasts). The presence of macrocytes and teardrop cells on the peripheral blood smear, as well as the bone marrow biopsy findings of erythroid hyperplasia with megaloblastic changes, further support this diagnosis.

Obtaining serum MMA levels (choice B) is the most appropriate next step, as MMA is a metabolite of vitamin B12 and its levels can help confirm the diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency. Elevated MMA levels indicate a deficiency in vitamin B12, as the body is unable to properly metabolize this vitamin.

Increasing the levothyroxine dose (choice A) may help address the patient's hypothyroidism, but it will not address the underlying vitamin B12 deficiency causing the pancytopenia.

Obtaining a computed tomography scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to evaluate for lymphadenopathy (choice C) may be appropriate in the workup of a patient with pancytopenia, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as the patient's history and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency.

Send parvovirus B19 serologies and polymerase chain reaction for viral DNA (choice D) is not relevant to the patient's current presentation and should not be ordered at this time. While parvovirus B19 infection can cause pancytopenia, the patient's history and laboratory results do not

**Answer**:B. Obtain serum liver function tests, lipase level, and ophthalmologic evaluation; monitor for multiorgan damage

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a systemic inflammatory response, possibly related to the recent coronary angiography and coronary artery bypass graft surgery. The blue discoloration of the toes and red macules on the hands are concerning for a vasculitic process, which could be caused by a number of factors, including infection, autoimmune disorders, or adverse reactions to medications. The patient's history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and mild aortic stenosis increases the likelihood of a cardiovascular etiology.

Option B is the correct answer because it addresses the patient's multiorgan involvement and potential systemic inflammatory response. Obtaining serum liver function tests, lipase level, and ophthalmologic evaluation will help evaluate for potential liver, pancreas, and eye involvement, respectively, which are commonly affected in systemic inflammatory disorders. Additionally, monitoring for multiorgan damage is crucial in this patient population, as they are at risk for developing life-threatening complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, cardiac failure, and renal failure.

Option A, obtaining chest computed tomography angiography, may be necessary to evaluate for pulmonary embolism or other cardiovascular complications, but it does not address the patient's multiorgan involvement or potential systemic inflammatory response.

Option C, obtaining surgical consult for amputation, is not appropriate at this time, as the patient's condition is not severe enough to warrant amputation, and it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

Option D, starting heparin and discussing thrombolytic therapy with the patient, may be appropriate if the patient is diagnosed with a thrombotic or embolic event, but it is not the first step in managing the patient's current symptoms and condition.

**Answer**: D. Alkaptonuria

The patient's symptoms, such as the gradual onset of blue discoloration of the ears, mild knee arthralgia, and conjunctival nevi, are consistent with Alkaptonuria. Alkaptonuria is a rare genetic disorder that affects the production of homogentisic acid, a compound that is normally broken down to produce melanin. When homogentisic acid accumulates in the body, it can cause a bluish-gray discoloration of the skin, particularly in areas exposed to sunlight, such as the ears. The patient's history of mild knee arthralgia is also consistent with Alkaptonuria, as some people with this condition may experience joint pain. The presence of conjunctival nevi, which are benign growths on the conjunctiva, is also a common feature of Alkaptonuria.

Argyria, or silver poisoning, is an incorrect diagnosis because the patient's discoloration is not consistent with the typical silver-gray color associated with argyria. Additionally, there is no history of silver exposure.

Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is also an incorrect diagnosis because the patient's symptoms do not match the typical presentation of AIP, which includes abdominal pain, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and autonomic dysfunction.

Diffuse melanosis in metastatic melanoma is an unlikely diagnosis because the patient's discoloration is not consistent with the typical darkening of the skin associated with melanoma, and there is no evidence of a melanoma tumor.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, the most likely diagnosis is Alkaptonuria.

**Answer**: D. Congenital cutaneous candidiasis

The correct answer is D. Congenital cutaneous candidiasis because it best fits the clinical presentation and laboratory findings described in the case.

Congenital cutaneous candidiasis is a rare condition characterized by the presence of yeast infections on the skin of newborns. It is caused by the vertical transmission of Candida from mother to fetus during pregnancy or childbirth. The clinical presentation of congenital cutaneous candidiasis typically includes the presence of papules, pustules, or vesicles on the skin, which may be distributed widely or localized to specific areas.

In this case, the affected twin had numerous pink papules and vesiculopustules on the trunk, extensor upper arms, and upper legs, which is consistent with the clinical presentation of congenital cutaneous candidiasis. The absence of lesions on the diaper area, hands, feet, nails, and oral mucosa also supports this diagnosis, as these areas are typically spared in cases of congenital cutaneous candidiasis.

The laboratory findings also support this diagnosis. The presence of yeast forms on potassium hydroxide staining and the negative results for bacterial cultures and herpes simplex virus polymerase chain reaction are consistent with the diagnosis of congenital cutaneous candidiasis. Additionally, the fact that the placentas from both neonates were sent for pathologic analysis suggests that the condition was likely caused by a congenital infection.

In contrast, the other answer choices do not fit the clinical presentation and laboratory findings as well.

A. Neonatal candidiasis is a more general term that refers to any type of Candida infection in a neonate. While it is possible that the affected twin had neonatal candidiasis, the presence of cutaneous lesions and the negative cultures for bacteria and herpes simplex virus suggest that congenital cutaneous candidiasis is a more specific and likely diagnosis.

B. Erythema toxicum neonatorum is a common benign condition characterized by the sudden onset of red, papular lesions on the skin of neonates.

**Answer**: A. Galli-Galli disease

Galli-Galli disease, also known as generalized eruptive keratosis, is a rare benign skin condition characterized by the development of numerous small, rough, reddish-brown papules on the skin, particularly on the trunk, arms, and legs. The condition typically affects middle-aged adults, and the lesions can be distributed in a reticulate pattern, which is consistent with the patient's presentation in the case.

The patient's history of a 20-year progression, the presence of hyperkeratotic papules and reticulated hyperpigmentation on the face, neck, chest, back, and extremities, and the absence of nail or mucosal changes, are all consistent with Galli-Galli disease. Additionally, the histopathological findings of hyperorthokeratosis, epidermal acanthosis, and elongated epidermal rete ridges with bud-like filiform projections and suprapapillary plate thinning, are also consistent with Galli-Galli disease.

Grover disease, also known as transient acantholytic dyskeratosis, is a rare, benign skin condition that typically affects middle-aged men. It is characterized by the development of small, scaly, red papules on the skin, particularly on the trunk and extremities. While Grover disease can have a similar appearance to Galli-Galli disease, the reticulate pattern of hyperpigmentation and the absence of nail or mucosal changes are not typical of Grover disease.

Classic Dowling-Degos disease is a rare genetic disorder that affects the skin and mucous membranes. It is characterized by the development of small, flesh-colored or white papules on the skin, particularly on the face, neck, and extremities. While Dowling-Degos disease can have a similar appearance to Galli-Galli disease, the presence of mucosal changes, such as papillomatosis of the mucous membranes, is a distinguishing feature of Dowling-Degos disease.

The correct answer is D. Pars plana vitrectomy with removal of the intraocular lens and capsule.

Let's go through each answer choice and explain why it's incorrect or correct:

A. Restart topical prednisolone acetate and/or ofloxacin eyedrops.

This choice is incorrect because the patient has already been treated with topical steroids and antibiotics, and the inflammation has recurred. Restarting the same treatment may not be effective in managing the chronic inflammation, and may even lead to further complications such as increased intraocular pressure or cataract formation.

B. Repeat vitreous biopsy and intravitreal injection of antibiotics.

This choice is incorrect because the patient has already undergone a vitreous tap, which was negative for organisms. Repeating the same procedure may not provide any new information, and may even increase the risk of complications such as retinal detachment or bleeding. Intravitreal injection of antibiotics may also not be effective in managing the chronic inflammation, as the inflammation may be caused by a non-infectious etiology.

C. Intravitreal and/or posterior sub-Tenon triamcinolone injection.

This choice is incorrect because while corticosteroid injections can be effective in managing inflammation, they may not address the underlying cause of the chronic inflammation. In addition, posterior sub-Tenon triamcinolone injection may not be effective in managing anterior chamber inflammation.

D. Pars plana vitrectomy with removal of the intraocular lens and capsule.

This choice is correct because it addresses the underlying cause of the chronic inflammation, which is likely related to the presence of the intraocular lens and capsule. Removing the lens and capsule can help to eliminate the source of inflammation and prevent further recurrences. Additionally, pars plana vitrectomy can help to remove any residual inflammatory cells and tissue in the vitreous cavity, further reducing the risk of

**Answer**:C. Perform laser iridotomy or iridoplasty

The patient's symptoms of severe eye pain, headache, and acute increase in intraocular pressure (IOP) suggest that the Baerveldt drainage implant is occluded. The high-resolution ultrasonography image shows that the lumen of the tube is occluded, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms.

Option A, applying digital pressure over the plate to dislodge the obstruction, may be effective in some cases, but it is not the most appropriate choice in this situation. The occlusion is likely due to a blockage in the tube, rather than a blockage on the plate. Applying pressure to the plate may not effectively dislodge the blockage in the tube.

Option B, repositioning the tube, may be necessary in some cases, but it is not the most appropriate choice in this situation. The patient's symptoms and the ultrasonography image suggest that the tube is properly positioned in the sulcus. Repositioning the tube may not address the underlying cause of the occlusion.

Option D, performing vitrectomy, may be necessary in some cases, but it is not the most appropriate choice in this situation. Vitrectomy is a more invasive procedure that involves removing the vitreous gel and may be necessary if the occlusion is due to a vitreous blockage. However, in this case, the occlusion is likely due to a blockage in the tube, and vitrectomy may not be necessary.

Option C, performing laser iridotomy or iridoplasty, is the most appropriate choice in this situation. Laser iridotomy or iridoplasty can be used to create a hole in the iris, which can help to relieve the pressure caused by the blockage in the tube. This procedure is less invasive than vitrectomy and can be performed in the clinic. It is the most appropriate choice to treat the patient's symptoms and relieve the pressure caused by the occlusion.

**Answer**:B. Refer for genetic counseling and potential testing for an NR2E3 mutation

The patient's symptoms and test results indicate that she has retinal changes in both eyes, including poor foveal light reflexes, an annular pattern of outer retinal hypopigmentation, and inferotemporal clumped pigment deposits. Additionally, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) shows outer retinal foveoschisis and outer retinal thinning with interruptions in the ellipsoid in the peripheral macula. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of retinal dystrophy, specifically retinitis pigmentosa (RP).

RP is a group of inherited retinal diseases that can cause progressive vision loss. The patient's family history, with no reported visual difficulties in family members, suggests that this may be a sporadic case of RP. However, it is still possible that the patient has an underlying genetic mutation that has not been identified.

Therefore, the best course of action would be to refer the patient for genetic counseling and potential testing for an NR2E3 mutation. NR2E3 is a gene that has been associated with RP, and identifying a mutation in this gene could help to confirm the diagnosis and guide future management.

The other options are not as appropriate for several reasons:

* Option A, performing an intravitreous injection of an anti–vascular endothelial growth factor, is not indicated for the patient's current symptoms and test results. While anti-VEGF injections can be useful for treating certain retinal conditions, such as age-related macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy, they are not typically used for RP.
* Option C, ordering testing for antirecoverin antibodies, is not relevant to the patient's symptoms or suspected diagnosis. Antirecoverin antibodies are associated with a different retinal condition called autoimmune retinopathy.
* Option D, performing a vitreous biopsy, is not necessary at this time. While a vitreous biopsy can provide valuable information in certain cases, it is not typically performed for

**Answer**: C. Obtain serum chemistry with radiographs of the extremities

The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a systemic condition that may be contributing to the macular edema and neurosensory detachment. The patient's age, fatigue, muscle stiffness, joint pain, and unintentional weight loss suggest a possible underlying autoimmune or inflammatory disorder. The bilateral microaneurysms and dot hemorrhages on fundus examination also support this possibility.

Option C, obtaining serum chemistry with radiographs of the extremities, is the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation. This will help to identify any underlying systemic conditions that may be contributing to the patient's ocular findings. Serum chemistry tests can help to identify abnormalities in lipid metabolism, electrolyte imbalances, and renal or hepatic dysfunction, among other conditions. Radiographs of the extremities can help to identify any evidence of inflammation or infection in the joints or bones.

Option A, administering an intravitreous anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agent in the left eye, may be appropriate in the future, but it is not the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation. While anti-VEGF therapy can be effective in treating macular edema, it is important to identify and address any underlying systemic conditions that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms.

Option B, obtaining neuroimaging of the brain and orbits, may also be appropriate in the future, but it is not the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation. While neuroimaging can help to identify any intracranial or orbital abnormalities that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms, it is not necessary at this time.

**Answer**: B. Pseudomonas aeruginosa

The correct answer is B. Pseudomonas aeruginosa because it is a bacterial infection that can cause purpura and septic shock in children. The patient's symptoms, including the rapid progression of purpuric lesions and the absence of pus, are consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's recent vaccination with the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine, which contains a live attenuated virus, may have compromised her immune system and increased her susceptibility to bacterial infection.

Here's why the other answer choices are incorrect:

A. Herpes simplex virus: While herpes simplex virus can cause ulcers and skin lesions, it is not typically associated with purpura or septic shock. Additionally, the patient's recent vaccination with the measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine would have provided some protection against herpes simplex virus.

C. Streptococcus pyogenes: Streptococcus pyogenes can cause skin infections and septic shock, but it is not typically associated with purpura. Additionally, the patient's throat culture was negative, which suggests that a streptococcal infection is less likely.

D. Neisseria meningitidis: Neisseria meningitidis can cause septic shock and purpura, but it is typically associated with meningitis and other invasive infections. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not suggest meningitis or another invasive infection.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is B. Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

**Answer**: D. Perform cardiac magnetic resonance imaging to define pathologic substrate

**Explanation**:
The correct answer is D, Perform cardiac magnetic resonance imaging to define pathologic substrate, because it is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's condition.

The patient has been experiencing recurrent episodes of palpitations for 6 consecutive years, and the resting 12-lead electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with no preexcitation or repolarization abnormalities. However, there were incessant multiple runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia with right bundle branch block morphologic features, suggesting a possible ventricular arrhythmia originating from the left ventricular apical region.

Option A, Map and ablate the epicardium, is not the most appropriate next step because while it may be a consideration in the future, it is not necessary at this point in the patient's management. The patient has not had a thorough evaluation of the underlying substrate, and ablation without a clear understanding of the arrhythmia's origin and mechanism may not be effective.

Option B, Add a second antiarrhythmic drug and reassess the need for epicardial intervention after 3 to 6 months, may be a reasonable approach, but it is not the most appropriate next step. The patient has already been prescribed sotalol, and if the arrhythmia persists, adding another antiarrhythmic drug may not be effective. Moreover, the patient's symptoms have persisted for 6 years, and it is essential to define the pathologic substrate to determine the best course of action.

Option C, Implant a cardioverter defibrillator, is not the most appropriate next step because the patient does not have a history of life-threatening arrhythmias, and there is no indication for an implantable device at this time.

Therefore, the correct answer is D, Perform cardiac magnetic resonance imaging to define pathologic substrate. This will provide valuable information on the structural and functional aspects of the heart, which will help guide further management decisions, including the possibility of epicardial intervention.

**Answer**:B. Fibrous dysplasia

B. Fibrous dysplasia is the correct answer because it is a benign bone disorder that can cause a lesion in the otic capsule, as described in the patient's symptoms and imaging results. Fibrous dysplasia is characterized by the proliferation of fibrous tissue in the bone, leading to the formation of a lesion that can cause bone expansion and erosion of surrounding structures. The patient's symptoms of gradual-onset hearing loss, whistling tinnitus, and sharp otalgia, as well as the imaging findings of a expansile ground-glass density lesion arising within the lateral aspect of the otic capsule, are consistent with fibrous dysplasia.

A. Paget disease is an incorrect choice because it is a condition that affects the bone metabolism and causes abnormal bone remodeling, leading to deformity and pain. Although it can cause hearing loss, it is not typically associated with otic capsule lesions.

C. Exostosis is an incorrect choice because it refers to the growth of new bone on the surface of a bone, usually in response to pressure or friction. It is not typically associated with lesions in the otic capsule.

D. Otosclerosis is an incorrect choice because it is a condition that affects the middle ear and causes bone growth in the otic capsule, but it typically presents with conductive hearing loss and tinnitus, rather than the mixed hearing loss and symptoms described in the patient.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and imaging results, the most likely diagnosis is fibrous dysplasia.

**Answer**:A. Angiosarcoma

Explanation:

A. Angiosarcoma is the correct diagnosis because it is a malignant neoplasm that arises from the endothelial cells lining blood vessels. The clinical presentation of a rapidly growing vascular mass within the thyroid, along with the pathological features of pleomorphic epithelioid cells with enlarged, hyperchromatic nuclei, irregular nuclear membranes, and increased mitotic activity, are consistent with angiosarcoma. The strong membrane reactivity for CD31, which confirms an endothelial origin of the lesion, further supports this diagnosis.

B. Multinodular goiter with hemorrhagic cyst is an incorrect diagnosis because, although the patient had a previous diagnosis of multinodular goiter, the current presentation of a rapidly growing vascular mass within the thyroid and the pathological features of pleomorphic epithelioid cells with enlarged, hyperchromatic nuclei, irregular nuclear membranes, and increased mitotic activity, are not consistent with a benign multinodular goiter.

C. Anaplastic (undifferentiated) thyroid carcinoma is an incorrect diagnosis because, although it is a malignant neoplasm that can arise in the thyroid, the clinical and pathological features described in the case do not support this diagnosis. Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma typically presents with a rapidly growing mass in the neck, often with associated symptoms such as dysphagia, odynophagia, and neck swelling. The pathological features of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma include a highly cellular, undifferentiated tumor with a high mitotic rate, necrosis, and hemorrhage. While some of these features may be present in the current case, the presence of pleomorphic epithelioid cells with enlarged, hyperchromatic nuclei, irregular nuclear membranes, and increased mitotic activity, along with the strong membrane reactivity for CD31, are more consistent with angiosarcoma.

**Answer**: B. Laryngeal actinomycosis.

The correct answer is B. Laryngeal actinomycosis because the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, as well as the histopathologic images of the biopsied lesion, are consistent with this diagnosis.

Actinomycosis is a chronic bacterial infection caused by Actinomyces species, which are normal flora in the oropharynx and gastrointestinal tract. Laryngeal actinomycosis is a rare form of the infection that affects the larynx and can cause hoarseness, dysphagia, and odynophagia.

The patient's symptoms of worsening hoarseness over several years, without any other respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms, are consistent with laryngeal actinomycosis. The physical examination finding of a rough voice and the appearance of the lesion on flexible nasolaryngoscopy, which is a white sessile lesion starting at the right midfold on the superior and medial surfaces that crossed the midline to involve the entire left vocal fold, are also consistent with this diagnosis.

The histopathologic images of the biopsied lesion show a characteristic "sulfur" or "cotton-ball" appearance, which is consistent with actinomycosis. The Gram stain and Gomori methenamine silver stain images show numerous Actinomyces organisms, which confirm the diagnosis.

In contrast, laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (choice A) would typically present with a more aggressive clinical course, with symptoms such as dysphagia, odynophagia, and neck mass. The histopathologic images would show a malignant epithelial tumor, rather than the characteristic "sulfur" appearance of actinomycosis.

Laryngeal candidiasis (choice C) is a fungal infection that can cause hoarseness and dysphagia, but it typically presents with a more acute onset and would not have the same chronic, indol

**Answer**: D. Substernal goiter

The patient's symptoms, such as mild but worsening orthopnea exacerbated by lying down, and the absence of any recent weight loss, muscle weakness, or diplopia, are consistent with a substernal goiter. Additionally, the patient's surgical history, including a cesarean section, increases the likelihood of a substernal goiter. The patient's age and lack of radiation exposure also support this diagnosis.

The computed tomographic scan of the chest (Figure, A) reveals a mediastinal mass, which is consistent with a substernal goiter. The intraoperative dissection following median sternotomy (Figure, B) also supports this diagnosis, as it shows the mass to be located in the substernal region.

Thymoma (choice A) is a type of cancer that originates in the thymus gland, which is located in the mediastinum. While it is possible that the mass could be a thymoma, the patient's symptoms and surgical history do not strongly support this diagnosis.

Teratoma (choice B) is a type of tumor that originates from pluripotent cells and can contain a variety of different tissue types. While it is possible that the mass could be a teratoma, the patient's symptoms and surgical history do not strongly support this diagnosis.

Lymphoma (choice C) is a type of cancer that originates in the lymphatic system. While it is possible that the mass could be a lymphoma, the patient's symptoms and surgical history do not strongly support this diagnosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Substernal goiter.

**Answer**:C. Radiation-induced myositis

The patient's symptoms of severe right shoulder pain, sharp and constant, localized to his right scapula and radiating down the extensor surface of his arm, are consistent with radiation-induced myositis. This is a known side effect of radiation therapy, particularly in patients who have received high doses of radiation to the chest area, as in this case. The patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis and smoking may also contribute to the development of radiation-induced myositis.

Option A, metastatic non-small cell lung cancer, is unlikely as the patient's cancer had decreased in size on the surveillance CT scan obtained at 3 months, and there is no evidence of new metastases on the right shoulder diagnostic imaging.

Option B, rib fracture, is unlikely as the patient did not report any inciting events that could have led to a fracture, and there is no evidence of bone abnormalities on the CT scan or MRI.

Option D, polymyalgia rheumatica, is also unlikely as the patient's symptoms are localized to the right shoulder and arm, rather than the widespread muscle pain and stiffness typically seen in polymyalgia rheumatica. Additionally, the patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis and smoking may increase the risk of radiation-induced myositis, but do not support the diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica.

**Answer**:D. The results indicate histopathologic discordance.

The correct answer is D, "The results indicate histopathologic discordance," because the test results described in the question demonstrate a discrepancy between the ER and ERBB2 (HER2) status of the tumor. ER was strongly positive in 95% of tumor cells, while ERBB2 (HER2) by immunohistochemistry (IHC) was scored as 1+, which is considered equivocal and repeat testing is needed. This discrepancy between the ER and ERBB2 (HER2) status suggests that there may be histopathologic discordance, which refers to a situation where the histological features of a tumor do not match the expected molecular characteristics. In this case, the discordance is between the ER and ERBB2 (HER2) status, and it may indicate that the tumor is composed of different subclones or that there is heterogeneity in the expression of these markers within the tumor. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.

Option A, "The patient has ERBB2 (HER2)–negative breast cancer," is incorrect because the IHC score of 1+ indicates that the ERBB2 (HER2) status is equivocal and repeat testing is needed, rather than definitively negative.

Option B, "The patient has ERBB2 (HER2)–positive breast cancer," is also incorrect because the IHC score of 1+ does not meet the criteria for a positive ERBB2 (HER2) status, and repeat testing is needed to confirm the status.

Option C, "The result is equivocal and repeat testing is needed," is incorrect because it does not fully address the histopathologic discordance between the ER and ERBB2 (HER2) status. While repeat testing may be needed to confirm the ERBB2 (HER2) status, the discordance between the ER and ERBB2 (HER2) status suggests that there may be underlying biological heterogeneity in the tumor that needs to be further investigated.

Sure! Here's my explanation:

**Answer**: C

The patient's symptoms of neck pain, stiffness, and periorbital edema, along with the physical examination findings of facial swelling, brawny periorbital edema, and a large area of diffuse, slightly erythematous, nonpitting woody induration extending from the nape of his neck to the upper back, shoulders, and upper arms, are consistent with diabetic scleredema (scleredema diabeticorum). This is a rare complication of diabetes that is characterized by thickening and hardening of the skin, typically on the neck, upper back, and shoulders. The patient's history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and hypothyroidism also supports this diagnosis.

A skin biopsy from the upper back would be the appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis of diabetic scleredema. This would allow for a histopathological examination of the skin tissue, which would show characteristic features such as thickening of the skin, increased collagen deposition, and inflammation.

Measure 24-hour urine protein (choice A) may be useful in evaluating the patient's kidney function and detecting any proteinuria, which is a common complication of diabetes. However, it would not specifically help in diagnosing diabetic scleredema.

Obtain a 2D echocardiogram (choice B) may be useful in evaluating the patient's cardiac function and detecting any cardiac complications of diabetes, such as left ventricular hypertrophy or diastolic dysfunction. However, it would not specifically help in diagnosing diabetic scleredema.

Obtain a thoracic computed tomography scan (choice D) may be useful in evaluating the patient's lung and mediastinal structures, and detecting any lung or pleural complications of diabetes, such as pulmonary embolism or pleural effusion. However, it would not specifically help in diagnosing diabetic scleredema.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: Obtain a skin biopsy from the upper back.

**Answer**:C. Petrified ear

The patient's symptoms and examination findings, as well as the results of the biopsy and CT scan, are consistent with the diagnosis of petrified ear. Petrified ear, also known as auricular petrification or calcified ear, is a rare condition characterized by the gradual hardening and calcification of the cartilage of the auricle, leading to immobility and rigidity of the ear. This condition is often associated with chronic renal failure and hyperparathyroidism, as in this patient. The patient's history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and secondary chronic renal insufficiency, as well as his elevated creatinine level and hemoglobin level, support this diagnosis. The patient's normal serum calcium level and lack of other symptoms consistent with hyperparathyroidism, such as bone pain or kidney stones, suggest that the petrified ear is likely due to chronic renal failure rather than hyperparathyroidism.

Chondrodermatitis nodularis helicis chronicus (choice A) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the auricle that causes nodular thickening of the skin and cartilage. While this condition can cause ear pain and tenderness, it does not cause the degree of calcification and rigidity seen in this patient.

Relapsing polychondritis (choice B) is a rare autoimmune disorder that causes inflammation and degeneration of cartilage in various parts of the body, including the auricle. However, this condition typically causes a more sudden onset of symptoms and is associated with a more widespread inflammatory response.

Scleroderma (choice D) is a chronic autoimmune disorder that causes fibrosis and hardening of the skin and other connective tissue. While scleroderma can affect the ears and cause calcification of the cartilage, it typically causes a more widespread involvement of the skin and internal organs.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, examination findings, and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is petrified ear, or auricular pet

**Answer**: B. Lucio phenomenon

The correct answer is B. Lucio phenomenon because it matches the given symptoms and signs. Lucio phenomenon is a rare condition characterized by the development of necrotic and ulcerated plaques on the skin, particularly on the extremities, face, and genital area. The condition is often associated with peripheral nerve damage and hypoesthesia, which are also present in this case. The patient's symptoms of numbness and tingling sensations in the hands and feet, followed by the development of ulcerative lesions on the soles, legs, hands, elbow joints, and face, are consistent with Lucio phenomenon.

The other answer choices do not match the patient's symptoms and signs:

A. Erythema nodosum leprosum is a condition characterized by the development of tender, red nodules on the skin, often associated with leprosy. The patient does not have a history of leprosy, and the nodules are not tender.

C. Cutaneous small vessel vasculitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the small blood vessels in the skin, leading to redness, swelling, and ulceration. The patient's symptoms of numbness and tingling sensations in the hands and feet, followed by the development of ulcerative lesions, are not consistent with cutaneous small vessel vasculitis.

D. Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa is a condition characterized by inflammation of the medium-sized blood vessels in the skin, leading to redness, swelling, and ulceration. The patient's symptoms of numbness and tingling sensations in the hands and feet, followed by the development of ulcerative lesions, are not consistent with cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa.

**Answer**:A. Erythema elevatum diutinum

Erythema elevatum diutinum (EED) is a rare, chronic skin condition characterized by the development of recurrent, itchy, erythematous plaques and nodules on the extensor surfaces of the limbs. The case presented fits this description, with the patient experiencing a 6-month history of itchy eruptions that started on the arms and spread to the lower legs, and the presence of erythematous patches and plaques on the arms and lower legs, as well as nontender violaceous firm nodules on the elbows, wrist, ankle, interphalangeal, and metatarsophalangeal joints. The absence of lymphadenopathy also supports this diagnosis.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare, necrotizing skin condition that typically presents with painful, ulcerative lesions with a characteristic "punched-out" or "crater-like" appearance. While the patient did report occasional burning sensation of new lesions, the absence of pain and the presence of nodules rather than ulcers argue against this diagnosis.

Multicentric reticulohistiocytosis (MRH) is a rare, benign condition characterized by the proliferation of histiocytes and the formation of papulonodular lesions on the skin and other organs. While the patient's age and the presence of nodules are consistent with MRH, the absence of other organs involvement and the lack of histiocytic infiltrate on biopsy argue against this diagnosis.

Sweet syndrome (SS) is a rare, autoimmune condition characterized by the development of painful, erythematous, and edematous plaques on the skin, often in response to an underlying infection or inflammatory condition. While the patient's age and the presence of erythematous plaques are consistent with SS, the absence of fevers, fatigue, myalgias, arthritis, shortness of breath, oral ulcers, and recent infections argues against this diagnosis.

**Answer**:A. Primary central nervous system lymphoma–leptomeningeal variant

The patient's symptoms and examination findings, along with the MRI and CSF results, are consistent with a diagnosis of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) with a leptomeningeal variant. PCNSL is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that affects the brain and spinal cord. The leptomeningeal variant is characterized by involvement of the leptomeninges, which are the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord.

The patient's symptoms of progressive bilateral lower extremity weakness, left facial weakness, and diplopia, as well as the physical examination findings of decreased bulk and hypotonia throughout all extremities, are consistent with a lower motor neuron syndrome, which is a common presentation of PCNSL. The patient's history of recent significant weight loss and new-onset urinary incontinence also support the diagnosis of PCNSL.

The MRI findings of leptomeningeal enhancement around the cerebral convexities, cerebellum, and spinal cord, including the cauda equina, are consistent with PCNSL. The CSF studies showed a lymphocytic predominance, which is also consistent with PCNSL. The negative results for tuberculosis and fungal infections, as well as the absence of malignant cells on cytology analysis, make other infectious causes less likely.

The whole-body positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT) showed extensive leptomeningeal and nerve root hypermetabolism, which is consistent with PCNSL. The absence of evidence of a primary malignancy on the PET-CT also supports the diagnosis of PCNSL.

In contrast, carcinomatous meningitis, which is a complication of certain types of cancer, such as lung cancer, breast cancer, or melanoma, is less likely given the absence of a primary malignancy on the PET-CT. Tubercular meningitis is also less likely given the negative results for tuberculosis and the absence of other

**Answer**:A. Observe; follow up in 4 to 6 weeks with SD-OCT.

Explanation:
The patient presents with acute, monocular, painless vision loss, and the fundus examination reveals a neurosensory retinal detachment, retinal pigment epithelial discoloration, and retinal hemorrhages. The patient denies recent corticosteroid use, joint pain, weight loss, myalgias, or cardiovascular, neurologic, or gastrointestinal symptoms. The patient had fevers and mild upper respiratory tract symptoms 2 weeks before presentation, closely followed by a rash on his hands and thighs. A young family member had similar symptoms.

Given the patient's history and examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is exudative macular detachment (EMD) due to a viral illness. EMD is a rare complication of viral infections, and it is characterized by the sudden onset of painless vision loss, with a macular detachment that is often associated with retinal pigment epithelial discoloration and retinal hemorrhages.

The appropriate management for this patient would be to observe and follow up in 4 to 6 weeks with SD-OCT, as choice A suggests. SD-OCT is a non-invasive imaging technique that provides high-resolution cross-sectional images of the retina and choroid, allowing for the evaluation of the retinal structure and the detection of any changes in the retinal thickness and morphology. By following up with SD-OCT, the clinician can monitor the progression of the disease and assess any potential changes in the retinal detachment.

The other choices are not appropriate for the management of this patient.

Choice B, starting oral prednisone therapy, may be considered for patients with uveitis or scleritis, but it is not the first line of treatment for EMD. Corticosteroids may be used in some cases of EMD, but only after other treatments have failed, and under close monitoring for potential side effects.

The correct answer is D. Ultrasound biomicroscopy.

**A. Brachytherapy**
Brachytherapy is a treatment that involves placing a radioactive source directly into the eye to treat certain types of eye cancer. However, it is not the appropriate next step in this case because the patient's tumor is located in the temporal periphery of the retina, and brachytherapy is typically used to treat tumors that are located in the central part of the eye. Additionally, brachytherapy is usually reserved for cases where the tumor is causing symptoms or is growing rapidly, and the patient's tumor is currently asymptomatic and has not shown any signs of growth.

**B. Biopsy**
A biopsy involves removing a small sample of tissue from the tumor and examining it under a microscope to determine the type of cells that make up the tumor. While a biopsy could potentially provide valuable information about the nature of the tumor, it is not the most appropriate next step in this case because the patient's tumor is located in a sensitive area of the eye, and the risk of complications from a biopsy procedure may outweigh the potential benefits.

**C. Observation**
Observation is a reasonable option in this case because the patient's tumor is currently asymptomatic and has not shown any signs of growth. However, it is important to monitor the patient closely to ensure that the tumor does not grow or cause any symptoms, and ultrasound biomicroscopy is a non-invasive and relatively low-risk procedure that can help to achieve this goal.

**D. Ultrasound biomicroscopy**
Ultrasound biomicroscopy is a non-invasive imaging technique that uses high-frequency sound waves to produce detailed images of the eye's internal structures. It is particularly useful for evaluating tumors in the eye because it can provide information about the size, shape, and location of the tumor without the need for a biopsy or other invasive procedures. In this case, ultrasound biomicroscopy is the most appropriate next step because it can help to determine the nature of the patient's tumor and guide further management decisions.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is D: Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) with embolization of CCF.

Let's go through each choice and explain why it's incorrect or correct:

A: Perform surgical plugging of the carotid cavernous fistula with a muscle patch.

This choice is incorrect because the patient's main issue is an enlarged superior orbital fissure (SOF) caused by trauma, which is not directly related to a carotid cavernous fistula. While a carotid cavernous fistula may require surgical intervention, it's not the primary concern in this case.

B: Conservative management.

This choice is incorrect because the patient's symptoms, such as proptosis, chemosis, dilated conjunctival blood vessels, and restricted elevation of the left eye, indicate a more severe condition that requires prompt intervention. Conservative management may not effectively address the underlying issues.

C: Trabeculectomy or drainage procedure.

This choice is incorrect because the patient's issue is not primarily related to the trabecular meshwork or aqueous humor drainage. Trabeculectomy or drainage procedures are typically used to treat conditions such as glaucoma, which is not the primary diagnosis in this case.

D: Digital subtraction angiography (DSA) with embolization of CCF.

This choice is correct because it addresses the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, which is the enlarged SOF caused by trauma. DSA is a minimally invasive procedure that can help identify and embolize the abnormal vessels responsible for the fistula, thereby reducing the risk of further complications and improving the patient's symptoms.

In summary, DSA with embolization of CCF is the most appropriate choice for this patient's condition, as it directly addresses the root cause of the symptoms and has a lower risk of complications compared to surgical intervention.

**Answer**: C. Ischemic stroke

The correct answer is C. Ischemic stroke because the patient's symptoms of sudden onset of right-sided weakness, facial droop, and difficulty speaking are consistent with a stroke. The patient's history of trisomy 21 also increases the risk of stroke. Additionally, the patient's recent surgery and general anesthesia may have contributed to the development of stroke.

The other answer choices are not as likely because:

A. Opiate-induced anamnestic recall of prior deficits: While the patient's recent surgery and use of opiates may have contributed to their symptoms, the sudden onset of weakness and facial droop are not typical of opiate-induced anamnestic recall.

B. Focal seizures with postictal hemiparesis: The patient's symptoms do not suggest a seizure disorder, and there is no evidence of a recent seizure event.

D. Acute demyelinating disorder: While demyelinating disorders can cause weakness and facial droop, the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a stroke, and there is no evidence of demyelination on the patient's MRI.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, the most likely diagnosis is C. Ischemic stroke.

**Answer**: B. Intraductal papilloma

The patient's symptoms and test results indicate that she has an intraductal papilloma. The patient had a slowly growing mass on the left side of her neck that had been there for four weeks. A neck CT scan revealed a 3.8-cm cystic mass in the left floor of the mouth. An ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy showed clusters of bland-appearing cuboidal to columnar epithelial cells with no malignant cells identified. These findings indicate that the mass is likely to be benign. An intraductal papilloma is a benign tumor that grows in the salivary gland ducts and can cause a mass in the neck.

The other choices are not correct because:

A. Low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma: This is a type of cancer that grows in the salivary glands, but it is more aggressive than an intraductal papilloma and typically has a more complex histology. The patient's biopsy results showed bland-appearing cuboidal to columnar epithelial cells, which do not fit with the histology of a low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma.

C. Warthin tumor: This is a type of benign tumor that grows in the salivary glands, but it typically affects the parotid gland and is rare in the floor of mouth. The patient's symptoms and test results do not suggest a Warthin tumor.

D. Acinic cell carcinoma: This is a type of cancer that grows in the salivary glands, but it is more aggressive than an intraductal papilloma and typically has a more complex histology. The patient's biopsy results showed bland-appearing cuboidal to columnar epithelial cells, which do not fit with the histology of an acinic cell carcinoma.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and test results, the most likely diagnosis is an intraductal papilloma.

**Answer**:A. Complications of otitis media

The correct answer is A, Complications of otitis media, because the patient's symptoms and findings are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient has a history of otitis media (middle ear infection) and recent fevers, which can lead to complications such as a bulging, hyperemic tympanic membrane and fullness of the postauricular, upper cervical region. The patient's age and history of autism also increase the likelihood of this diagnosis.

Choice B, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, is an incorrect diagnosis because it is a rare condition that typically affects the skin and lymph nodes, and is not commonly associated with otitis media or the patient's symptoms.

Choice C, Rhabdomyosarcoma, is also an incorrect diagnosis because it is a type of cancer that typically affects the soft tissues of the body, and is not commonly associated with otitis media or the patient's symptoms.

**Answer**:A. Endolymphatic sac tumor

The correct answer is A, Endolymphatic sac tumor, for the following reasons:

1. Endolymphatic sac tumor (EST) is a rare benign tumor that originates from the endolymphatic sac, which is a part of the inner ear. ESTs are typically slow-growing and can cause symptoms similar to those of the patient in the case, such as hearing loss, tinnitus, and balance difficulties.
2. The patient's symptoms of long-standing discharge and hearing loss in the left ear, as well as mild dizziness, are consistent with EST. The patient's age and lack of facial weakness also align with the typical presentation of EST.
3. The CT scan findings of a soft-tissue mass in the mastoid and middle ear cavity extending to the external ear canal, with no significant erosion of ossicles, are consistent with EST. The mass in the mastoid cavity was found to be full of edematous, fragile soft tissue with mucoid secretions, which is also consistent with EST.
4. The histopathological examination revealed a polypoid lesion showing typical papillary architecture with central fibrovascular cores and dilated glandular structures, lined by a bland-looking single layer of high columnar/cuboidal epithelial cells. This is consistent with the characteristic histological features of EST.
5. Immunohistochemical staining showed positivity for cytokeratin-7 (CK7), CK19, epithelial membrane antigen, and glial fibrillary acidic protein, which are all markers that are commonly expressed in EST. The low proliferation index of less than 1% on Ki-67 immunostain also supports the diagnosis of EST.

**Answer**: B. Isolated anosmia

The correct answer is B. Isolated anosmia because the patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient has a history of diminished smell, which is a common symptom of anosmia. The physical examination revealed a minimal hump on the dorsum of the nose, which is consistent with minor trauma to the nose, but no other abnormal findings. The patient also failed the Penn smell tests, which suggests a loss of olfactory function.

The magnetic resonance image of the anterior skull base showed absent olfactory sulci (OS) and bilateral olfactory grooves containing minimal tissue. This suggests that the patient has a loss of olfactory tissue, which is consistent with isolated anosmia.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Cerebrospinal fluid leak: This diagnosis is unlikely because the patient does not have any symptoms suggestive of a cerebrospinal fluid leak, such as headache, nausea, or vomiting. Additionally, the physical examination and imaging findings do not support this diagnosis.

C. Sarcoidosis: Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease that can affect the olfactory system, but it is unlikely in this case because the patient does not have any other symptoms or findings consistent with sarcoidosis, such as skin lesions, joint pain, or lung disease.

D. Upper respiratory infection: An upper respiratory infection can cause a loss of smell, but it is unlikely in this case because the patient's symptoms have been present for years, and there is no evidence of an active infection on examination or imaging.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Isolated anosmia.

**Answer**: A. Thyroglossal duct fistula

The correct answer is A, Thyroglossal duct fistula, for the following reasons:

A. Thyroglossal duct fistula:
A thyroglossal duct fistula is a type of congenital anomaly that occurs when the thyroglossal duct, which is a remnant of the embryonic connection between the thyroid gland and the tongue, fails to close properly during fetal development. This results in a tract that connects the skin of the neck to the thyroid gland, which can produce chronic purulent discharge. The patient's symptoms of a small opening in the left lateral side of the neck that produced chronic purulent discharge, despite several previous attempts at surgical resection, are consistent with a thyroglossal duct fistula. The fact that the tract extended from the skin of the lateral side of the neck to the left strap muscles, as shown in the CT image, also supports this diagnosis.

B. Branchial cleft fistula:
A branchial cleft fistula is a type of congenital anomaly that occurs when the branchial cleft, which is a remnant of the embryonic connection between the neck and the thorax, fails to close properly during fetal development. This results in a tract that connects the skin of the neck to the thorax, which can produce chronic purulent discharge. However, the patient's symptoms and the location of the tract do not support this diagnosis, as the branchial cleft is typically located higher up in the neck, near the jugular notch, and the discharge is usually not as persistent as in the case of a thyroglossal duct fistula.

C. Nonhealing surgical tract:
A nonhealing surgical tract is a complication that can occur after surgery, where the wound fails to heal properly, leading to chronic drainage. However, this diagnosis is unlikely in this case, as the patient had a history of chronic purulent discharge for 6 years, which suggests a longer-standing issue rather than a recent surgical complication.

**Answer**: D. Takayasu arteritis

The patient's symptoms of progressive bilateral lower extremity pain, particularly in the buttocks and thighs, and the physical examination findings of weakly palpable femoral pulses and non-palpable pedal pulses, are consistent with peripheral artery disease. The laboratory finding of an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and the imaging findings of mild stenosis of bilateral subclavian arteries and an abnormal-appearing infrarenal aorta on magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) support the diagnosis of Takayasu arteritis.

Takayasu arteritis is a rare inflammatory disease that affects the large and medium-sized arteries, primarily the aorta and its major branches. It is characterized by stenosis or occlusion of the affected arteries, leading to decreased blood flow to the organs and tissues downstream. The symptoms of Takayasu arteritis can vary depending on the location and severity of the stenosis or occlusion, and may include pain, weakness, or numbness in the affected limbs.

The other answer choices are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and imaging findings. Middle aortic syndrome is a rare condition characterized by stenosis or occlusion of the middle aorta, which can cause symptoms similar to Takayasu arteritis. However, the patient's imaging findings do not support this diagnosis, as the stenosis is located in the subclavian arteries and the infrarenal aorta, rather than the middle aorta. Inflammatory aneurysm is a possible complication of Takayasu arteritis, but it is not a diagnosis that explains the patient's symptoms and imaging findings. Giant cell arteritis is a vasculitis that affects the medium and large arteries, primarily the temporal arteries, and is characterized by headache, fever, and visual disturbances, which are not present in this patient.

**Answer**: C. Ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma

The correct answer is C. Ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma because it best fits the patient's symptoms and the imaging findings described in the case.

A. Ruptured giant cavernous hemangioma is an incorrect choice because, although this condition can cause hemorrhage, it typically presents with a different set of symptoms, such as pain, swelling, and bruising in the affected area. Additionally, the imaging findings described in the case, such as a large heterogeneous mass with intrahepatic and intraperitoneal hemorrhage, are not consistent with a cavernous hemangioma.

B. Ruptured complex cystic liver mass is also an incorrect choice because, although this condition can cause hemorrhage and present with abdominal pain, the imaging findings described in the case do not support this diagnosis. The patient's CT scan showed a large, heterogeneous mass with irregular margins, which is not consistent with a complex cystic liver mass.

D. Spontaneous liver bleeding is an incorrect choice because, although this can occur in patients with liver disease, it is not the most likely diagnosis given the patient's symptoms and imaging findings. Spontaneous liver bleeding is often associated with liver cirrhosis, and the patient's history of hepatitis C cirrhosis increases the likelihood of a bleeding disorder. However, the presence of a large mass with hemorrhage suggests a more focal source of bleeding, which is consistent with ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is ruptured hepatocellular carcinoma.

Answer: C. The significance of the amino acid exchange in CARD11 is a variant of unknown significance, so treatment with ibrutinib may be considered.

Explanation:

A. CARD11 mutation is associated with ibrutinib resistance, therefore ibrutinib should not be used.
This choice is incorrect because the test results indicate that the CARD11 mutation is a variant of unknown significance, meaning that its impact on ibrutinib resistance is not clear. Therefore, it is not appropriate to assume that the patient will definitely develop resistance to ibrutinib based solely on the presence of this mutation.

B. CARD11 mutation is found only in a subclonal population and thus ibrutinib should be avoided.
This choice is incorrect because the test results do not provide information about the prevalence of the CARD11 mutation within the patient's cancer cells. Therefore, it is unclear whether the mutation is present in a subclonal population or throughout the entire tumor. In the absence of this information, it is not appropriate to assume that ibrutinib should be avoided.

D. The significance of the amino acid exchange in CARD11 is a variant of unknown significance, so treatment with ibrutinib should not be considered.
This choice is incorrect because the test results indicate that the CARD11 mutation is a variant of unknown significance, meaning that its impact on treatment with ibrutinib is not clear. Therefore, it is not appropriate to assume that treatment with ibrutinib should not be considered based solely on the presence of this mutation. Instead, further research or clinical trials may be necessary to determine the efficacy and safety of ibrutinib in patients with CLL and CARD11 mutations.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. The significance of the amino acid exchange in CARD11 is a variant of unknown significance, so treatment with ibrutinib may be considered. This answer acknowledges the uncertainty surrounding the impact of the CARD11 mutation on ibrutinib treatment and suggests that further research or clinical trials may be necessary to determine the best course of action for this patient.

**Answer**: C

The correct answer is C, "Order carotid ultrasound."

The patient's symptoms of blurry vision, along with the physical examination findings of a body mass index (BMI) of 30.6 and a blood pressure of 160/102 mm Hg, suggest that the patient may have diabetes. The dilated examination of the retina shown in the figure also suggests diabetic retinopathy (DR).

Carotid ultrasound is a non-invasive test that can help evaluate the patient's risk of stroke and assess the severity of diabetic retinopathy. It can detect carotid artery stenosis, which is a common complication of diabetes and can cause vision loss. Therefore, ordering a carotid ultrasound is the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation.

The other answer choices are not as appropriate for the following reasons:

A. Measure hemoglobin A1c level: While measuring hemoglobin A1c level can help diagnose diabetes, it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings already suggest diabetes, and a hemoglobin A1c test may not provide any new information.

B. Evaluate for hypercoagulable disorders: Hypercoagulable disorders, such as antiphospholipid syndrome, can cause vision loss, but they are not typically associated with diabetic retinopathy. Therefore, evaluating for hypercoagulable disorders is not the most appropriate next step.

D. Order magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain: MRI of the brain may be appropriate if the patient had symptoms or signs of a central nervous system disorder, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest diabetic retinopathy, which is a peripheral rather than central nervous system disorder.

I hope this explanation helps clarify why C, "Order carotid ultrasound," is the correct answer.

**Answer**: A. The elevated testosterone level is consistent with PCOS.

The correct answer is A because an elevated testosterone level is a common characteristic of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a hormonal disorder that affects women of reproductive age and is characterized by high levels of androgens (male hormones) in the body. Testosterone is one of the androgens that are produced in excess in PCOS, leading to symptoms such as acne, excessive facial and body hair growth, and male pattern baldness.

In this case, the patient's testosterone level was elevated, which is consistent with PCOS. The other options are incorrect because:

**B**: A normal fasting glucose level does not exclude abnormal glucose tolerance. While it is true that women with PCOS are at increased risk of developing insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, a normal fasting glucose level does not rule out the possibility of PCOS.

**C**: A normal luteinizing hormone-to-follicle-stimulating hormone ratio does not exclude PCOS. While a normal LH/FSH ratio may suggest that the patient does not have PCOS, it is not a definitive diagnostic criterion. Some women with PCOS may have a normal LH/FSH ratio, especially in the early stages of the disorder.

**D**: The diagnosis of PCOS requires documentation of polycystic ovaries by ultrasonography. While ultrasonography can be used to support the diagnosis of PCOS, it is not a definitive diagnostic criterion. PCOS can be diagnosed based on clinical and laboratory findings, and ultrasonography may not always be necessary for diagnosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is A, as an elevated testosterone level is a consistent feature of PCOS.

**Answer**: A. Drug-induced hyperkalemia

The patient's history of medication use, specifically trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and the recent onset of generalized weakness, suggest drug-induced hyperkalemia as the most likely diagnosis. Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole can cause hyperkalemia as a side effect, particularly in patients with pre-existing potassium imbalances or those taking other medications that affect potassium levels.

The patient's potassium level of 5.9 mEq/L is elevated, which supports the diagnosis of hyperkalemia. Additionally, the patient's history of heart failure and chronic kidney disease increases the likelihood of drug-induced hyperkalemia, as these conditions can impair the body's ability to regulate potassium levels.

The other answer choices do not fit the patient's presentation as well:

B. Excessive potassium intake: There is no evidence to suggest that the patient has consumed excessive amounts of potassium.

C. Pseudohyperkalemia: Pseudohyperkalemia is a condition where the potassium level appears elevated due to hemolysis or leukocytosis, but the true potassium level is normal. This is not the case for our patient, as the potassium level is genuinely elevated.

D. Transcellular potassium shift: This is a rare condition where potassium shifts from the intracellular to the extracellular space, causing hyperkalemia. There is no evidence to suggest that this is the cause of the patient's hyperkalemia.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient's presentation is drug-induced hyperkalemia, making answer choice A the correct answer.

**Answer**:B. Bullous amyloidosis

The patient's symptoms, including progressive, painful blisters and ulcers on the groin, perianal area, and buttocks, as well as macroglossia, glossitis, and purpura on the lips, are consistent with bullous amyloidosis. Bullous amyloidosis is a rare autoimmune disease that is characterized by the deposition of amyloid fibrils in the dermis, leading to the formation of blisters and bullae. The patient's history of numbness in the distal lower limbs and declining mobility, as well as the presence of purpuric macules on the lips, inframammary folds, forearms, and thighs, also support this diagnosis.

The patient's laboratory results, including a low platelet count, prolonged prothrombin time, and low serum zinc levels, are also consistent with bullous amyloidosis. The patient's history of IgG λ-type multiple myeloma and anemia further supports this diagnosis, as bullous amyloidosis is often associated with plasma cell dyscrasias.

The other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms. Bullous pemphigoid (choice A) is a rare autoimmune disease that is characterized by the formation of blisters and bullae on the skin, but it typically affects the elderly and is associated with a different set of symptoms, such as pruritus, skin fragility, and a history of recent medication use. Herpes simplex infection (choice C) can cause blisters and ulcers on the skin, but it typically affects the mouth and genital area, and the patient's symptoms are not consistent with this diagnosis. Cutaneous candidiasis (choice D) can cause skin lesions, but it typically appears as red, scaly patches or plaques, and is not associated with blisters or bullae.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is bullous amyloidosis.

**Answer**:C. Granulomatous cheilitis

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with granulomatous cheilitis. The patient's history of HIV and the presence of erythematous papules at the vermillion border of the lower lip, along with edema and slight fissuring of the tongue, are all consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's history of verruca vulgaris and dyshidrotic eczema may also be relevant, as these conditions can sometimes be associated with granulomatous cheilitis.

The histopathologic findings of a nodular, nonnecrotizing granulomatous dermatitis with epithelioid histiocytes and admixed lymphocytes, as seen in the biopsy specimen, are also consistent with granulomatous cheilitis.

The other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and findings.

A. Oral sarcoidosis: Sarcoidosis is a systemic granulomatous disease that can affect the oral tissues, but the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are not consistent with this diagnosis. The patient does not report any of the typical symptoms of oral sarcoidosis, such as ulcerations, nodules, or swelling of the lips, tongue, or palate. Additionally, the histopathologic findings do not support this diagnosis, as there is no evidence of noncaseating granulomas.

B. Postherpetic granulomatous reaction: This diagnosis is unlikely, as the patient does not report any history of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection or any other viral infection that could trigger a postherpetic granulomatous reaction. Additionally, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest a reactivation of a previous viral infection.

**Answer**: B. Muir-Torre syndrome

Muir-Torre syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by the development of multiple sebaceous tumors, including sebaceous adenomas and sebaceous carcinomas. The syndrome is caused by mutations in the MAP3K5 gene, which is involved in the signaling pathways that regulate cell growth and differentiation.

The patient's presentation of a rapidly growing, painful nodule on her upper cutaneous lip, as well as several smaller papules on her face and neck, is consistent with the characteristic skin manifestations of Muir-Torre syndrome. The patient's family history, with a paternal grandfather who died from melanoma and a father who died from colon cancer, also suggests a possible genetic predisposition to develop cancer.

In contrast, Cowden syndrome, also known as multiple hamartoma syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by the development of multiple hamartomas, which are benign growths that can occur in various organs and tissues. While Cowden syndrome can also present with skin manifestations, such as papillomatoses and sebaceous hyperplasia, the skin lesions are typically not as aggressive as those seen in Muir-Torre syndrome.

Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by the development of multiple fibrofolliculomas, which are benign growths that occur in the skin and are composed of fibroblasts and follicular cells. While Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome can also present with skin manifestations, such as papules and nodules, the characteristic fibrofolliculomas are not typically seen in Muir-Torre syndrome.

Basal cell nevus syndrome, also known as Gorlin syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by the development of multiple basal cell carcinomas, which are a type of skin cancer.

**Answer**:B. Check blood and urine for heavy metals

The patient's symptoms of acquired color blindness, visual loss, and peripheral neuropathy, along with the physical examination findings of temporal optic nerve pallor and bilateral central scotomas on automated perimetry, suggest a possible diagnosis of optic nerve atrophy. The patient's history of recent hospitalization for confusion, short-term memory loss, vomiting, and diarrhea, as well as the presence of a facial rash, hoarseness, and painful peripheral neuropathy in his feet, suggest a systemic or metabolic disorder may be contributing to the optic nerve atrophy.

Checking for heavy metals in the blood and urine is a reasonable next step in the diagnostic workup, as heavy metal toxicity can cause optic nerve damage and atrophy. Heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and arsenic can accumulate in the body over time and cause damage to various organs, including the optic nerve. The patient's symptoms of confusion, memory loss, and peripheral neuropathy may also be consistent with heavy metal toxicity.

Testing for mitochondrial optic neuropathies (choice A) may also be appropriate, as mitochondrial disorders can cause optic nerve atrophy and other neurological symptoms. However, the patient's symptoms and examination findings do not strongly suggest a mitochondrial disorder, and heavy metal toxicity is a more likely cause of optic nerve atrophy in this case.

Checking vitamin B12 levels and asking about smoking history (choice C) may also be appropriate, as vitamin B12 deficiency and smoking can both contribute to optic nerve damage. However, the patient's symptoms and examination findings do not strongly suggest a vitamin B12 deficiency or smoking-related optic neuropathy, and heavy metal toxicity is a more likely cause of optic nerve atrophy in this case.

**Answer**:A. Proceed with temporal artery biopsy

The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with cotton-wool spots associated with mild nonprogressive visual loss. The presence of bilateral nuclear sclerotic cataracts and elevated inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein) suggest a possible underlying inflammatory or infectious condition. The positive antinuclear antibody testing and lack of other significant medical history or symptoms support the possibility of a systemic autoimmune disorder.

Temporal artery biopsy is the appropriate next step to evaluate for giant cell arteritis (GCA), a condition that can cause cotton-wool spots and elevated inflammatory markers. GCA is a vasculitis that affects the medium and large arteries, primarily the temporal arteries. It is often associated with symptoms such as headache, fever, malaise, and visual disturbances, including cotton-wool spots. The patient's lack of symptoms and mild visual loss suggest a possible early stage of the disease.

Referring the patient to a primary care physician for management of hypertension (choice B) may not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and could lead to a delay in diagnosis and treatment of GCA.

Referring the patient for rheumatologic workup (choice C) may be appropriate if the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a rheumatologic disorder, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case.

Observing and reevaluating the patient in 2 months (choice D) may not be appropriate given the patient's symptoms and examination findings, as it may allow the disease to progress and potentially result in permanent visual loss.

Therefore, choice A, proceeding with temporal artery biopsy, is the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation and management.

**Answer**: D. Perform skin biopsy for immunofluorescence

**Explanation**:

A. Treat with oral acyclovir: This choice is incorrect because acyclovir is an antiviral medication used to treat herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infections. While the patient's symptoms of erosive stomatitis and cutaneous bullae may be consistent with a viral infection, there is no indication in the patient's history or physical examination to suggest a diagnosis of HSV or VZV. Therefore, treating the patient with oral acyclovir would not be appropriate at this time.

B. Perform renal biopsy: This choice is incorrect because the patient's primary symptoms are not related to renal disease. While the patient does have a recent history of weight loss and a elevated serum creatinine level, these findings are not necessarily indicative of renal disease. A renal biopsy would not be necessary at this time and would not provide information relevant to the patient's current symptoms.

C. Treat with oral corticosteroids: This choice is incorrect because corticosteroids are not typically used to treat viral infections. While corticosteroids may be used to treat certain autoimmune or inflammatory conditions, there is no indication in the patient's history or physical examination to suggest a diagnosis that would warrant corticosteroid therapy. Additionally, corticosteroids may worsen certain viral infections, such as herpes simplex.

D. Perform skin biopsy for immunofluorescence: This choice is correct because it would allow for a definitive diagnosis of the patient's skin lesions. Immunofluorescence can help identify the presence of certain antibodies or proteins in the skin, which can aid in the diagnosis of various autoimmune or inflammatory conditions. The patient's history of painful erosive lesions and cutaneous bullae, along with the presence of crusted plaques on her scalp, are consistent with a diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid,

**Answer**: B. Cutaneous fungal infection

The correct answer is B, Cutaneous fungal infection, because the patient's symptoms and biopsy results are consistent with a fungal infection. The biopsy specimen shows epidermal necrosis with fungal elements within the superficial dermis, and branching and septate hyphae within the superficial dermis, which are characteristic features of a fungal infection. The fact that the patient was treated empirically for sepsis with vancomycin hydrochloride and cefepime hydrochloride also suggests that the clinicians were concerned about the possibility of a fungal infection.

In contrast, the other answer choices are not supported by the patient's symptoms and biopsy results.

A, Pressure ulcer, is not a likely diagnosis because the patient's lesion is not consistent with a pressure ulcer. Pressure ulcers are typically found over bony prominences and are caused by prolonged pressure and ischemia. The patient's lesion is a circular, crusted papule with a surrounding rim of erythema, which is not consistent with a pressure ulcer.

C, Neonatal lupus erythematosus, is also not a likely diagnosis because the patient's symptoms do not match the characteristic features of neonatal lupus erythematosus. Neonatal lupus erythematosus is a rare condition that occurs in infants of mothers with systemic lupus erythematosus and is characterized by a distinctive rash, liver and kidney involvement, and a high risk of infection. The patient's lesion is not consistent with the characteristic rash of neonatal lupus erythematosus, and there is no evidence of liver or kidney involvement.

D, Ecthyma gangrenosum, is not a likely diagnosis because the patient's lesion does not have the characteristic features of ecthyma gangrenosum. Ecthyma gangrenosum is a rare condition that is associated with sepsis and is characterized by small, painless, purple spots on the skin that progress

The patient's symptoms of worsening abdominal pain, persistent pruritus, and scleral icterus, along with the physical examination findings of jaundice, scleral icterus, and a fixed right supraclavicular lymph node conglomerate, suggest a diagnosis of vanishing bile duct syndrome. This is a rare condition characterized by the progressive destruction of small intrahepatic bile ducts, leading to cholestasis and jaundice.

The patient's history of moderate alcohol consumption and negative human immunodeficiency virus test results make acute hepatitis associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection (choice A) less likely. Sarcoidosis (choice C) is also unlikely given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, as sarcoidosis typically presents with skin lesions, pulmonary symptoms, and lymphadenopathy.

Metastatic cholangiocarcinoma secondary to primary sclerosing cholangitis (choice D) is unlikely given the patient's age and lack of history of primary sclerosing cholangitis. Additionally, the liver biopsy results shown in Figure 1 are not consistent with cholangiocarcinoma.

The patient's history of persistent pruritus and the presence of a large extracardiac mass abutting the left atrium suggest a diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma. The liver biopsy results, which show a portal tract containing both hepatic artery and hepatic vein branches, are consistent with vanishing bile duct syndrome associated with Hodgkin lymphoma.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Vanishing bile duct syndrome associated with Hodgkin lymphoma.

**Answer**:C. Gastric metastasis of Merkel cell carcinoma

The correct answer is C. Gastric metastasis of Merkel cell carcinoma, as it is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's history and the results of the imaging studies.

A. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is an unlikely diagnosis, as the patient's age and the location of the mass in the gastric fundus are not typical for GIST. Additionally, the presence of a metabolically active mass on positron emission tomography (PET) and the intense uptake of 68Ga-DOTATOC suggest a neuroendocrine tumor rather than a GIST.

B. Type III neuroendocrine tumor of the stomach is also an unlikely diagnosis, as the patient's history of Merkel cell carcinoma and the presence of metastasis in the lymph nodes along the lesser curvature of the stomach suggest a metastatic lesion rather than a primary neuroendocrine tumor.

D. Gastric adenocarcinoma is a possible diagnosis, but it is less likely than gastric metastasis of Merkel cell carcinoma given the patient's history and the imaging findings. The presence of a mass in the gastric fundus and the enlarged lymph nodes along the lesser curvature are more consistent with metastasis than a primary adenocarcinoma.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is C. Gastric metastasis of Merkel cell carcinoma.

**Answer**: C. Hydatid cyst of the pancreas

The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and dysuria, along with the incidental finding of a mass in the tail of the pancreas on a CT scan, suggest a possible pancreatic cyst. Hydatid cysts are a type of parasitic infection caused by the larvae of Echinococcus granulosus, which can infect various organs including the pancreas.

The patient's history of a similar episode that improved spontaneously, along with the absence of any clinical abnormalities on physical examination, suggest that the cyst may have been present for some time and has been causing intermittent symptoms. The patient's family history of a pancreatic carcinoma in his father also increases the likelihood of a pancreatic cyst.

The laboratory values, including cancer antigen 19-9 and carcinoembryonic antigen levels, being normal, also support the diagnosis of a hydatid cyst, as these values are often elevated in pancreatic cancer.

The CT scan findings of a 10 × 10 × 8-cm mass in the tail of the pancreas and thrombosis of the splenic vein are consistent with a hydatid cyst. The presence of a 4-mm kidney stone on the right side and a slightly congested right kidney also support the diagnosis of a hydatid cyst, as kidney stones and hydatid cysts can coexist.

The other answer choices are less likely given the patient's symptoms and CT scan findings. Cystadenoma is a benign pancreatic tumor that is rare and typically presents with abdominal pain, weight loss, and obstructive jaundice, which are not present in this case.

**Answer**: D. Metastatic carcinoma

The patient's symptoms of intermittent epigastric pain, palpitations, and hot flashes, along with the echocardiogram and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings of multiple intramyocardial masses involving the left ventricle, aortopulmonary window lymphadenopathy, and moderate pericardial effusion, suggest a diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma. The patient's history of a previous ovarian cyst and cosmetic breast augmentation increases the likelihood of a primary cancer in the breast or ovary, which has spread to the heart.

The patient's age and smoking history also increase the likelihood of a primary lung cancer, which could have metastasized to the heart. The absence of discrete masses or lymphadenopathy elsewhere in the body, as revealed by computed tomographic imaging, supports the diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma.

A transcutaneous biopsy of the left ventricular mass was nondiagnostic, which is not uncommon in cases of metastatic carcinoma. Therefore, option D, Metastatic carcinoma, is the most likely diagnosis.

Option A, Lymphoma, is less likely as the patient does not have a history of lymphoma, and the echocardiogram and cardiac MRI findings do not suggest a lymphoma diagnosis.

Option B, Melanoma, is also less likely as the patient does not have a history of melanoma, and the skin examination did not reveal any suspicious lesions.

Option C, Rhabdomyoma, is a rare benign tumor that usually affects the heart in children and young adults. It is unlikely in this case given the patient's age and the presence of multiple intramyocardial masses.

Therefore, option D, Metastatic carcinoma, is the most appropriate answer.

**Answer**:B. Obtain a skin biopsy.

The patient's symptoms of a generalized nonpruritic, nontender rash, without fevers or other constitutional symptoms, and laboratory evaluation of pancytopenia, suggest a possible adverse effect of trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody used to treat breast cancer. The appearance of red-brown plaques and papules on the chest, abdomen, back, and limbs, is consistent with a cutaneous reaction associated with trastuzumab.

Option B, Obtain a skin biopsy, is the correct answer because it would allow for a definitive diagnosis of the cutaneous reaction, and would guide further management. A skin biopsy would also help to rule out other potential causes of the rash, such as a fungal or bacterial infection.

Option A, Discontinue trastuzumab, may be considered, but it is not the most appropriate next step. Discontinuing the medication without a definitive diagnosis may not address the underlying cause of the rash, and may compromise the patient's cancer treatment.

Option C, Prescribe topical steroids, may provide some symptomatic relief for the patient's rash, but it would not address the underlying cause of the reaction. Topical steroids may also not be effective in treating a cutaneous reaction associated with trastuzumab.

**Answer**:C. Perform a punch biopsy and send for bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacillary cultures

The correct answer is C. Perform a punch biopsy and send for bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacillary cultures. This is because the patient's symptoms of gradually worsening swelling and itching in the red ink area of the tattoo, along with the physical examination findings of marked swelling and keloid formation, suggest a possible infection or inflammatory response. A punch biopsy would allow for a tissue sample to be collected and sent for cultures to determine if there is an infection, and if so, what type of organism is causing it. This information would be important in guiding further treatment.

Option A, prescribing oral antibiotics, may be appropriate if an infection is suspected, but it is not the most appropriate step at this point in the patient's care. Antibiotics should only be prescribed after a definitive diagnosis of infection has been made, and not based solely on symptoms.

Option B, prescribing higher-potency topical steroids, may be appropriate for treating inflammation or an allergic reaction, but it is not the most appropriate step at this point in the patient's care. The patient has already tried topical hydrocortisone cream with no benefit, and the symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a more serious underlying condition that requires further evaluation.

Option D, reassuring the patient and following up in 2 weeks, may be appropriate after further evaluation and treatment have been initiated, but it is not the most appropriate step at this point in the patient's care. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a possible infection or inflammatory response that requires further evaluation and treatment. Simply reassuring the patient and following up in 2 weeks without further evaluation and treatment may not address the underlying condition and may lead to further complications.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is C: The patient’s probability of prostate cancer is approximately 6% for a high-grade cancer and 18% for a low-grade cancer.

Let's go through each answer choice and explain why they are incorrect:

A: The patient’s slow rise in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and enlarged prostate are consistent with benign prostatic hyperplasia, and his probability of prostate cancer is less than 10%.

This choice is incorrect because the patient's PSA level has been steadily rising over the past few years, which is a concerning sign for prostate cancer. While an enlarged prostate can be a sign of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), it's also a common finding in prostate cancer. Therefore, it's important to further evaluate the patient's PSA level and perform additional tests to determine the cause of the rise in PSA.

B: The patient’s rise in PSA level means his probability of prostate cancer is more than 50%.

This choice is incorrect because the patient's PSA level has been rising, but it's still within the normal range. A PSA level below 4 ng/mL is considered normal, and the patient's latest PSA level is 3.9 ng/mL. While a rising PSA level is a concern, it's important to note that not all patients with a rising PSA level have prostate cancer.

D: Variability in the patient’s PSA level makes it likely the tests were done in different laboratories.

This choice is incorrect because there's no evidence to suggest that the patient's PSA tests were done in different laboratories. The patient's PSA history is displayed in the table, and all the tests were performed at the same laboratory.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: The patient’s probability of prostate cancer is approximately 6% for a high-grade cancer and 18% for a low-grade cancer. This answer choice takes into account the patient's rising PSA level, enlarged prostate, and the fact that not all patients with a rising PSA level have prostate cancer. It's important to perform

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is B: Further testing is needed because of the ST depressions during recovery.

ST depressions, or changes in the ST segment of the electrocardiogram (ECG), can be an indication of coronary artery disease (CAD). In this case, the patient had ST depressions during recovery, which suggests that there may be a problem with blood flow to the heart muscle. This is a concerning sign and warrants further testing to determine the cause.

Now, let's look at the other answer choices and why they are incorrect:

A: Further testing is unnecessary because the patient is asymptomatic and has high exercise capacity.

While it's true that the patient is asymptomatic and has a high exercise capacity, the presence of ST depressions during recovery suggests that there may still be a problem with blood flow to the heart muscle. Therefore, further testing is needed to rule out any potential issues.

C: Further testing is unnecessary because ST depressions are not significant unless 2 mm or greater.

This statement is incorrect. ST depressions of any magnitude can be a sign of CAD, and it's important to investigate further to determine the cause. The magnitude of the ST depression is just one factor that healthcare providers consider when interpreting the results of an exercise treadmill test.

D: Further testing is needed because inferolateral ST depressions indicate obstructive coronary artery disease in the right coronary artery, the left circumflex artery, or both arteries.

This statement is also incorrect. Inferolateral ST depressions can indicate obstructive CAD, but they don't necessarily indicate which specific coronary artery is affected. Further testing would be needed to determine the specific location and severity of any blockages.

In summary, the correct answer is B: Further testing is needed because of the ST depressions during recovery. This is because ST depressions can be a sign of CAD, and further testing is needed to determine the cause of the depressions and rule out any potential issues.

**Answer**: B. Demodex folliculorum–associated spinulosus

The correct answer is B, Demodex folliculorum–associated spinulosus, because the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with this diagnosis.

Demodex folliculorum is a type of Demodex mite that infests the pilosebaceous unit and causes a condition called demodicosis. Demodicosis can cause a variety of skin symptoms, including rough, sandpapery skin, which is the primary complaint of the patient in this case. The patient's history of polycythemia vera and acute myelogenous leukemia increases the likelihood of Demodex infestation, as these conditions are associated with an increased risk of developing demodicosis.

The patient's physical examination findings, including background erythema with numerous rough horny spicules at the follicular ostia on her face, ears, and neck, and the upper part of her chest, are also consistent with Demodex infestation. The presence of pigmented macules on her right cheek, which are not typical of demodicosis, may be due to another condition or a side effect of her medications.

The other answer choices are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

A, Trichodysplasia spinulosa–associated polyomavirus, is a rare condition caused by a virus that affects the hair follicles and leads to the formation of spinous and filiform papillae. It is not associated with Demodex infestation or the patient's medical history.

C, Ulerythema ophryogenes, is a rare condition characterized by inflammation of the hair follicles and the development of large, painful nodules on the scalp. It is not associated with Demodex infestation or the patient's medical history.

**Answer**: D. Cutaneous diphtheria

Explanation:
Cutaneous diphtheria is a rare complication of diphtheria that occurs when the bacteria producing the toxin enter the skin, causing ulceration and necrosis. The patient's history of traveling to Pakistan, where diphtheria is endemic, and the presence of painful ulcerated lesions with a grayish membrane on the dorsal aspect of his feet, are consistent with cutaneous diphtheria. The absence of signs of lymphangitis or lymphadenopathy also supports this diagnosis, as cutaneous diphtheria typically does not involve the lymphatic system.

The other options are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms:

A. Cutaneous tuberculosis: Tuberculosis can cause skin lesions, but they are typically not ulcerated or painful. The presence of a grayish membrane and the absence of signs of lymphangitis or lymphadenopathy make tuberculosis less likely.

B. Ecthyma gangrenosum: Ecthyma gangrenosum is a skin infection caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa that typically occurs in immunocompromised patients. The patient's history of traveling to Pakistan and the absence of signs of immunocompromise make this diagnosis less likely.

C. Leishmaniasis: Leishmaniasis is a parasitic infection that can cause skin lesions, but the ulcerated and painful lesions with a grayish membrane are not typical of this condition. Additionally, the patient's history of traveling to Pakistan, where leishmaniasis is endemic, and the absence of signs of lymphangitis or lymphadenopathy, make leishmaniasis less likely.

Therefore, based on the patient's history, symptoms, and physical examination findings, cutaneous diphtheria is the most likely diagnosis.

**Answer**: C. GM1 gangliosidosis

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, such as multiple polycyclic brownish to reddish macules on the skin, coarse facial features, hepatomegaly, lumbar kyphosis, and muscular hypotonia, are consistent with GM1 gangliosidosis. This is a genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme beta-galactosidase, which leads to the accumulation of gangliosides in various tissues, including the skin and central nervous system. The characteristic skin lesions are described as "polycyclic" and "brownish to reddish," which is consistent with the patient's presentation. Additionally, the presence of hepatomegaly and lumbar kyphosis are also common features of GM1 gangliosidosis.

The other answer choices do not fit the patient's symptoms as well. Child abuse (A) is unlikely given the presence of other systemic symptoms and the absence of any history of trauma. Morquio syndrome (B) is a different genetic disorder that affects the metabolism of sulfatides and leads to a different set of symptoms, including short stature, joint stiffness, and corneal clouding. Hurler-Scheie syndrome (D) is also a different genetic disorder that affects the metabolism of glycosaminoglycans and leads to a different set of symptoms, including short stature, joint stiffness, and corneal clouding.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, the most likely diagnosis is GM1 gangliosidosis, which is answer C.

**Answer**:D. Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder

The patient's symptoms of subacute imbalance, gait dysfunction, confusion, and urinary tract infection, along with the imaging findings of mass lesions on the brain, are consistent with posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). PTLD is a complication that can occur after organ transplantation, and it is caused by an overactive immune response to the transplanted organ.

Option A, central nervous system toxoplasmosis, is unlikely because the patient does not have a history of toxoplasma infection, and the imaging findings do not suggest this diagnosis.

Option B, metastatic carcinoma, is also unlikely because the patient does not have a history of cancer, and the imaging findings do not suggest this diagnosis.

Option C, central nervous system lymphoma, is a possibility, but it is less likely than PTLD given the patient's history of immunosuppression and the imaging findings.

Therefore, the correct answer is D, Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder.

**Answer**:C. Perform magnetic resonance (MR) imaging of the brain and spine

The patient's symptoms of monocular nystagmus and failure to thrive, along with the physical examination findings of an emaciated appearance, rapid pendular horizontal nystagmus, and normal optokinetic responses, suggest a possible diagnosis of a suprasellar mass. The patient's history of normal growth and development until 3 months of age, followed by a rapid decline in weight, suggests that the suprasellar mass may have developed recently. The absence of any other neurological signs, such as strabismus, head nodding, or torticollis, also supports this diagnosis.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine is the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic evaluation of this patient. MRI can help to confirm the presence of a suprasellar mass and provide additional information about its size, location, and relationship to surrounding structures. MRI can also help to identify any other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a brainstem or spinal cord lesion.

Electrooculography (EOG) (choice A) may be useful in evaluating the patient's nystagmus, but it is not the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic evaluation of this patient. EOG can help to determine the type and extent of the nystagmus, but it cannot provide information about the underlying cause of the nystagmus.

Visual evoked potential (VEP) testing (choice B) may also be useful in evaluating the patient's visual system, but it is not the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic evaluation of this patient. VEP testing can help to assess the function of the visual pathway, but it cannot provide information about the presence or location of a suprasellar mass.

Blood culture (choice D) is not relevant to the patient's symptoms or physical examination findings and is therefore not an appropriate next step in the diagnostic evaluation of this patient.

In summary, the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic evaluation of this patient is MRI of the brain and spine to confirm the presence of a suprasellar mass and provide additional

**Answer**:D. Perform pars plana vitrectomy with intravitreous methotrexate

Explanation:

A. Consult infectious diseases for alternative antitubercular therapy:
This choice is incorrect because the patient has already been treated for tuberculosis with antitubercular therapy, and the current symptoms are related to the complications of corticosteroid use. Consulting infectious diseases for alternative antitubercular therapy may not address the underlying cause of the patient's current symptoms.

B. Initiate corticosteroid-sparing immunosuppressive therapy:
This choice is incorrect because the patient has already experienced complications from corticosteroid use, and initiating immunosuppressive therapy may further increase the risk of infection and other adverse effects.

C. Inject intravitreous triamcinolone acetonide:
This choice is incorrect because the patient has already had a complicated course with corticosteroid use, and injecting intravitreous triamcinolone acetonide may further increase the risk of complications, such as cataract formation, glaucoma, and recurrent inflammation.

D. Perform pars plana vitrectomy with intravitreous methotrexate:
This choice is correct because it addresses the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, which is the large choroidal tuberculoma. Vitrectomy with intravitreous methotrexate can help to remove the tuberculoma and reduce the risk of recurrence. Methotrexate is a chemotherapeutic agent that has been shown to be effective in treating ocular tuberculosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Perform pars plana vitrectomy with intravitreous methotrexate.

**Answer**: C. Orf

Explanation:

Orf (also known as ecthyma contagiosum) is a viral infection that affects sheep, goats, and occasionally humans. It is caused by a parapoxvirus and is transmitted through direct contact with infected animals or contaminated fomites. The virus enters the body through skin lesions or mucous membranes and causes a localized infection.

The patient's history of biting her nails and injuring her hand on a metal fence at home suggests that she may have introduced the virus into her body through a small cut or abrasion. The lesion on her thumb is consistent with the characteristic erythematous, crusted, and painless appearance of orf. The presence of tender lymphadenopathy in the right axilla is also consistent with orf, as the virus can cause lymphadenitis.

Herpetic whitlow (choice A) is a viral infection caused by the herpes simplex virus that affects the fingers and thumbs. It is characterized by the presence of multiple small, painful vesicles on the affected digit. While herpetic whitlow can cause lymphadenopathy, it is less likely to cause a single, well-defined pustule like the one described in the patient's thumb.

Cutaneous anthrax (choice B) is a bacterial infection caused by Bacillus anthracis that can affect the skin. It is characterized by the presence of a painless, edematous, and vesiculating lesion with a surrounding erythematous ring. While cutaneous anthrax can cause lymphadenopathy, it is less likely to cause a single, well-defined pustule like the one described in the patient's thumb.

Sporotrichosis (choice D) is a fungal infection caused by Sporothrix schenckii that affects the skin and lymphatic system. It is characterized by the presence of a painless, erythematous, and nodular lesion that may ulcerate. While sporotrichosis can cause lymphadenopathy, it is less likely to cause a single, well-defined pustule

**Answer**: C. True vocal fold myxoma

The patient's symptoms of sudden-onset, progressively worsening dysphonia, dry cough, and sensation of a lump in the throat, along with the objective findings of a broad-based submucosal mass in the anterior two-thirds of the right true vocal fold, are consistent with a diagnosis of a true vocal fold myxoma. The location and size of the mass, as well as its disruption of vocal fold vibration, support this diagnosis.

True vocal fold myxomas are rare, benign tumors that arise from the mesenchymal cells of the vocal fold. They are typically slow-growing and may not cause symptoms until they have reached a certain size or have been present for a long time. The patient's history of a 5-month duration of symptoms and the lack of any identifiable cause for his symptoms suggest that a myxoma is a likely diagnosis.

The other answer choices are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and clinical findings.

A. True vocal fold polyp: A polyp is a growth that arises from the epithelial surface of the vocal fold. While it can cause similar symptoms to a myxoma, such as dysphonia and cough, it is typically smaller and more superficial than a myxoma. The patient's symptoms and the size and location of the mass are not consistent with a polyp.

B. Vocal fold squamous cell carcinoma: Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that can arise in the vocal fold. It is more common in smokers and is often associated with a history of vocal cord dysplasia. The patient's lack of smoking history and the absence of any other symptoms or findings suggestive of cancer make squamous cell carcinoma less likely.

**Answer**:C. Nasal angioleiomyoma

The correct answer is C. Nasal angioleiomyoma because it is a benign tumor that originates from the nasal cavity and is composed of abnormal blood vessels and smooth muscle cells. The patient's symptoms of recurrent epistaxis and the presence of a soft-tissue mass in the left nasal cavity are consistent with this diagnosis.

Angiomyolipoma (A) is a rare benign tumor that is composed of abnormal blood vessels, smooth muscle cells, and fat cells. It is typically found in the nasal cavity, but it can also occur in other parts of the head and neck. However, it is not the most likely diagnosis for this patient's symptoms and findings.

Angiofibroma (B) is a benign tumor that is composed of abnormal blood vessels and fibrous tissue. It is commonly found in the nasal cavity and can cause symptoms such as nasal obstruction, bleeding, and discharge. However, it is not typically associated with recurrent epistaxis or a soft-tissue mass in the nasal cavity.

Hemangioma (D) is a benign tumor that is composed of abnormal blood vessels. It can occur in various parts of the body, including the nasal cavity. However, it is not typically associated with recurrent epistaxis or a soft-tissue mass in the nasal cavity.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and findings, the most likely diagnosis is C. Nasal angioleiomyoma.

Sure! Here's my explanation:

**Answer**: C. Esthesioneuroblastoma

The patient's symptoms of dizziness, vomiting, unstable gait, and headaches, along with the laboratory evaluation revealing a sodium level of 109 mEq/L, suggest a diagnosis of hyponatremia. The presence of a mass in the right maxillary sinus with extension into the infundibulum, as shown on the MRI, and the patient's persistent hyponatremia despite correction of the sodium level, suggest a possible diagnosis of a sinonasal tumor causing hyponatremia.

The histopathological features described in the question, including a small, round, blue-cell tumor growing in circumscribed lobules and nests separated by vascularized fibrous stroma, with uniform, small, round nuclei and scant cytoplasm, are consistent with a diagnosis of esthesioneuroblastoma. The positive staining for synaptophysin and negative staining for cytokeratin also support this diagnosis.

Inverted papilloma (choice A) is a benign tumor that arises from the epithelium of the nasal cavity or paranasal sinuses. It is typically slow-growing and does not cause hyponatremia. Fungal ball (choice B) is a benign mass that results from the accumulation of fungal organisms in the sinuses. It is not associated with hyponatremia. Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (choice D) is a malignant tumor that can arise in the nasal cavity or paranasal sinuses. It can cause hyponatremia, but the histopathological features described in the question are not consistent with this diagnosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Esthesioneuroblastoma.

**Answer**: C. Tuberculous lymphadenitis

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, as well as the imaging results, suggest cervical lymphadenopathy with central necrosis, which is consistent with tuberculous lymphadenitis. Tuberculous lymphadenitis is an infection of the lymph nodes by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which can cause swollen and painful lymph nodes, especially in the neck. The patient's history of a distant history of breast cancer and a recent history of an oral cavity lesion, which was not biopsied or followed up, increases the likelihood of a diagnosis of tuberculous lymphadenitis.

Squamous cell carcinoma (choice A) is a type of cancer that can affect the lymph nodes, but it is less likely in this case because the patient does not have a history of exposure to carcinogens, and there is no evidence of skin lesions or ulcers in the oral cavity.

Lymphoma (choice B) is a type of cancer that affects the immune system and can cause lymphadenopathy, but it is less likely in this case because the patient does not have a history of immunodeficiency or exposure to carcinogens, and there is no evidence of systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, or weight loss.

Papillary thyroid carcinoma (choice D) is a type of cancer that affects the thyroid gland and can cause cervical lymphadenopathy, but it is less likely in this case because the patient does not have a history of thyroid disease or symptoms such as hoarseness or difficulty swallowing, and there is no evidence of a thyroid mass on physical examination or imaging.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and imaging results, the most likely diagnosis is tuberculous lymphadenitis.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is B: Aberrant internal carotid artery.

An aberrant internal carotid artery is a rare congenital anomaly where the internal carotid artery takes an abnormal course, often through the retropharyngeal space. This is exactly what is seen in the provided images, where the right internal carotid artery is deviated medially and courses through the retropharyngeal space, which is not its normal location. This anomaly can cause symptoms such as dysphagia, odynophagia, and respiratory symptoms, which are consistent with the patient's presentation.

Now, let's discuss why the other answer choices are incorrect:

A: Arteriovenous malformation of the oropharynx.

An arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is a congenital vascular anomaly characterized by a tangle of abnormal blood vessels. While AVMs can occur in the oropharynx, the provided images do not show the characteristic features of an AVM, such as a tangled, irregular vascular structure. Instead, the images show a single, aberrant vessel, which is consistent with an aberrant internal carotid artery.

C: Cavernous hemangioma of the oropharynx.

A cavernous hemangioma is a benign vascular tumor that can occur in various parts of the body, including the oropharynx. However, cavernous hemangiomas are typically well-circumscribed and do not have the same aberrant vessel course as seen in the provided images. Additionally, the patient's symptoms of dysphagia and odynophagia are not typically seen in cavernous hemangioma.

D: Internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysm.

A pseudoaneurysm is a dilatation of a blood vessel that occurs due to a weakening of the vessel wall.

**Answer**: C. Hypophysitis

The correct answer is C. Hypophysitis, and the explanation for each choice is as follows:

A. Neurosarcoid: This choice is incorrect because there is no evidence of sarcoidosis in the patient's history or physical examination. Sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects various organs, including the brain, and typically presents with symptoms such as headaches, fatigue, and vision changes. While the patient in this case does have headaches and fatigue, there is no evidence to suggest that these symptoms are caused by sarcoidosis.

B. Melanoma metastasis: This choice is incorrect because there is no evidence of melanoma metastasis to the brain. The patient has advanced melanoma, but the symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest brain metastasis. The patient's symptoms are more consistent with hypophysitis, which is inflammation of the pituitary gland.

D. Pituitary macroadenoma: This choice is incorrect because there is no evidence of a pituitary macroadenoma. A pituitary macroadenoma is a large tumor that arises from the pituitary gland and can cause symptoms such as headaches, visual disturbances, and hormonal imbalances. While the patient in this case does have headaches and hormonal imbalances, there is no evidence to suggest that these symptoms are caused by a pituitary macroadenoma.

C. Hypophysitis: This choice is correct because the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with hypophysitis. Hypophysitis is inflammation of the pituitary gland, which can cause symptoms such as headaches, fatigue, and hormonal imbalances. The patient's low corticotropin and testosterone levels, as well as the MRI findings, are consistent with hypophysitis. The patient's history of melanoma and treatment with ipilimumab also increase the likelihood of hypophysitis, as immune-related adverse events are known to occur with this treatment. Therefore, C.

**Answer**:C. Anal adenocarcinoma

The correct answer is C. Anal adenocarcinoma because it matches the patient's symptoms and test results.

A. Giant perianal abscess is unlikely because the patient did not report any signs of infection such as fever, chills, or redness in the affected area. Additionally, the patient's symptoms have been present for 1 year, which is not consistent with the sudden onset of an abscess.

B. Giant condyloma is not likely because the patient did not report any history of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection or genital warts. Moreover, condylomas are typically slow-growing and do not cause significant pain or bleeding.

D. Anal squamous cell carcinoma is a possibility, but it is less likely than anal adenocarcinoma given the patient's symptoms and test results. Anal squamous cell carcinoma typically presents with bleeding, pain, and a mass, but it is more commonly found in older adults and has a longer history of progression.

C. Anal adenocarcinoma is the most likely diagnosis because it matches the patient's symptoms of painful anal bleeding, fecal incontinence, and a mass in the anal canal. The patient's history of smoking and age also increase the likelihood of this diagnosis. The fact that the patient has not had any previous abdominal surgery or a history of sexually transmitted diseases also supports this diagnosis. The patient's normal blood and liver function test results and negative results for carcinoembryonic antigen and cancer antigen 19-9 also support this diagnosis, as anal adenocarcinoma typically does not cause significant systemic symptoms or elevated tumor markers. The patient's symptoms and test results are consistent with the diagnosis of anal adenocarcinoma, which is a malignancy that arises from the glandular cells lining the anal canal.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain why D. Gossypiboma is the correct answer and why the other choices are incorrect.

**Answer**: D. Gossypiboma

Gossypiboma is a rare benign tumor that originates from the remnants of the umbilical cord. It typically presents as a mass in the abdomen or pelvis, and can mimic other types of tumors, such as liver cancer. In this case, the patient had a history of a cesarean section, which increases the risk of developing a gossypiboma. The patient's age and lack of symptoms also support this diagnosis, as gossypiboma typically affects women in their reproductive years and can be asymptomatic.

The imaging findings also support the diagnosis of gossypiboma. The mass is described as being well-defined, solid, and heterogeneous, with no enhancement and no liquid component. This is consistent with the typical imaging features of a gossypiboma, which can appear as a well-circumscribed mass with variable density.

The other choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.

A. Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a primary liver cancer that can present with a liver mass, but it is unlikely in this case given the patient's age and lack of risk factors. HCC is more common in men and patients with cirrhosis or liver disease, and typically presents with symptoms such as abdominal pain, fatigue, and weight loss.

B. Fibrolamellar carcinoma is a rare type of liver cancer that can also present with a liver mass, but it is unlikely in this case given the patient's age and lack of symptoms. Fibrolamellar carcinoma typically affects younger patients and can present with symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, and fever.

**Answer**:B. Discontinue pantoprazole

The patient's history of pulmonary sarcoidosis and the presence of a widespread scaly rash suggest a possible diagnosis of cutaneous sarcoidosis. Cutaneous sarcoidosis can present with a variety of skin lesions, including annular and polycyclic scaly patches, as seen in this patient. The patient's history of hypertension, diabetes, and chronic renal insufficiency may also be relevant to the patient's overall health and potential treatment plan, but they are not directly related to the likely diagnosis of cutaneous sarcoidosis.

The patient's medication regimen includes pantoprazole, which is a proton pump inhibitor commonly used to treat gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). However, pantoprazole has been associated with a rare but potentially serious side effect known as drug-induced subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE). SCLE is a form of cutaneous lupus that can cause a scaly, itchy rash, and may be triggered by certain medications, including proton pump inhibitors. The patient's widespread scaly rash and positive antinuclear antibodies (ANA) titer with a speckled pattern suggest the possibility of drug-induced SCLE.

Therefore, the best next step would be to discontinue pantoprazole (choice B) and monitor the patient's skin rash for improvement. If the rash does not improve or worsens, further evaluation, such as a skin biopsy or blood tests for autoantibodies, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of drug-induced SCLE.

The other choices are not the best next steps for the following reasons:

A. Obtaining a chest radiograph to evaluate progression of sarcoidosis may be relevant for monitoring the patient's pulmonary sarcoidosis, but it is not directly related to the patient's skin rash or the potential diagnosis of drug-induced SCLE.

C. Starting oral prednisone may be appropriate if the patient's skin rash is severe or persistent, but

The correct answer is A because the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with hyperprolactinemia caused by a nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma. The patient's persistent fatigue, vision loss, and low libido are all symptoms of hyperprolactinemia. The laboratory results show low serum testosterone and thyrotropin levels, which are consistent with hyperprolactinemia. The elevated serum prolactin levels further support this diagnosis.

The patient's lack of acromegalic features, gynecomastia, galactorrhea, or abnormal virilization suggests that the hyperprolactinemia is not caused by a prolactinoma (choice D). Prolactinomas are typically associated with these features.

Choice B, hyperprolactinemia due to thyroid disease, is unlikely because the patient's thyrotropin levels are low, indicating that the thyroid gland is not overactive.

Choice C, sertraline-induced hyperprolactinemia, is also unlikely because the patient's symptoms began 2 months ago, and sertraline was started 15 years ago. It is unlikely that the medication would cause a delayed onset of hyperprolactinemia.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma causing hyperprolactinemia, which is choice A.

**Answer**:B. Obtain a detailed procedural history

The patient's recurrent painful abdominal rash, with no identifiable cause, suggests a possible underlying autoimmune or connective tissue disorder. Obtaining a detailed procedural history can help identify any previous surgeries, medical procedures, or medications that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. This information can also help the clinician determine if the patient has a history of autoimmune or connective tissue disorders, which could be relevant to the patient's current condition.

A. Ordering laboratory studies for antinuclear, anti-Scl-70, and anti-centromere antibodies may be appropriate, but it is not the most appropriate next step. While these tests can help diagnose certain autoimmune disorders, they are not specific to the patient's symptoms and may not provide a clear diagnosis.

C. Performing patch testing for a possible contact allergen may not be relevant to the patient's symptoms, as there is no mention of any skin lesions or rashes that would suggest an allergic reaction.

D. Obtaining a skin swab for varicella zoster virus direct fluorescent antibody level may be appropriate if the patient had a history of shingles or other viral infections, but it is not directly related to the patient's current symptoms.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to obtain a detailed procedural history to help identify any potential underlying causes of the patient's symptoms.

**Answer**: B. Septic emboli

The correct answer is B. Septic emboli because the patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a septic embolic event. Septic emboli occur when bacteria or other microorganisms enter the bloodstream and travel to a distant site in the body, causing a blockage or inflammation in the affected blood vessel.

The patient's history of end-stage renal disease and coronary artery disease increases her risk of developing septic emboli. The presence of purpuric lesions on the skin, particularly on the ankle, is consistent with septic emboli. The laboratory findings of neutrophil-predominant leukocytosis also support this diagnosis, as it suggests an inflammatory response to the presence of bacteria in the bloodstream.

The punch biopsy specimens obtained from the border of normal and lesional skin showed partial necrosis of the epidermis with intraepidermal bulla formation, marked perivascular infiltrates in the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue, and a small blood vessel occluded with fibrinoid material with a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate. These findings are consistent with the histopathological changes seen in septic emboli.

In contrast, choice A, Calciphylaxis, is a rare condition characterized by the deposition of calcium in the skin and other organs, leading to skin necrosis and ulceration. While calciphylaxis can present with similar skin lesions, it is not associated with a septic embolic event.

Choice C, Vasculitis, is an inflammatory condition that affects blood vessels and can cause skin lesions. However, the presence of purpuric lesions and the patient's history of end-stage renal disease and coronary artery disease make septic emboli a more likely diagnosis.

Choice D, Necrotizing fasciitis, is a severe bacterial infection that affects the subcutaneous tissue and can cause skin necrosis. However, the patient's symptoms and labor

**Answer**: C. Lichen planus actinicus

Lichen planus actinicus is a rare variant of lichen planus that is characterized by the development of violaceous or hyperpigmented lesions on sun-exposed areas, particularly on the hands, feet, and face. The condition typically affects middle-aged individuals, and men are more likely to be affected than women.

The clinical presentation of lichen planus actinicus is consistent with the patient's symptoms, as described in the case. The patient presented with violaceous papules on the dorsal aspect of his hands, extensor surface of his arms, and the nape of his neck, which are all typical locations for lichen planus actinicus lesions. Additionally, the patient had hyperpigmented annular plaques with violaceous borders on his scalp, which is also a common feature of lichen planus actinicus.

Histopathological examination of a skin biopsy specimen revealed a lymphocytic infiltrate at the dermoepidermal junction, which is a characteristic feature of lichen planus actinicus.

In contrast, discoid lupus erythematosus (choice A) is a chronic autoimmune disease that is characterized by the development of scaly, crusted, and hyperpigmented lesions on the skin, particularly on the face, scalp, and ears. While discoid lupus erythematosus can present with violaceous lesions, the distribution of the lesions and the presence of scaling and crusting are not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

Erythema dyschromicum perstans (choice B) is a rare condition that presents with irregular, asymmetrical, and poorly defined hyperpigmented macules on the skin, particularly on the face, neck, and extremities. While erythema dyschromicum perstans can present with violaceous lesions, the distribution and shape of the lesions are not consistent with the patient's symptoms.

**Answer**: A. Pemphigus erythematosus

Pemphigus erythematosus is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the skin and mucous membranes. It is characterized by the formation of blisters and sores on the skin and mucous membranes, which can be painful and tender. The disease is caused by the production of autoantibodies that target the cells that hold the skin together, leading to the breakdown of the skin's basement membrane.

In this case, the patient presented with pruritic, pink scaling plaques on the face and neck that subsequently involved the chest, abdomen, and back. The lesions flared with sun exposure, which is consistent with the photodistributed pattern seen in pemphigus erythematosus. The patient's medical history of pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis also increases the likelihood of this diagnosis, as pemphigus erythematosus is associated with an increased risk of thrombotic events.

The laboratory findings also support this diagnosis, as the patient had positive antinuclear antibody titers and lymphopenia, which are commonly seen in pemphigus erythematosus. The negative results for antiribonucleoprotein, antihistone, antiphospholipid, anti-Smith, anti-Ro/Sjögren syndrome antigen A, and anti-La/Sjögren syndrome antigen B antibodies, C3, C4, CH50, rapid plasma reagin, and creatinine; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; and a comprehensive metabolic profile, as well as the normal urinalysis results, also suggest that this is not a case of lupus erythematosus.

The biopsy findings, which showed a subepidermal blister with an inflammatory infiltrate and a positive direct immunofluorescence study for IgG and C3 at the dermal-epidermal junction, are also consistent with pemphigus erythematosus.

**Answer**:C. Check laboratory results and add IV penicillin G

The patient's symptoms of bilateral redness, blurred vision, and photophobia, along with the physical examination findings of bilateral vitritis, hyperemic optic nerves, and extensive whitening of the retina, are consistent with a diagnosis of retinitis. The patient's history of HIV infection and recent initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) suggest that the retinitis is likely caused by an opportunistic infection.

The laboratory workup for infectious causes, which was obtained before starting treatment, is crucial in determining the specific cause of the retinitis. The patient's recent history of HIV infection and immune reactivation syndrome increases the likelihood of an opportunistic infection, such as Cryptococcus or Toxoplasma, which can cause retinitis.

Therefore, choice C, "Check laboratory results and add IV penicillin G," is the correct answer. The addition of IV penicillin G would provide coverage for potential bacterial infections, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae, which can cause retinitis in patients with HIV infection.

Choice A, "Continue the same treatment," is incorrect because the patient's condition did not improve after 48 hours of treatment with IV acyclovir sodium and prednisone. This suggests that the current treatment regimen is not effective in managing the patient's retinitis.

Choice B, "Increase the dose of corticosteroids," is also incorrect. While corticosteroids can be used to reduce inflammation in retinitis, the patient's current symptoms and physical examination findings suggest that the retinitis is caused by an opportunistic infection, which would not be effectively managed by increasing the dose of corticosteroids.

Choice D, "Vitreous tap/biopsy," is not the most appropriate choice at this time. While a vitreous tap/biopsy can be useful in diagnosing certain types of retinitis, such as viral retinit

**Answer**:B. Obtain magnetic resonance imaging of the brain.

The correct answer is B, Obtain magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, because the patient's symptoms of vision loss, paresthesias, and seizure history suggest a possible intracranial cause. The MRI will help to identify any structural abnormalities in the brain, such as a tumor or demyelinating lesion, that may be causing the patient's symptoms.

A, Initiate high-dose corticosteroid therapy, is not the correct answer because corticosteroids are not typically used to treat intracranial causes of vision loss and paresthesias. While corticosteroids may be used to treat certain eye conditions, such as uveitis, they are not indicated in this case based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings.

C, Perform a retinal biopsy, is not the correct answer because a retinal biopsy would not be necessary to diagnose a possible intracranial cause of the patient's symptoms. Retinal biopsies are typically performed to diagnose retinal diseases, such as retinal degeneration or tumors, and are not useful for diagnosing intracranial conditions.

D, Obtain computed tomography of the chest, is not the correct answer because a chest CT scan would not be helpful in diagnosing the patient's symptoms. While a chest CT scan may be useful in certain cases of seizures or neurological symptoms, it is not indicated in this case based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings.

Therefore, the best answer is B, Obtain magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, as it is the most appropriate test to diagnose the patient's symptoms and determine the underlying cause of his vision loss and paresthesias.

**Answer**:B. Ehrlichiosis

The patient's symptoms, such as fever, emesis, abdominal pain, and rash, are consistent with Ehrlichiosis, a tick-borne illness caused by the bacterium Ehrlichia chaffeensis. The patient's residence in the southeastern United States, where Ehrlichiosis is endemic, and the absence of any reported history of unusual exposures or insect or tick bites, suggest that Ehrlichiosis is a likely diagnosis.

Adenovirus (choice A) is a common cause of respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses, but it does not typically cause a rash or abdominal pain.

Epstein-Barr virus (choice C) is a common cause of infectious mononucleosis, but it does not typically cause a rash or abdominal pain.

Parvovirus B19 (choice D) is a common cause of fifth disease, which typically presents with a rash and fever, but it does not typically cause abdominal pain or emesis.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and geographic location, the most likely diagnosis is Ehrlichiosis, making choice B the correct answer.

**Answer**: B. Peripheral ossifying fibroma

The patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and imaging results are consistent with a peripheral ossifying fibroma (POF). POF is a rare benign tumor that arises from the periodontal membrane and is characterized by the proliferation of fibroblastic cells and the formation of bone and cartilage.

The patient's age and lack of significant medical history are consistent with POF, which typically affects adults in their 30s to 50s. The patient's symptoms of a progressively enlarging mandibular mass, difficulty tolerating a regular diet, and mobility of teeth 20 to 24 are also consistent with POF.

The physical examination findings of a 4.9-cm exophytic, nodular, slightly mobile mass of the left lower posterior alveolar ridge, involving the buccal and lingual gingiva, are consistent with POF. The absence of cervical lymphadenopathy is also consistent with POF, as it is a rare finding in this condition.

The imaging results, including the contrasted computed tomography (CT) scan, demonstrate an exophytic complex mass with areas of calcification and ossification inferiorly and a necrotic, cystic irregularly enhancing portion superiorly. These findings are consistent with POF, which can have a complex and variable appearance on imaging.

The additional biopsy performed (Figure, D) showed histopathologic features consistent with POF, including the presence of fibroblastic cells, bone and cartilage formation, and chronic inflammation.

In contrast, parosteal osteosarcoma (choice A) is a malignant tumor that arises from the bone and is characterized by the proliferation of malignant osteoblasts. It typically affects older adults and is associated with a worse prognosis than POF. The patient's age and lack of significant medical history are not consistent with parosteal osteosarcoma.

**Answer**: B. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of intermittent left-sided throat pain that progressed to left ear pain, along with the physical examination findings of an enhancing 1 × 6-mm lesion in the left side of the posterolateral tongue base and the histopathologic features of an intermediate-grade infiltrating neoplasm forming solid sheets and glandular structures, are consistent with a diagnosis of mucoepidermoid carcinoma.

Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a type of salivary gland cancer that arises in the epithelial cells of the salivary glands. It is the most common type of salivary gland cancer and typically affects the parotid gland, but it can also occur in other salivary glands, such as the tongue. The tumor cells are positive for CK7 and p63, which are markers of salivary gland differentiation, and negative for CK20, p16, and S-100, which are markers of squamous differentiation. The presence of glandular structures and positive staining for mucicarmine further support the diagnosis of mucoepidermoid carcinoma.

Squamous cell carcinoma (choice A) is a type of cancer that arises in the squamous cells of the epithelium and is commonly found in the head and neck region. However, the histopathologic features of squamous cell carcinoma are different from those of mucoepidermoid carcinoma, with a more irregular and pleomorphic appearance.

Acinic cell carcinoma (choice C) is a type of salivary gland cancer that arises in the acinar cells of the salivary glands. It is less common than mucoepidermoid carcinoma and typically affects the parotid gland. The histopathologic features of acinic cell carcinoma are also different from those of mucoepidermoid carcinoma, with a more acinar and papillary appearance.

**Answer**: D. Invasive necrotizing fungal gingivitis

The patient's symptoms and clinical findings, as well as the results of the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and biopsy, suggest invasive necrotizing fungal gingivitis (INFG) as the most likely diagnosis.

INFG is a severe and potentially life-threatening infection that can occur in immunocompromised patients, such as those with hematologic malignancies like acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). The patient's history of essential thrombocythemia and recent diagnosis of AML, as well as her pancytopenic state, suggest that she is immunocompromised and at risk for developing INFG.

The patient's symptoms of left-sided mandibular pain, decreased sensation at the left mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve, ecchymoses along the mandibular buccal-gingival borders bilaterally, and induration of the left floor of mouth and buccal mucosa are consistent with INFG. The rapid progression of necrotic lesions in the mandibular gingiva, extending past midline to involve mucosa on the right side, is also consistent with INFG.

The MRI findings of a 7 × 10 × 35-mm abscess involving both gingival and lingual aspects of the left anterior mandible, as well as the biopsy specimens of the right mandibular gingiva (shown in the Figure, C and D), support the diagnosis of INFG. The histopathologic images from the biopsy specimens show necrotic debris, fungal hyphae, and inflammation, which are characteristic features of INFG.

In contrast, viral infection (choice A) may cause gingivitis, but it is unlikely to cause the severe necrosis and abscess formation seen in this patient. Malignant neoplasm (choice B) can cause oral lesions, but the patient's history and clinical findings do not suggest a neoplastic process. Pemphigus vulgaris (

**Answer**: C. Ancient schwannoma

The correct answer is C. Ancient schwannoma because it best fits the clinical and imaging features described in the case.

A. Extraskeletal chondrosarcoma is an incorrect choice because it is a malignant tumor that arises from cartilage and typically affects the long bones, not the carotid space. It also tends to have a more aggressive clinical course and would likely have caused symptoms such as dysphagia, hoarseness, or dyspnea, which were not present in this case.

B. Malignant fibrous histiocytoma is also an incorrect choice because it is a malignant soft tissue tumor that typically affects the extremities, trunk, or retroperitoneum. It is rare in the head and neck region, and would likely have a more aggressive clinical course and histopathological features than what is described in the case.

D. Synovial sarcoma is an incorrect choice because it is a malignant tumor that arises from the synovial tissue of joints, tendons, or bursae. It is rare in the carotid space and would likely have a more aggressive clinical course and histopathological features than what is described in the case.

C. Ancient schwannoma, on the other hand, is a benign tumor that arises from the Schwann cells that surround the nerves. It is a rare tumor in the head and neck region, but it can occur in the carotid space. The clinical and imaging features described in the case, such as the painless, gradually increasing swelling in the neck, the well-defined, firm, nontender swelling extending from the angle of the mandible to the clavicle, and the presence of cystic areas and coarse specks of calcification within the mass, are consistent with an ancient schwannoma. Additionally, the fact that the mass displaced the right common carotid artery and internal jugular vein anterolaterally, and that there was no bone destruction, are also consistent with this diagnosis.

**Answer**: D. Leukemia relapse

The patient's history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) that transformed into acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and recent discontinuation of treatment with experimental drug CPX-351 due to renal failure, followed by successful induction of remission with mitoxantrone hydrochloride and etoposide therapy, suggests a high likelihood of leukemia relapse. The patient's symptoms of acute onset of blurred vision in his left eye without any pain, photophobia, diplopia, vision loss, or floaters, along with elevated intraocular pressure and presence of hypopyon in both eyes, are consistent with leukemia relapse in the eyes.

Hypopyon is a sign of intraocular inflammation and can be caused by various conditions, including endogenous endophthalmitis, HLA-B27 uveitis, and herpes simplex uveitis. However, in the context of this patient's history of MDS and AML, leukemia relapse is a more likely diagnosis.

Endogenous endophthalmitis, choice A, is an infection of the eye that can cause hypopyon, but it is unlikely in this case given the patient's history of MDS and AML.

HLA-B27 uveitis, choice B, is a type of uveitis that can cause hypopyon, but it is less likely in this case given the patient's age and history of MDS and AML.

Herpes simplex uveitis, choice C, is a viral infection that can cause hypopyon, but it is also less likely in this case given the patient's history of MDS and AML.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Leukemia relapse.

**Answer**:D. Choledochal cyst and long common biliopancreatic channel

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest gallstone pancreatitis, which is consistent with the diagnosis of choledochal cyst. The presence of a double lumen in the distal CBD and multiple gallstones within a dilated region of the cystic duct support this diagnosis. A choledochal cyst is a rare congenital abnormality that occurs when the pancreatic and bile ducts fail to properly separate during embryonic development. This results in a cystic dilatation of the common bile duct, which can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, jaundice, and pancreatitis.

 Choice A, choledochoduodenal fistula, is incorrect because it refers to an abnormal communication between the common bile duct and the duodenum, which is not present in this case.

 Choice B, biloma, is incorrect because it refers to a collection of bile outside the bile ducts, usually as a result of trauma or surgical complications. This is not the case in this patient.

 Choice C, gallbladder duplication with double cystic duct, is incorrect because it refers to a rare congenital anomaly where there are two gallbladders and two cystic ducts. In this case, there are multiple gallstones within a dilated region of the cystic duct, which suggests a choledochal cyst rather than a duplication of the gallbladder.

 Therefore, the correct answer is D, choledochal cyst and long common biliopancreatic channel.

**Answer**:B. Inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm

The patient's symptoms of a 1-month history of new-onset, persistent lower abdominal and flank pain, associated anorexia, and weight loss, along with the physical examination findings of minimal epigastric abdominal tenderness and no palpable masses, are consistent with an inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm. The laboratory findings of mild anemia and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate also support this diagnosis.

A mycotic aneurysm (choice A) is an aneurysm that is caused by an infection, typically bacterial or fungal. While the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings could be consistent with a mycotic aneurysm, the absence of fever and the lack of any signs of peritonitis or sepsis make this diagnosis less likely. Additionally, the patient's history of no previous abdominal surgery or procedures with intravascular instrumentation in the past year reduces the likelihood of a mycotic aneurysm.

A pseudoaneurysm (choice C) is a false aneurysm that occurs when there is a tear in the arterial wall, but the aneurysm sac is not in continuity with the true lumen. While a pseudoaneurysm could also present with abdominal pain, the patient's history and physical examination findings do not suggest this diagnosis.

Infrarenal aortitis due to diverticulitis (choice D) is inflammation of the aorta below the renal arteries, typically caused by a bacterial infection. While the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings could be consistent with this diagnosis, the absence of any signs of peritonitis or sepsis and the lack of a history of diverticulitis make this diagnosis less likely. Additionally, the patient's history of no previous abdominal surgery or procedures with intravascular instrumentation in the past year reduces the likelihood of infrarenal aortitis due to diverticulitis.

The correct answer is B: The elevated platelet count most likely resulted from a transient and not reproducible finding.

The patient's elevated platelet count could be due to various causes, including myeloproliferative disorders, stress, and myelodysplastic syndrome. However, based on the information provided, it is most likely that the elevated platelet count is a transient and not reproducible finding.

The patient's history of migraine headaches and the absence of any focal neurological symptoms suggest that the elevated platelet count may be related to the migraines. Migraines can cause transient changes in blood platelet counts, which can lead to an elevated platelet count in some cases. Additionally, the patient's normal funduscopic and neurologic examination results support the idea that the elevated platelet count is not due to a myeloproliferative disorder or myelodysplastic syndrome.

Therefore, option B is the correct answer.

Option A, "The elevated platelet count was most likely caused by a myeloproliferative disorder," is incorrect because there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has a myeloproliferative disorder. The patient's normal blood counts and lack of any other symptoms or signs of a myeloproliferative disorder make it unlikely that this is the cause of the elevated platelet count.

Option C, "The elevated platelet count was most likely caused by stress of migraine attacks," is also incorrect. While stress can affect platelet counts, it is unlikely that the patient's migraine attacks are causing the elevated platelet count in this case.

Option D, "The elevated platelet count was most likely caused by myelodysplastic syndrome," is incorrect because there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has myelodysplastic syndrome. The patient's normal blood counts and lack of any other symptoms or signs of myelodysplastic syndrome make it unlikely that this is the cause of the elevated platelet count.

Trichomycosis axillaris is a condition characterized by the formation of yellowish or whitish concretions around the hair shafts in the axillae. The patient's symptoms, such as the presence of creamy yellow concretions along several hair shafts in both armpits, strong axillary odor, and lack of itching, are consistent with this diagnosis. The microscopic examination of hair samples also supports this diagnosis, as it reveals the presence of fungal elements.

Artifactual peripilar hair casts (A) are unlikely, as the patient does not report using any hair products and the concretions do not disappear with cleansing with alcohol.

Pediculosis axillaris (C) is also unlikely, as the patient does not report any itching or discomfort in the axillae, and there is no mention of lice or nits in the patient's history.

White piedra (D) is a condition characterized by the formation of white, chalky concretions on the hair shaft, usually caused by a fungal infection. However, the patient's symptoms and the microscopic examination of hair samples do not support this diagnosis.

**Answer**: C. Eruptive syringoma

The correct answer is C. Eruptive syringoma because it matches the patient's symptoms and clinical presentation.

Eruptive syringoma is a rare benign skin condition characterized by multiple small, flesh-colored or brown papules that can appear suddenly or gradually, often on the trunk, neck, and extremities. The lesions are usually asymptomatic and may have a positive Darier sign, which is a diagnostic feature of the condition. The patient's history of a papular eruption on the trunk and legs of 3 months' duration, with minimal evolution and no vesiculation, is consistent with eruptive syringoma. The presence of numerous discrete smooth brown papules concentrated on the neck, chest, anterior and lateral thighs, and buttocks, as well as the positive Darier sign, further supports this diagnosis.

In contrast, the other answer choices do not match the patient's symptoms and clinical presentation:

A. Eruptive vellus hair cysts: This is a rare condition characterized by the sudden appearance of multiple small cysts on the scalp, face, or body. The cysts are usually filled with a cheesy, yellowish material and may have a small opening on the surface. The patient's lesions do not have these characteristics, and there is no mention of cysts or a cheesy material.

B. Urticaria pigmentosa: This is a common skin condition characterized by the sudden appearance of small, itchy, brown or gray patches on the skin. The patches may be surrounded by a red halo and may last for hours or days. The patient's lesions are not itchy, and there is no mention of a red halo or a history of urticaria.

D. Lichen nitidus: This is a rare skin condition characterized by the sudden appearance of small, shiny, flat-topped papules on the skin. The papules are usually skin-colored or slightly red and may be scattered over the body. The patient's lesions are not shiny or flat-topped, and there is no mention of a history of lichen nitidus.

**Answer**: C. Chrysiasis

Chrysiasis is a condition where there is a deposit of silver or silver-gray pigment in the skin, resulting in a characteristic blue-gray discoloration. In this case, the patient developed diffuse blue to slate-gray patches on her entire face immediately after administration of Q-switched Nd:YAG laser toning, which corresponded exactly to areas that had previously received laser treatment. The rapid onset and widespread distribution of the pigmentation, as well as the fact that it occurred in areas previously treated with laser, suggests that the pigmentation was caused by the laser treatment itself.

The patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis treated with oral gold salts 15 years ago increases the likelihood of chrysiasis, as gold salts have been associated with the development of chrysiasis. The rechallenge test administered on the right forearm, which resulted in a similar slate-gray macule, further supports this diagnosis.

Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (choice A) is a common complication of laser treatment, but it typically occurs weeks to months after treatment and is not as widespread as the pigmentation seen in this case. Argyria (choice B) is a condition where there is a deposit of silver in the skin, resulting in a blue-gray discoloration, but it is typically caused by exposure to silver or silver compounds, and is not associated with laser treatment. Tattoo pigmentation (choice D) is also not a likely diagnosis, as the pigmentation in this case was not localized to a specific area and did not have the characteristic pattern of a tattoo.

Therefore, based on the patient's history, clinical presentation, and rechallenge test results, the most likely diagnosis is chrysiasis.

**Answer**: C. Intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor therapy

The patient in the case presented with fluctuating vision in the right eye for several months, along with ptosis of the right upper eyelid and mild nuclear sclerotic cataracts in both eyes. On dilated fundus examination, the right eye showed infarcts in several nerve fiber layers along the arcades and nasal to the optic disc, as well as a few microaneurysms nasal to the optic disc. Fluorescein angiography revealed multiple areas of staining nasal to the nerve and inferotemporal to the nerve, as well as pinpoint leakage within the macula. Optical coherence tomography showed a central macular thickness of 454 μm and the presence of subretinal fluid in the subfoveal region.

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is macular edema due to recurrent meningioma of the right sphenoid wing. The patient's history of recurrent meningioma and radiation therapy increases the likelihood of this diagnosis. Macular edema is a common complication of meningioma, and it can cause vision loss if left untreated.

The correct answer, C. Intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor therapy, is the most appropriate treatment for macular edema due to meningioma. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy is effective in reducing macular edema and improving vision in patients with meningioma-related macular edema. Intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents, such as bevacizumab or ranibizumab, can help to reduce the amount of fluid in the retina and improve vision.

The other answer choices are not appropriate for this patient's condition. Observation (choice A) may be appropriate for patients with mild or stable vision loss, but it is not sufficient for patients with rapidly worsening vision, as in this case. Macular laser photocoagulation (choice B) is not effective in treating macular edema due

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is B: Prescribe oral cimetidine.

Cimetidine is an H2-blocker, which is a type of medication that reduces the production of histamine in the body. Histamine is a chemical that is released in response to allergens, and it causes many of the symptoms associated with allergies, such as itching, redness, and swelling. By blocking the production of histamine, cimetidine can help to reduce the symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis, which is the likely cause of the patient's conjunctival inflammation and itching.

The other answer choices are not as appropriate for several reasons:

A: Prescribe oral acyclovir. Acyclovir is an antiviral medication that is used to treat herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections. However, the patient's conjunctival cultures were negative for HSV, and there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has an HSV infection. Therefore, prescribing acyclovir would not be appropriate.

C: Prescribe topical corticosteroids and/or cyclosporine. Topical corticosteroids and cyclosporine are both immunosuppressive medications that can help to reduce inflammation. However, they are not likely to be effective in treating allergic conjunctivitis, which is caused by an allergic reaction rather than an immune system dysfunction.

D: Refer the patient to an allergist. While it is possible that the patient's symptoms are related to an allergic reaction, it is not necessary to refer the patient to an allergist at this time. The patient's symptoms can be managed with medication, and it is more appropriate to start treatment with cimetidine before considering a referral to an allergist.

In summary, the best answer is B: Prescribe oral cimetidine, as it is the most appropriate medication for treating allergic conjunctivitis and reducing the patient's symptoms.

**Answer**: D. Obtain a whole-body fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)/CT scan and paraneoplastic antibody evaluation

**Explanation**:

The patient's symptoms of diplopia, ataxia, and unintentional weight loss, along with the physical examination findings of right eye heterotropia, left ptosis, flattening of the right nasolabial fold, and bilateral restricted upgaze, suggest a possible diagnosis of a paraneoplastic syndrome. A paraneoplastic syndrome is a group of symptoms that occur in association with a cancer, but are not directly caused by the cancer itself. Instead, they are caused by the immune system's response to the cancer.

The patient's history of heavy smoking and the presence of pleural thickening and mediastinal lymphadenopathy on chest radiography suggest a possible diagnosis of lung cancer. The patient's symptoms and examination findings, along with the radiographic findings, support the need for further evaluation to rule out a paraneoplastic syndrome.

Option D, obtaining a whole-body fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)/CT scan and paraneoplastic antibody evaluation, is the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation. The FDG-PET/CT scan can help identify any potential malignancy, including lung cancer, and the paraneoplastic antibody evaluation can help support the diagnosis of a paraneoplastic syndrome.

Option A, obtaining evoked potentials, may be useful in evaluating the patient's diplopia and ataxia, but it would not provide information about the underlying cause of the symptoms.

Option B, obtaining electromyography (EMG), may be useful in evaluating the patient's ataxia, but it would not provide information about the underlying cause of the symptoms.

Option C, checking thiamine levels and starting oral supplementation, may be useful in treating a thiamine deficiency, but it would not provide information about the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

**Answer**: B. Ulcerated segmental infantile hemangioma (IH)

Let's go through each of the answer choices and explain why they are incorrect or correct:

A. Acrodermatitis enteropathica: This is a rare genetic disorder that affects the skin and gastrointestinal system. It is characterized by chronic diarrhea, malabsorption, and skin rashes. While the skin rashes can resemble the ulcers in the case described, the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms and the presence of telangiectasias extending from the anus to the ulcers make this diagnosis less likely.

B. Ulcerated segmental infantile hemangioma (IH): This is a rare vascular tumor that occurs in infants. It typically presents as a rapidly growing, painful, and bleeding mass. The ulceration and fibrinous material on the surface of the ulcers, as well as the presence of telangiectasias, are consistent with IH. The location of the ulcers, superior to the anal verge, is also consistent with this diagnosis.

C. Candidal dermatitis: This is a common infection caused by Candida, a fungus that can infect the skin. It typically presents as a red, itchy rash with scalloped borders. While candidal dermatitis can occur in the diaper area, the presence of ulcers and fibrinous material on the surface makes this diagnosis less likely.

D. Jacquet erosive diaper dermatitis: This is a severe form of diaper rash that is caused by a combination of factors, including prolonged exposure to urine and stool, allergies, and infections. It typically presents as erythematous, scaly, and crusted plaques. While the location of the ulcers in this case is consistent with Jacquet erosive diaper dermatitis, the presence of fibrinous material and telangiectasias makes this diagnosis less likely.

Therefore, based on the symptoms and physical examination findings described, the most likely diagnosis is B. Ulcerated segmental infantile hemang

**Answer**: D. Metastatic breast carcinoma

The patient's medical history of localized invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast treated 13 years ago, combined with the presence of a lesion in the right parotid gland, suggests a metastatic origin. The imaging findings of a spiculated border and ill-defined surrounding enhancement extending close to the stylomastoid foramen, along with the low T2 signal and lack of perineural spread, are consistent with a metastatic lesion. The cytologic and histologic findings of atypical epithelial cells with hyperchromatic vesicular nuclei and moderate amounts of eosinophilic cytoplasm, as well as the positive immunohistochemical staining for cytokeratin 7 (CK7), estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and androgen receptor (AR), support a diagnosis of metastatic breast carcinoma.

Adenoid cystic carcinoma (Choice A) is a malignant salivary gland tumor that typically affects the parotid gland. However, the imaging findings and histologic features described in the case do not support this diagnosis.

Salivary duct carcinoma (Choice B) is a malignant tumor that arises in the major salivary glands, including the parotid gland. However, the presence of a spiculated border and ill-defined surrounding enhancement, as well as the positive immunohistochemical staining for ER, PR, and AR, are not typical features of salivary duct carcinoma.

Carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma (Choice C) is a rare type of salivary gland cancer that arises from a pre-existing pleomorphic adenoma. While this diagnosis cannot be entirely excluded based on the information provided, the absence of a history of a previous pleomorphic adenoma and the presence of a spiculated border and ill-defined surrounding enhancement suggest that metastatic breast carcinoma is a more likely diagnosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Metastatic breast carcinoma.

**Answer**: C. Juvenile xanthogranuloma

The correct answer is C. Juvenile xanthogranuloma because it matches the clinical and pathological features described in the case.

Juvenile xanthogranuloma (JXG) is a rare benign tumor that typically affects children and young adults. It is characterized by a slow-growing, painless mass in the skin or subcutaneous tissue, often with a yellowish or orange discoloration. The lesion is usually small, but it can enlarge over time, as described in the case.

The pathological features of JXG are consistent with the case description. JXG is composed of lipidized histiocytic cells with eosinophils in a background of collagen, as seen in the histopathologic images provided (Figure, B-D). The lobules of lipidized histiocytic cells with eosinophils are characteristic of JXG. The lesion stains negatively for S-100 and CD1a, which is also consistent with JXG.

The other answer choices do not match the clinical and pathological features of the case.

A. Spitz nevus is a benign melanocytic tumor that typically appears as a pigmented macule or nodule on the skin. It is usually small and does not have the same yellowish or orange discoloration as JXG. Spitz nevi are also more common in older children and adults than in infants.

B. Pyogenic granuloma is a benign vascular tumor that usually presents as a rapidly growing, painful mass on the skin or mucous membranes. It is often associated with trauma or infection and has a distinctive histopathological appearance, with numerous capillaries and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate.

**Answer**: C. Ameloblastic carcinoma

The correct answer is C. Ameloblastic carcinoma because it matches the given symptoms and characteristics of the patient's condition.

Ameloblastic carcinoma is a rare type of cancer that affects the mandible and is characterized by a slow-growing, painless mass that can cause numbness and difficulty swallowing, which are symptoms reported by the patient. The patient's history of edentulism and the absence of remarkable weight loss also align with the typical presentation of this condition.

The CT images provided in the question show a multilocular, low-attenuation lesion with severe erosion of the facial and lingual cortices, which is consistent with the radiographic features of ameloblastic carcinoma. The presence of wispy, ill-defined intralesional septa and a cystic and solid nature of the mass, as seen on soft-tissue CT images, further support this diagnosis.

In contrast, the other answer choices do not match the patient's symptoms and radiographic findings as well.

A. Ameloblastoma is a benign tumor that does not have the same radiographic features as ameloblastic carcinoma. It typically presents as a well-defined, unilocular or multilocular radiolucency with a smooth border and does not have the same degree of cortical erosion or scalloping.

B. Central mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a malignant tumor that arises in the salivary glands, but it typically presents with a different clinical and radiographic picture. It often causes pain, swelling, and difficulty swallowing, and the radiographic features include a well-defined, expansile mass with irregular margins and areas of calcification or osteolysis.

D. Odontogenic myxoma is a rare benign tumor that arises from the odontogenic tissue, but it typically presents as a well-defined, unilocular or multilocular radiolucency with a smooth border and does not have the same degree of cortical erosion or scalloping.

A. Lipoma is a benign tumor made up of fat cells, and it is not related to the symptoms or test results described in the case.

B. Sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect various organs, including the larynx. However, the description of the lesion as a yellowish floppy granular proliferation and the positive staining for thioflavin T and Congo red are not consistent with sarcoidosis.

D. Gouty tophi are deposits of uric acid crystals that form in the joints and soft tissues, typically as a result of hyperuricemia. This diagnosis is also not related to the symptoms or test results described in the case.

The patient's symptoms of persistent globus pharyngis (a feeling of a lump in the throat) and the endoscopic examination findings of yellowish lesions affecting the arytenoids and posterior aspects of the aryepiglottic folds are consistent with localized laryngeal amyloidosis. The positive staining for thioflavin T and Congo red, which are specific stains for amyloid deposits, support this diagnosis. Additionally, the absence of any other symptoms or evidence of systemic involvement suggests that the amyloidosis is localized to the larynx.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Localized laryngeal amyloidosis.

The correct answer is C: Dermoid cyst.

A: Ranula

A ranula is a type of benign tumor that arises from the remnants of the thyroglossal duct. It is typically located in the neck, just above the thyroid gland. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as the presence of a submental mass and softening of the floor of mouth, are consistent with a ranula. However, the imaging findings do not support this diagnosis. The lesion demonstrated a fluid signal with T2 hyperintensity, T1 hypointensity, and peripheral rim enhancement, which is not consistent with the typical imaging features of a ranula. Additionally, the patient's history of papillary thyroid cancer and total thyroidectomy makes it less likely that this is a ranula.

B: Lymphangioma

Lymphangioma is a benign tumor that arises from the lymphatic vessels. It can occur in various parts of the body, including the neck. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are not consistent with lymphangioma. The lesion's imaging features, such as the fluid signal with T2 hyperintensity and peripheral rim enhancement, are also not typical of lymphangioma.

D: Suprahyoid thyroglossal duct cyst

A suprahyoid thyroglossal duct cyst is a type of cyst that arises from the remnants of the thyroglossal duct. It is typically located in the neck, above the hyoid bone. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are not consistent with a suprahyoid thyroglossal duct cyst. The imaging features of the lesion, such as the fluid signal with T2 hyperintensity and peripheral rim enhancement, are also not typical of a suprahyoid thyroglossal duct cyst.

**Answer**: B. Shingles

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with shingles, a viral infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus. The patient's history of a childhood history of plantar warts and the appearance of the lesions on his foot, which are described as grouped, brown, flat-topped papules, are consistent with shingles. The patient's complaint of a pruritic rash on his left thigh, which started several days before the appearance of the plantar foot lesions, is also consistent with shingles, as it is not uncommon for patients with shingles to experience itching or burning sensations in the affected area before the onset of the rash.

The patient's recent chemotherapy treatment and pancytopenia may also be relevant to the patient's overall health and potential treatment plan, but they are not directly related to the patient's diagnosis of shingles.

**Answer**: A. Plantar warts

While the patient does have a history of plantar warts, the current lesions on his foot do not seem to be consistent with plantar warts. Plantar warts are typically small, rough, and gray or brown in color, and they are usually not painful. The patient's lesions, on the other hand, are described as grouped, brown, flat-topped papules, which are not consistent with the typical appearance of plantar warts.

**Answer**: C. Cutaneous lymphoma

Cutaneous lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the skin. While the patient's history of transformed marginal zone lymphoma and the appearance of the lesions on his foot may be concerning for cutaneous lymphoma, the patient's recent chemotherapy treatment and pancytopenia make it less likely that the lesions are related to cutaneous lymphoma.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain why D. Ectopic pancreas is the correct answer and why the other choices are incorrect.

**Answer**: D. Ectopic pancreas

The correct answer is D. Ectopic pancreas because the patient's symptoms and test results are consistent with this diagnosis. Ectopic pancreas is a rare condition in which pancreatic tissue is present outside of the normal pancreatic location. In this case, the patient's postprandial epigastric abdominal pain, unintentional weight loss, and focal gastric thickening on computed tomography suggest the presence of an ectopic pancreas in the gastric antrum. The endoscopic ultrasonography and magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography results also support this diagnosis, showing a hypervascular and exophytic mass in the gastric antrum and locoregional lymphadenopathy.

Now, let's discuss why the other choices are incorrect:

A. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST): GIST is a rare tumor that can occur in the digestive tract, but it typically presents with different symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and rectal bleeding. The patient's symptoms and test results do not suggest a GIST.

B. Gastric cancer: Gastric cancer can cause abdominal pain, weight loss, and other symptoms, but it typically presents with more advanced symptoms such as vomiting, hiccups, and abdominal distension. The patient's symptoms and test results do not suggest gastric cancer.

C. Peptic ulcer disease: Peptic ulcer disease can cause abdominal pain, especially after meals, but it typically presents with different symptoms such as heartburn, regurgitation, and nausea. The patient's symptoms and test results do not suggest peptic ulcer disease.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and test results, the most likely diagnosis is D. Ectopic pancreas.

**Answer**: C. Cavernous hemangioma

The correct answer is C. Cavernous hemangioma because it is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and the imaging findings.

A. Schwannoma is an incorrect choice because it is a benign tumor that originates from the supporting cells of the peripheral nervous system, and it does not typically present with a cystic mass or enlarged venous structure.

B. Pseudoaneurysm is also an incorrect choice because it is a dilated blood vessel that can occur as a result of trauma or infection, and it does not typically present with a round, partially enhancing, cystic mass.

D. Paraganglioma is an incorrect choice because it is a rare tumor that originates from the paraganglia, and it does not typically present with a cystic mass or enlarged venous structure.

In contrast, Cavernous hemangioma is a benign vascular tumor that is composed of enlarged, blood-filled channels and is often associated with an enlarged venous structure. The imaging findings of a round, partially enhancing, cystic mass near the tail of the parotid gland, as well as the presence of an enlarged and distended venous structure, are consistent with a cavernous hemangioma.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is C. Cavernous hemangioma.

**Answer**: D. The positive ANA test result is nonspecific and may be related to autoimmune thyroid disease

The correct answer is D because the patient's positive ANA test result could be related to autoimmune thyroid disease, rather than systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or rheumatoid arthritis. The patient's symptoms of fatigue and polyarthralgias are non-specific and do not necessarily point to a specific diagnosis. The absence of other symptoms such as joint swelling, morning stiffness, fever, and skin rashes also makes SLE less likely. Additionally, the patient's normal thyroid function test results and lack of thyroid symptoms suggest that autoimmune thyroid disease is a more likely explanation for the positive ANA test result.

 choice A is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis. Although joint pain and fatigue are common symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, the patient's lack of joint swelling and morning stiffness makes it less likely.

 choice B is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not meet the criteria for a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE is a systemic autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organs, including the skin, joints, kidneys, and nervous system. The patient's lack of skin rashes, joint swelling, and other symptoms, as well as her normal complement levels and negative anti-double-stranded DNA test result, make SLE less likely.

 choice C is incorrect because it is not possible to predict the future development of SLE based on a single positive ANA test result. While a positive ANA test result is a common finding in SLE, it is also found in other autoimmune diseases, such as autoimmune thyroid disease. Additionally, the patient's lack of other symptoms and laboratory abnormalities makes it less likely that she will develop SLE in the future.

**Answer**:B. Perform a bone marrow biopsy

The patient's symptoms of fatigue, elevated white blood cell count, and splenomegaly suggest a possible diagnosis of leukemia. A bone marrow biopsy is the next step in the diagnostic workup to confirm this suspicion. It will allow for a detailed examination of the bone marrow cells, including the percentage of immature granulocytes, which is already elevated in the peripheral blood. Additionally, a bone marrow biopsy can help identify any abnormalities in the bone marrow architecture and assess for any infiltration by malignant cells.

A. Order a heterophile antibody test:
While a heterophile antibody test can be useful in the diagnosis of certain types of leukemia, such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia, it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a myeloid malignancy, and a heterophile antibody test is not specific enough to differentiate between myeloid and lymphoid leukemias.

C. Start cytarabine and daunorubicin chemotherapy:
While cytarabine and daunorubicin are commonly used chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), starting chemotherapy without a definitive diagnosis would be premature. A bone marrow biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine the specific subtype of AML before initiating treatment.

D. Order leukapheresis:
Leukapheresis is a procedure that removes excess white blood cells from the blood, which can be useful in the management of leukocytosis. However, it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as the patient's elevated white blood cell count is not the primary concern. The focus should be on diagnosing and treating the underlying malignancy, rather than managing its symptoms.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Perform a bone marrow biopsy.

**Answer**: B. Iododerma

Iododerma is a rare cutaneous adverse effect of iodine excess, typically seen in patients with thyroid disease who have been exposed to high levels of iodine. The patient's history of chronic kidney disease and use of amiodarone, a drug that contains iodine, suggests that he may have excessive iodine levels in his body. The skin lesions described in the case, including the scaly erythematous papules on the forearms, are consistent with the characteristic skin manifestations of iododerma.

The patient's laboratory results also support this diagnosis. An elevated serum iodine level of 42,305 ng/mL (normal range, 40-92 ng/mL) suggests that the patient has excessive iodine levels in his body. Additionally, the patient's serum creatinine level of 3.79 mg/dL (normal range, 0.70-1.40 mg/dL) indicates that he has chronic kidney disease, which can lead to impaired iodine excretion and contribute to the development of iododerma.

The other answer choices do not fit the patient's clinical presentation or laboratory results. Sweet syndrome (choice A) is a condition characterized by the rapid onset of fever, neutrophilia, and painful skin lesions. While the patient's skin lesions are erythematous and scaly, they do not have the characteristic painful or tender nature of Sweet syndrome.

Sporotrichosis (choice C) is a fungal infection that typically presents with skin lesions and nodules, often with a characteristic "boxcar" shape. The patient's skin lesions do not have this characteristic shape, and there is no evidence to suggest a fungal infection.

Pemphigus vegetans (choice D) is an autoimmune disease that affects the skin and mucous membranes, causing blisters and sores. While the patient's skin lesions are blistering and scaly, they do not have the characteristic distribution or duration of pemphigus vegetans.

**Answer**:A. Nocardia brasiliensis skin infection

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, as well as the results of the skin biopsy and culture, suggest a diagnosis of Nocardia brasiliensis skin infection.

Nocardia brasiliensis is a gram-positive, aerobic actinomycete that can cause cutaneous infections, typically in individuals with compromised immune systems. The patient's recent hospitalization for congestive heart failure and bacterial pneumonia, as well as her age, suggest that she may have a weakened immune system, making her more susceptible to opportunistic infections such as this.

The patient's symptoms, including the painful ulceration on the right distal forearm and the tender, red nodules in the right antecubital fossa, are consistent with a cutaneous infection. The fact that the patient had been discharged approximately 2 weeks prior to the current admission, and that the symptoms developed shortly after that discharge, suggest that the infection may have been incubating for some time.

The skin biopsy and culture results support the diagnosis of Nocardia brasiliensis skin infection. The dense neutrophilic infiltrate and associated tissue necrosis (Figure, B) are consistent with an inflammatory response to the infection, while the presence of organisms on Gram stain (Figure, C) confirms the presence of bacteria. The fact that the patient had recently cleaned her fish tank, played with her pet cat, and gardened in her indoor cactus garden, suggests that she may have been exposed to the bacteria through a contaminated environment or animal contact.

Staphylococcus aureus skin infection (choice B) is less likely, as the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest a typical staphylococcal infection. Mycobacterium marinum skin infection (choice C) is also less likely, as the patient does not have a history of exposure to aquatic environments, and the skin lesions do not have the characteristic appearance of mycobacterial infections.

In this case, the patient presented with multiple red-brown to purplish follicular papules and nodules in the bilateral axillae, which is consistent with acne agminata.

The other answer choices do not match the symptoms described in the question:

A. Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease that can cause skin lesions, but it is not characterized by follicular papules and nodules.

C. Miliary tuberculosis is a form of tuberculosis that affects the skin, but it typically causes small, millet-like lesions, not follicular papules and nodules.

The correct answer is C. Excise the lesion.

The lesion in question is a papule on the right lower eyelid of an 11-month-old boy. It has been growing in size over the past 3 months and has recently developed an area of ulceration. The patient has also started rubbing his eyelid intermittently, causing irritation and minimal bleeding.

Given these symptoms, it is likely that the lesion is causing discomfort and irritation for the patient. Moreover, the lesion's growth and ulceration suggest that it may be a malignant tumor, such as a basal cell carcinoma or a squamous cell carcinoma.

Therefore, the best course of action would be to excise the lesion surgically, in order to remove it completely and alleviate the patient's discomfort. This would also allow for a histopathological examination of the excised tissue, which could confirm the diagnosis of a malignant tumor and guide further treatment if necessary.

In contrast, option A, "Continue observation," would not be an appropriate course of action at this time, as the lesion has already been growing in size and showing signs of ulceration. Continuing to observe the lesion without intervening could allow it to continue growing and potentially causing further discomfort and complications for the patient.

Option B, "Prescribe propranolol hydrochloride," is also not an appropriate course of action, as propranolol is a medication used to treat conditions such as hypertension, angina, and certain heart rhythm disorders. It is not typically used to treat eyelid lesions, and would not be effective in removing the lesion or alleviating the patient's discomfort.

Option D, "Perform curettage of the lesion," is also not an appropriate course of action, as curettage is a procedure that involves scraping the lesion with a curette, which may not be effective in removing the entire lesion, especially if it has grown to a significant size. Additionally, curettage may not provide a definitive diagnosis of the lesion, as it would

**Answer**:C. Perform fluorescein angiography

The patient's symptoms of acute-onset bilateral decreased vision and metamorphopsia, along with the physical examination findings of fine inferior keratic precipitates, anterior chamber cells, and numerous confluent creamy yellow lesions in the peripheral retina, are consistent with a diagnosis of uveitis. Uveitis is a general term that refers to inflammation in the uveal tract, which includes the iris, ciliary body, and choroid.

Fluorescein angiography is a diagnostic test that uses a fluorescent dye to visualize the blood vessels in the retina and choroid. It is commonly used to evaluate patients with uveitis, as it can help to identify the location and extent of inflammation, as well as any potential complications such as retinal vasculitis or choroidal neovascularization. In this case, fluorescein angiography would be the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation, as it can help to confirm the diagnosis of uveitis and guide further management.

In contrast, B-scan ultrasonography is a diagnostic test that uses high-frequency sound waves to evaluate the eye and surrounding tissues. It is commonly used to evaluate patients with ocular trauma, retinal detachment, or vitreous hemorrhage. While B-scan ultrasonography may be useful in some cases of uveitis, it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's evaluation, as it is unlikely to provide additional information about the underlying inflammation.

Electroretinography (ERG) is a diagnostic test that measures the electrical activity of the retina. It is commonly used to evaluate patients with retinal disorders such as retinitis pigmentosa or cone-rod dystrophy. While ERG may be useful in some cases of uveitis, it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's evaluation, as it is unlikely to provide additional information about the underlying inflammation.

Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is a diagnostic test that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to visualize the blood vessels in the body. It is commonly used to

**Answer**: C. Plexiform neurofibroma

The correct answer is C. Plexiform neurofibroma because it matches the patient's symptoms and test results. A plexiform neurofibroma is a benign tumor that grows on nerves, and in this case, it affects the left parotid gland and surrounding tissues. The patient's symptoms of a left-sided facial mass, recurrent otitis media, and macrocephaly are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's history of macrocephaly, or an abnormally large head, is also a common feature of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a genetic disorder that can cause plexiform neurofibromas.

The patient's magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) results also support this diagnosis. The infiltrative vascular mass of the left parotid, skull base, and deeper facial structures, with occlusion of the left internal jugular vein and extension into the external auditory canal, is consistent with a plexiform neurofibroma.

Now, let's discuss why the other answer choices are incorrect:

A. Acute parotitis or parotid abscess: While the patient does have a mass in the left parotid gland, the symptoms and test results do not suggest an acute infection. The patient's symptoms have been present for several months, and the MRI and MRA results do not show signs of an abscess or inflammation.

B. Venous malformation: A venous malformation is a congenital abnormality of the veins that can cause a mass or swelling. However, the patient's symptoms and test results do not suggest a venous malformation. The MRI and MRA results show an infiltrative vascular mass, which is not consistent with a venous malformation.

D. Infantile hemangioma: An infantile hemangioma is a benign tumor of the blood vessels that is usually present at birth or appears within the first few months of life. While

**Answer**: A. Lymphoepithelial carcinoma of parotid gland

The correct answer is A, Lymphoepithelial carcinoma of parotid gland, for the following reasons:

A. Lymphoepithelial carcinoma of parotid gland:
This choice is correct because the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and imaging results are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's slow-growing, non-tender mass in the left parotid region, accompanied by occasional blepharospasm and paresthesia in the ipsilateral eye and cheek, are typical symptoms of lymphoepithelial carcinoma. The T2-weighted MRI showing a poorly marginated mass abutting the left superficial parotid with involvement of the masseter, and the intraoperative frozen section demonstrating a cellular infiltrate, further support this diagnosis. Additionally, the permanent histologic sections showing nests of nonkeratinizing undifferentiated atypical epithelial cells intimately intermingled with a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, and the positive immunohistochemical analysis for cytokeratin AE1/3 in the carcinoma cells, are consistent with lymphoepithelial carcinoma.

B. Undifferentiated carcinoma of parotid gland:
This choice is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and imaging results do not support this diagnosis. Undifferentiated carcinoma of the parotid gland is a rare entity that typically presents with a rapidly growing mass in the parotid gland, often with pain, swelling, and facial weakness or paralysis. The patient's slow-growing, non-tender mass and absence of facial weakness or paralysis do not fit this pattern.

C. Lymphoma:
This choice is incorrect because, although lymphoma can present with a mass in the parotid gland, the patient's symptoms and imaging results do not support this diagnosis. Lymphoma typically presents with a rapidly growing mass,

**Answer**: D. Calcinosis cutis

The correct answer is D. Calcinosis cutis because it matches the characteristics described in the question. Calcinosis cutis is a condition where calcium deposits form in the skin, which can cause firm, non-tender, and non-erythematous masses. The fact that the mass in the case was superficially located in the dermis and filled with soft white material that appeared as purple to blue crystals, and the presence of granulomatous reaction at the periphery, are both consistent with Calcinosis cutis.

Schwannoma (A) is an incorrect choice because it is a benign tumor that originates from the supporting cells of the nervous system, and is not associated with calcium deposits.

Hamartoma (B) is also an incorrect choice because it is a benign growth that consists of a mixture of mature cells and tissues, and does not have the characteristic calcium deposits of Calcinosis cutis.

Epidermoid cyst (C) is an incorrect choice because it is a type of cyst that forms in the skin, usually as a result of a blocked oil gland, and does not have the same characteristics as Calcinosis cutis.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Calcinosis cutis.

**Answer**:C. Sialolipoma

The correct answer is C. Sialolipoma, as it is a benign tumor that arises from the salivary gland tissue, specifically from the parotid gland in this case. The patient's symptoms, such as a slowly growing mass in the preauricular region, and the imaging findings, including the fat signal intensity on T1-weighted and T2-weighted sequences, and the heterogeneous soft-tissue enhancement on T1 post-contrast, are consistent with a diagnosis of sialolipoma.

A. Parotitis, or inflammation of the parotid gland, is an incorrect diagnosis as the patient does not have symptoms or signs of inflammation, such as swelling, redness, or pain in the parotid region. Additionally, the imaging findings do not suggest inflammation.

B. Lipoma, a benign tumor composed of fat cells, is also an incorrect diagnosis. While the mass in this case has a fat signal intensity on imaging, it is not a typical lipoma as it is located within the parotid gland and has a well-defined capsule.

D. Hemangioma, a benign tumor of blood vessels, is also not a correct diagnosis. While it can present as a mass in the head and neck region, it typically has a different imaging appearance, with a characteristic "spider-like" or "snowflake-like" pattern on T2-weighted sequences.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is C. Sialolipoma.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain why C. Eagle syndrome is the correct answer and why the other choices are incorrect.

**Answer**: C. Eagle syndrome

Eagle syndrome, also known as styloid syndrome, is a rare condition that occurs when the styloid process, a bony structure in the temporal bone, becomes elongated or deviated, causing pain and discomfort in the neck, face, and throat. The symptoms of Eagle syndrome can include otalgia (ear pain), facial pain, swelling, and dysphagia (difficulty swallowing), which are all present in the case described in the question.

The patient's history of a 20 pack-year smoking history and a previous blunt trauma to the left maxilla region approximately 10 years prior to presentation also support the diagnosis of Eagle syndrome. The ossified mass seen on the computed tomography (CT) scan of the neck is consistent with an elongated styloid process, which is a common finding in Eagle syndrome.

Now, let's discuss why the other answer choices are incorrect:

A. Hyoid bursitis: Hyoid bursitis is inflammation of the bursa that surrounds the hyoid bone in the neck. While it can cause neck pain and swelling, it is not typically associated with facial pain, dysphagia, or a mass in the parapharyngeal space.

B. Temporomandibular joint dysfunction: Temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dysfunction can cause pain in the jaw, face, and neck, but it is not typically associated with swelling or difficulty swallowing. The patient's history of a 20 pack-year smoking history and the presence of a mass in the parapharyngeal space also argue against TMJ dysfunction.

D. Metastatic thyroid cancer: While thyroid cancer can cause neck pain and swelling, it is not typically associated with facial pain or dysphagia. The patient's history of a 20 pack-year smoking history and the presence of a mass in the parapharyngeal space do not support a diagnosis of thyroid

**Answer**: B. Pulmonary artery sarcoma

The patient's symptoms of progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion, along with the physical examination findings of flattening of the interventricular septum and multiple pulmonary nodules, suggest a cardiovascular condition affecting the lungs. The patient's history of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism also support this diagnosis.

The patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, which revealed a large filling defect within the main pulmonary artery, consistent with a pulmonary artery sarcoma. This diagnosis is supported by the patient's history of smoking and the presence of multiple pulmonary nodules.

Option A, venous thromboembolic disease, is an unlikely diagnosis given the patient's history of pulmonary embolism and the absence of any recent episode of deep venous thrombosis.

Option C, locally advanced lung cancer, is also an unlikely diagnosis given the patient's lack of symptoms such as cough, chest pain, or hemoptysis, and the absence of any suspicious lung lesions on the CT scan.

Option D, pulmonary tumor embolism, is a rare condition that occurs when a tumor embolus lodges in the pulmonary artery. While this diagnosis cannot be entirely excluded based on the information provided, it is less likely than pulmonary artery sarcoma given the patient's history and CT scan findings.

Therefore, the correct answer is B, Pulmonary artery sarcoma.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is D: The patient is likely to have unfavorable cytogenetic features, positive ZAP-70 expression/promoter unmethylated status, and clonal evolution.

Here's why:

A: The patient is much less likely to respond and have a durable remission with chemoimmunotherapy.

This statement is incorrect because the patient has already had a response to chemoimmunotherapy in the past, with a clinical complete remission achieved after 4 cycles of FR therapy. While the patient's relapse after 2.5 years suggests that the response may not have been durable, it does not necessarily mean that they will not respond to chemoimmunotherapy in the future.

B: The patient is at lower risk of Richter transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

This statement is incorrect because the patient's IgHV-mutated status is not associated with a lower risk of Richter transformation. In fact, studies have shown that patients with CLL who have an unmutated IgHV gene have a higher risk of Richter transformation.

C: IgHV-mutated status is defined by more than a 2% sequence difference compared with the germline sequence and can change over the evolution of the disease.

This statement is correct, but it does not directly relate to the patient's prognosis or treatment response. The patient's IgHV-mutated status is unmutated, which suggests that their disease may have a more aggressive course.

D: The patient is likely to have unfavorable cytogenetic features, positive ZAP-70 expression/promoter unmethylated status, and clonal evolution.

This statement is correct because the patient's cytogenetic features, including del(17)(p13.1) and del(13)(q14), are considered unfavorable. Additionally, the patient's IgHV-unmutated status and positive ZAP-70 expression/promoter unmethylated status suggest that their disease may have a more aggressive course and be less responsive to chemoimmunotherapy.

**Answer**:C. Intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm

The patient's symptoms of diarrhea and weight loss, along with the presence of an ampullary mass, suggest a possible pancreatic or biliary tract disorder. The laboratory results, specifically the elevated carcinoembryonic antigen level, support this suspicion.

The computed tomographic scan findings are consistent with an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of the pancreas. IPMNs are tumors that arise in the pancreatic duct and can cause obstruction of the duct, leading to symptoms such as diarrhea and weight loss. The heterogeneous soft-tissue nodule seen in the scan (arrowhead) is consistent with an IPMN.

Mucinous cystic neoplasm (choice A) is a benign tumor that arises from the mucous membrane of the pancreas. Although it can cause symptoms similar to IPMN, it is typically slower growing and less aggressive.

Primary duodenal carcinoid tumor (choice B) is a rare tumor that arises in the small intestine. Although it can cause diarrhea and weight loss, it typically does not cause an elevated carcinoembryonic antigen level.

Serous cystadenoma (choice D) is a benign tumor that arises from the pancreatic duct. It is typically smaller than IPMN and does not cause obstruction of the duct.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, as well as the computed tomographic scan findings, the most likely diagnosis is an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) of the pancreas.

**Answer**: C. Innominate artery pseudoaneurysm

The patient's symptoms of left arm and leg hemiparesis, coolness of the right upper arm, cyanotic right fingers, and absence of the right-sided radial and brachial pulses suggest a vascular problem affecting the right arm. The pulsatile mass in the upper chest wall on the right side is consistent with a pseudoaneurysm.

A pseudoaneurysm is a dilatation of the arterial wall that occurs due to a weakening of the vessel wall, often as a result of trauma or surgery. In this case, the patient's history of radiation therapy and surgery in the neck, including a pectoralis major flap, may have contributed to the development of the pseudoaneurysm.

The innominate artery is a branch of the aortic arch that supplies blood to the right arm and head. A pseudoaneurysm of the innominate artery would explain the patient's symptoms of arm ischemia and posterior stroke.

The magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the head (Figure 1A) shows an acute right-hemispheric stroke with left-sided hemiparesis, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms. The selective angiogram of the innominate artery (Figure 1B) shows a pseudoaneurysm of the innominate artery, which is the likely cause of the patient's symptoms.

Carotid stump syndrome (choice A) is a rare condition that occurs when there is a severe stenosis or occlusion of the carotid artery, typically at the site of a previous carotid endarterectomy or carotid artery injury. This condition can cause symptoms similar to those of a stroke, but it is not associated with a pulsatile mass in the chest wall.

Subclavian pseudoaneurysm (choice B) is a rare condition that occurs when there is a dilatation of the subclavian artery, which is a branch of the aortic arch that supplies blood to the left arm. This condition can cause symptoms similar to those

**Answer**:C. Check a rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test.

The correct answer is C. Check a rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test because the patient's symptoms of fever and rash, along with the liver biopsy findings of interface and lobular hepatitis with plasma cells and periportal cholestasis, suggest a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis. The patient's history of HIV infection and recent initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) increase the likelihood of this diagnosis.

A rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test is a rapid diagnostic test used to detect syphilis, which can cause autoimmune hepatitis. The patient's rash and fever, which are symptoms of syphilis, support the need for an RPR test. A positive RPR test would confirm the diagnosis of syphilis and guide treatment.

Option A, stopping atorvastatin secondary to statin-associated hepatitis, is incorrect because there is no evidence to suggest that the patient's liver dysfunction is related to atorvastatin use. While statins can cause liver damage, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are more consistent with autoimmune hepatitis.

Option B, continuing prednisone and azathioprine for autoimmune hepatitis, is incorrect because while these medications are commonly used to treat autoimmune hepatitis, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a different diagnosis. The patient's rash and fever are not typical symptoms of autoimmune hepatitis, and the liver biopsy findings do not support this diagnosis.

Option D, biopsy the skin lesions, is incorrect because the patient's skin lesions are not typical of autoimmune hepatitis. While skin lesions can occur in autoimmune hepatitis, they are usually not macular or pigmented. A skin biopsy would not provide useful diagnostic information in this case.

**Answer**:A. Rule out PE and perform a work up for alternative diagnoses.

The correct answer is A because the patient's chest film was normal, and his pretest clinical probability of PE according to the 2-level Wells score was only likely (1.5 points for heart rate >100, and 3.0 for other diagnoses less likely than PE). Therefore, it is appropriate to rule out PE and consider alternative diagnoses, such as anxiety or other cardiovascular conditions, that may be causing the patient's symptoms.

Choice B, obtaining a bilateral lower limb veins compression ultrasonography, may be appropriate if the patient had a history of cancer, venous thrombosis, or recent surgery, trauma, or admission to hospital, but these risk factors are not present in this case.

Choice C, obtaining a lung ventilation-perfusion (V̇/Q̇) scan or pulmonary angiogram, may be appropriate if the patient's pretest clinical probability of PE was higher, but it is not necessary at this point given the patient's low pretest probability and normal chest film.

Choice D, testing for D-dimer, may be appropriate if the patient's pretest clinical probability of PE was higher, but it is not necessary at this point given the patient's low pretest probability and normal chest film. Additionally, D-dimer testing is not recommended in patients with a low pretest probability of PE, as it may increase the likelihood of false positive results.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with secondary syphilis. The erythematous papules and vesicles on the palms, soles, and oropharynx are characteristic of the condition. The patient's history of myalgias and fatigue also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the elevated coxsackievirus titer suggests a viral infection, which is consistent with syphilis.

**Answer**: A. Rocky Mountain spotted fever

Rocky Mountain spotted fever is a tick-borne illness caused by Rickettsia rickettsii. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not match the typical presentation of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, which typically includes fever, headache, and a characteristic rash.

**Answer**: C. Hand, foot, and mouth disease

Hand, foot, and mouth disease is a viral illness that is commonly seen in children. The patient's age and the presence of vesicles on the palate and oropharynx make this diagnosis less likely.

**Answer**: D. Primary human immunodeficiency virus infection

Primary human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection can cause a variety of symptoms, including oral lesions and rash. However, the patient's history of sex with men and the presence of genital lesions are not consistent with primary HIV infection. Additionally, the patient's symptoms of myalgias and fatigue are not typically seen in primary HIV infection.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is secondary syphilis.

The correct answer is D: Cutaneous mucormycosis.

Mucormycosis is a fungal infection caused by the order Mucorales, which typically affects immunocompromised individuals. The patient's history of allogenic bone marrow transplant and chronic graft-vs-host disease puts him at high risk for developing this type of infection. The clinical presentation of a nonhealing ulcer with central eschar, along with the histopathological findings of numerous nonseptate, thick-walled fungal hyphae in the dermis, is consistent with cutaneous mucormycosis.

Now, let's discuss why the other answer choices are incorrect:

A: Pyoderma gangrenosum is a neutrophilic dermatosis that can present with ulceration, but it typically occurs in the setting of systemic inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease or hematological malignancies. The patient's history and clinical presentation do not suggest this diagnosis.

B: Squamous cell carcinoma is a malignant tumor that can arise from the skin, but it does not present with the characteristic eschar and surrounding erythema seen in mucormycosis.

C: Cutaneous aspergillosis is another type of fungal infection that can affect the skin, but it typically presents with papules, pustules, or nodules, rather than the ulcerative lesion seen in mucormycosis.

Therefore, based on the patient's history, clinical presentation, and histopathological findings, the most likely diagnosis is cutaneous mucormycosis.

The correct answer is C. Cold agglutinin disease, as it aligns with the patient's symptoms and clinical findings.

A. Relapsing polychondritis is an autoimmune disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of inflammation and damage to cartilage and connective tissue. While it can affect the ears, the patient's symptoms and clinical findings do not support this diagnosis. The patient does not report any history of recurrent episodes, and the biopsy results do not show significant inflammation of blood vessel walls.

B. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener granulomatosis) is a systemic vasculitis that affects small and medium-sized blood vessels. While it can cause ear lesions, the patient's clinical findings and biopsy results do not support this diagnosis. The patient does not report any respiratory symptoms, and the biopsy results do not show any evidence of granulomas or vasculitis.

D. Chilblain is a condition that causes painful, itchy, and inflamed skin lesions in response to cold and humidity. While it can affect the ears, the patient's symptoms and clinical findings do not support this diagnosis. The patient's lesions are not itchy, and there is no evidence of skin thickening or scaling.

Cold agglutinin disease, on the other hand, is an autoimmune disorder that causes the formation of antibodies against red blood cells, leading to their destruction and the formation of thrombi in blood vessels. The patient's symptoms, such as burning sensation, erythema, edema, and purpura, are consistent with this diagnosis. The biopsy results also support this diagnosis, as they show thrombi within engorged blood vessels. Additionally, the patient's history of exposure to cold and damp environment while out on his boat suggests that cold exposure may trigger or exacerbate the condition.

Therefore, C. Cold agglutinin disease is the correct answer.

The correct answer is C, Perform an eyelid nodule biopsy, because it is the most appropriate next step in the evaluation and management of the patients' condition.

The patients present with bilateral eyelid nodules that are impairing eyelid closure, along with other systemic findings such as dysphonia, oral mucosal lesions, alopecia, and recurrent parotitis. The older brother has a long history of unexplained medical conditions, and the younger brother has similar, although less severe, findings.

Given the patients' symptoms and medical history, it is important to consider the possibility of an underlying genetic or autoimmune disorder. A biopsy of the eyelid nodules would allow for a histopathological evaluation and potentially provide a diagnosis or guide further management.

Option A, Administer hyperfocal cryotherapy to the eyelid nodules, is not appropriate at this stage, as it is a treatment for benign eyelid lesions and would not provide a diagnosis or address any underlying systemic condition.

Option B, Start D-penicillamine therapy, is also not appropriate, as there is no indication for this medication based on the patients' symptoms and medical history. D-penicillamine is used to treat Wilson's disease, a rare genetic disorder that causes copper accumulation in the body, and would not be effective for an autoimmune or genetic disorder causing eyelid nodules.

Option D, Assess for enlarged tongue with decreased motility, is not relevant to the patients' symptoms or medical history and would not provide a diagnosis or guide further management.

Therefore, the best next step would be to perform an eyelid nodule biopsy to further evaluate the patients' condition and guide management.

**Answer**: A. Perform a serum test for autoantibodies

The patient's symptoms of painless horizontal diplopia, bilateral abduction deficit, and esotropia on lateral gaze suggest a possible diagnosis of myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disorder that affects the nervous system and causes muscle weakness. The absence of intracranial lesions or extraocular muscle myositis on MRI and the normal findings from external examination, pupils, intraocular pressure, and visual fields support this diagnosis.

Performing a serum test for autoantibodies, choice A, is the next step in diagnosing myasthenia gravis. This test can help confirm the presence of autoantibodies against the acetylcholine receptor, which is a hallmark of the disease. If the test is positive, it would support the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis and guide further management.

On the other hand, choice B, performing a tensilon test, may also be considered in the evaluation of myasthenia gravis, but it is not the most appropriate next step. A tensilon test is used to confirm the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis by testing the patient's response to edrophonium, a cholinesterase inhibitor. However, a positive result may not always indicate myasthenia gravis, and a negative result does not rule out the diagnosis. Therefore, a serum test for autoantibodies is a more specific and sensitive test for diagnosing myasthenia gravis.

Choice C, performing magnetic resonance venography, is not relevant to the patient's current symptoms and diagnosis. While MRI can help diagnose various neurological conditions, it is not specific to myasthenia gravis. Moreover, the patient has already undergone MRI, which did not reveal any infectious involvement of the orbits or petromastoid complexes.

Lastly, choice D, restarting antibiotic treatment and arranging for an otorhinolaryngology follow-up examination, may be appropriate for managing the patient's sinusitis, but it does not address

**Answer**:C. Recurrent painful ophthalmoplegic neuropathy

The patient's symptoms of recurrent right-sided ptosis, severe headache, and double vision, along with the absence of other neurological symptoms, suggest a diagnosis of recurrent painful ophthalmoplegic neuropathy (RPON). This is a rare condition characterized by recurrent episodes of painful weakness or paralysis of the oculomotor nerve, which controls the movement of the eyelid and eye. The patient's family history of migraine and the absence of other autoimmune disorders or cerebral aneurysms support this diagnosis.

The MRI findings of thickening of the cisternal part of the right third cranial nerve in the perimesencephalic cistern also support this diagnosis, as RPON is associated with inflammation and swelling of the cranial nerves, particularly the third nerve. The normal results of the lumbar puncture and cerebrospinal fluid tests also argue against a diagnosis of meningitis or other central nervous system infections.

The other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms:

A. Recurrent meningitis: While meningitis can cause headache and vomiting, it is unlikely to cause isolated ptosis and double vision without other neurological symptoms. The patient's history of recurrent episodes and the absence of fever also argue against this diagnosis.

B. Posterior communicating artery aneurysm: This is a rare condition that can cause oculomotor nerve palsy, but it is unlikely to cause recurrent episodes of ptosis and headache without other neurological symptoms. The patient's age and lack of other symptoms also make this diagnosis less likely.

D. Myasthenia: Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder that can cause weakness or paralysis of the muscles, including the oculomotor nerve. However, the patient's symptoms of recurrent episodes of ptosis and headache, along with the absence of other muscle weakness or fatigue, argue against this diagnosis

Malignant melanoma is a type of cancer that develops from the pigment-producing cells called melanocytes. It is a malignant tumor that can occur in various parts of the body, including the nasopharynx. However, the patient's history, physical examination, and histopathological findings do not support this diagnosis. The patient does not have a history of melanoma, and the lesion is not ulcerated or bleeding. The histopathological findings show small mixed serous and mucinous glands, normal respiratory epithelia with marked oncocytic cell changes, and abundant eosinophilic granular cytoplasm arranged in a tubular and microcystic pattern, which are not consistent with the features of malignant melanoma.

B. Metastatic melanoma:
Metastatic melanoma occurs when cancer cells from a primary melanoma tumor spread to other parts of the body. The patient's history and physical examination do not suggest a primary melanoma tumor, and the histopathological findings do not support this diagnosis. The lesion is not ulcerated or bleeding, and the histopathological features are not consistent with metastatic melanoma.

D. Hemangioma:
Hemangioma is a benign tumor that arises from the abnormal growth of blood vessels. It can occur in various parts of the body, including the nasopharynx. However, the patient's history, physical examination, and histopathological findings do not support this diagnosis. The patient does not have a history of hemangioma, and the lesion is not characteristic of hemangioma.

**Answer**: C. Myositis ossificans traumatica

Myositis ossificans traumatica is a condition where there is bony growth in the muscles, usually as a result of trauma. In this case, the patient had a history of trismus, which is a condition where the muscles of mastication (chewing muscles) become rigid and unable to move, leading to difficulty opening the mouth. The patient had a dental abscess, which could have caused the trauma that led to the bony growth in the muscles.

The other choices are not correct for the following reasons:

A. Lymphoma: Lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the immune system. While it can cause a variety of symptoms, including swelling and pain in the affected area, it is not typically associated with trismus or bony growth in the muscles.

B. Osteosarcoma: Osteosarcoma is a type of bone cancer that can cause bony growths, but it is typically a primary bone tumor, meaning it originates in the bone itself, rather than in the muscles.

D. Tumoral calcinosis: Tumoral calcinosis is a condition where there is abnormal calcium deposition in soft tissues, such as muscles or organs. While it can cause similar symptoms to myositis ossificans traumatica, such as rigidity and limited mobility, it is not typically associated with a history of trauma.

Therefore, based on the patient's history and symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is myositis ossificans traumatica.

**Answer**: C. Chronic invasive fungal sinusitis

The patient's symptoms of nasal drainage, severe headaches, and long-standing visual loss, along with the physical examination findings of severe left proptosis, telecanthus, and purulent nasal drainage, are consistent with chronic sinusitis. The computed tomographic imaging findings of extensive nasal polyposis, bony remodeling consistent with long-standing inflammation, and massive erosion of the bilateral skull base and orbits also support this diagnosis.

The patient's history of previous nasal endoscopy with biopsy of nasal polyps 6 years previously, with a finding of benign nasal polyps by surgical pathology, suggests that the patient has a history of chronic sinusitis. The atypical, fibrotic endoscopic appearance of the nasal polyps noted during the current endoscopic sinus surgery, along with the difficulty in removing them even with powered instrumentation, also support the diagnosis of chronic invasive fungal sinusitis.

Allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (choice A) is a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's history of chronic sinusitis and the presence of bony remodeling. Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (choice B) is a rare possibility, but it is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and imaging findings. Chronic rhinosinusitis with polyposis (choice D) is a possible diagnosis, but it does not fully explain the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, imaging findings, and history, the most likely diagnosis is chronic invasive fungal sinusitis.

**Answer**: C. Radiation-induced neurofibroma

The correct answer is C. Radiation-induced neurofibroma because the patient's symptoms and the pathological findings are consistent with this diagnosis.

The patient's symptoms of foreign body sensation in the throat, mild odynophagia, and dyspnea, as well as the physical examination findings of a bulge in the floor of the mouth and limitation of tongue movement, are consistent with a neurofibroma. Neurofibromas are benign tumors that arise from the Schwann cells that surround nerves, and they can occur in any part of the body. Radiation-induced neurofibromas are a known complication of radiation therapy, and they can occur many years after the initial radiation exposure.

The pathological findings also support the diagnosis of radiation-induced neurofibroma. The tumor is composed of oval to eel-like spindle nuclei distributed in a background of generally wavy collagenous fibers and mucinous matrix, which is consistent with the histopathological features of a neurofibroma. Additionally, the tumor is immunoreactive for S-100, which is a marker for Schwann cells, further supporting the diagnosis.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Recurrent adenoid cystic carcinoma is unlikely because the patient had a history of adenoid cystic carcinoma of the right submandibular gland, but the current tumor is located in the floor of the mouth, which is a different location. Additionally, the histopathological features of the tumor do not support this diagnosis.

B. Radiation-induced liposarcoma is unlikely because the tumor does not have the characteristic histopathological features of a liposarcoma, such as a lipomatous component.

D. Radiation-induced rhabdomyosarcoma is unlikely because the patient's age and the histopathological features of the tumor do not support this diagnosis. Rhabdomyosarcoma

**Answer**: D. Laryngeal sarcoidosis

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with laryngeal sarcoidosis. The patient has a history of sarcoidosis, which is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect various organs, including the larynx. The patient's symptoms of sore throat, fever, chills, productive cough, globus sensation, dysphagia, and hoarse voice, as well as the physical examination findings of mildly tender right cervical lymphadenopathy and diffuse swelling of the supraglottic structures, particularly the epiglottis and left aryepiglottic fold, with a pale appearance of the mucosa, are all consistent with laryngeal sarcoidosis. The patient's history of hypertension, asthma, and obstructive sleep apnea may also be relevant to the patient's overall health and potential treatment plan, but they are not directly related to the likely diagnosis of laryngeal sarcoidosis.

The other answer choices are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

A. Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma: This is a type of cancer that affects the larynx. While it is possible that the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings could be due to laryngeal cancer, the patient's history of sarcoidosis and the absence of any signs of infection make laryngeal sarcoidosis a more likely diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's age in her 30s is relatively young for laryngeal cancer, which is typically seen in older adults.

B. Angioedema: This is a condition characterized by sudden swelling of the face, lips, tongue, throat, or hands. While angioedema can cause throat swelling and difficulty swallowing, it is not typically associated with a pale appearance of the mucosa or patchy enhancement and narrowing of the airway, as seen on the patient's neck CT scan.

**Answer**:B. Refer for ophthalmologic examination and orbital computed tomography.

The correct answer is B because the patient's symptoms of a red and swollen eyelid, along with the presence of cervical lymphadenopathy, suggest a possible orbital infection or inflammation. An ophthalmologic examination and orbital computed tomography (CT) scan are necessary to further evaluate the cause of the patient's symptoms and to rule out any serious complications.

Option A, recommending eyelid scrubs for blepharitis, may not be effective in treating the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, as blepharitis is an inflammation of the eyelid margin, and the patient's symptoms suggest a more severe condition.

Option C, prescribing oral amoxicillin sodium-clavulanate potassium for infectious preseptal cellulitis, may be appropriate if the patient's symptoms are caused by an infection, but it is not the most appropriate next step in the patient's management. Prescribing antibiotics without proper evaluation and diagnosis may lead to inappropriate treatment and potential harm to the patient.

Option D, obtaining a positron-emission tomographic (PET) scan to identify metastases, is not relevant to the patient's current symptoms and medical history. The patient's history of breast cancer and absence of any signs or symptoms suggestive of metastatic disease do not support the need for a PET scan at this time.

**Answer**: C. Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC)

The correct answer is C. Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC) because it best fits the patient's symptoms and test results described in the case.

A. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma: This is an incorrect choice because the patient's symptoms and test results do not suggest lymphoma. The patient did not present with lymphadenopathy, fever, or weight loss, which are common symptoms of lymphoma. Additionally, the imaging results did not show any evidence of lymphoma.

B. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST): This is an incorrect choice because GISTs are rare in the liver and pancreas, and the patient's symptoms and test results do not suggest a GIST. The patient did not present with abdominal pain or bleeding, which are common symptoms of GISTs. Additionally, the imaging results did not show any evidence of a GIST.

D. Neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas: This is an incorrect choice because the patient's symptoms and test results do not suggest a neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas. The patient did not present with symptoms such as abdominal pain, weight loss, or diarrhea, which are common symptoms of neuroendocrine tumors. Additionally, the imaging results did not show any evidence of a neuroendocrine tumor.

C. Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC): This is the correct choice because it best fits the patient's symptoms and test results. FL-HCC is a rare type of liver cancer that can occur in young adults and often presents with non-specific symptoms such as abdominal pain or discomfort. The imaging results showed two large masses in the liver and pancreas, which is consistent with FL-HCC. The patient's age and symptoms, along with the imaging results, suggest FL-HCC as the most likely diagnosis

**Answer**:B. Meckel diverticulum

The patient's symptoms of intermittent abdominal pain, nausea, and nonbilious emesis, along with the physical examination findings of mild abdominal distension and tenderness, are consistent with a possible diagnosis of Meckel diverticulum. This is a congenital anomaly that occurs when a remnant of the omphalomesenteric duct fails to obliterate during fetal development, resulting in a communication between the small intestine and the peritoneal cavity. The presence of a cystic pelvic mass containing irregularly shaped ossifications, as revealed by computed tomography, is also consistent with Meckel diverticulum.

The other options are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and findings:

A. Pelvic teratoma: A teratoma is a benign tumor that can occur in the pelvis, but it is unlikely to cause the symptoms described in this case. Teratomas are typically slow-growing and may not cause symptoms until they are large enough to compress surrounding structures. Additionally, the presence of ossifications within the cystic mass suggests that it is not a teratoma.

C. Enteric duplication cyst: Enteric duplication cysts are rare congenital anomalies that occur when there is a duplication of a portion of the small intestine. They can cause abdominal pain and other symptoms, but the presence of a cystic pelvic mass containing ossifications is not typical of enteric duplication cysts.

D. Carcinoid tumor: Carcinoid tumors are rare tumors that can occur in the gastrointestinal tract, but they are unlikely to cause the symptoms described in this case. They are typically slow-growing and may not cause symptoms until they are large enough to compress surrounding structures. Additionally, the presence of ossifications within the cystic mass suggests that it is not a carcinoid tumor.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Meckel diverticulum.

**Answer**:C. Order a complete blood cell count with differential to rule out a hematologic disorder

The correct answer is C. Order a complete blood cell count with differential to rule out a hematologic disorder, as it is the most appropriate next step in the evaluation of this patient's recurrent oral ulcers.

A. Obtain a biopsy of the ulcer may be considered, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this point. While a biopsy may help to establish a definitive diagnosis, it is invasive and carries risks. In this case, the patient's history and physical examination findings suggest a possible diagnosis of recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS), which is a common condition that can cause recurrent oral ulcers. Therefore, it is more appropriate to start with less invasive and less costly diagnostic tests before considering a biopsy.

B. Prescribe valacyclovir (1000 mg) 3 times daily for the next 7 days is not the most appropriate next step. While valacyclovir may be effective in treating herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections, which can cause oral ulcers, there is no indication that the patient has an HSV infection. The patient's history and physical examination findings suggest RAS, which is not caused by HSV.

D. Prescribe amoxicillin (500 mg) 3 times daily for the next 7 days is also not the most appropriate next step. While amoxicillin may be effective in treating bacterial infections, there is no indication that the patient has a bacterial infection. The patient's history and physical examination findings suggest RAS, which is not caused by bacteria.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to order a complete blood cell count with differential to rule out a hematologic disorder, which can cause recurrent oral ulcers. This test can help to identify possible causes of the ulcers, such as anemia, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia, and guide further management.

The correct answer is C. Mixed obstructive and restrictive abnormality.

A. Primarily restrictive abnormality: This choice is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest both obstruction and restriction. The patient's history of smoking and the presence of inspiratory crackles and diminished breath sounds at the apices suggest obstruction, while the decreased lung volume and increased respiratory rate suggest restriction.

B. Obstructive abnormality with pseudorestriction: This choice is incorrect because pseudorestriction is a phenomenon that occurs in obstructive lung disease, where the lung volume is artificially increased due to the inability to exhale completely. In this case, the patient's lung volume is decreased, suggesting a true restrictive abnormality rather than pseudorestriction.

D. Spirometry cannot be used to evaluate for obstruction in the setting of a restrictive abnormality: This choice is incorrect because spirometry can be used to evaluate for both obstruction and restriction. While it is true that spirometry may not be able to accurately measure forced expiratory volume in patients with severe restriction, it can still provide valuable information about the patient's lung function and can help distinguish between obstructive and restrictive abnormalities.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Mixed obstructive and restrictive abnormality, as the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a combination of both obstruction and restriction.

**Answer**: D. Do nothing now but repeat CT scan in 3 to 6 months

Explanation:

A. Refer to medical oncology:
This choice is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not suggest a diagnosis of cancer. While the patient's weight loss, tremor, diaphoresis, and palpitations could be symptoms of a hypermetabolic state, the absence of eye symptoms or muscle weakness suggests that the cause is unlikely to be a thyroid cancer. Additionally, the patient's thyroid function test results show hyperthyroidism, which is not consistent with a diagnosis of cancer.

B. Perform biopsy of the thymus:
This choice is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not suggest a diagnosis of a thymic neoplasm. The patient's hyperthyroidism and the presence of a diffusely enlarged thyroid gland suggest a thyroid disorder, rather than a thymic disorder. Furthermore, the patient's thymus is not visible on the CT scan, making a biopsy difficult and unnecessary.

C. Refer to surgery for removal of the thymus:
This choice is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not suggest a diagnosis of a thymic neoplasm that would require surgical intervention. Additionally, the patient's hyperthyroidism suggests that the thymus is not the cause of her symptoms.

D. Do nothing now but repeat CT scan in 3 to 6 months:
This choice is correct because it allows for further monitoring of the patient's condition without immediate intervention. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest hyperthyroidism, which can cause an enlarged thymus. Repeating the CT scan in 3 to 6 months will allow for assessment of any changes in the thymus and thyroid gland, and determine if further intervention is necessary. It also gives the patient time to consider their options and discuss further testing or treatment with their healthcare provider.

**Answer**: B. Infantile myofibromatosis

Infantile myofibromatosis is a rare benign tumor that occurs in infants and young children. It is characterized by the proliferation of immature fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, which can result in the formation of nodular lesions on the skin or in the soft tissues. The tumor tends to regress spontaneously over time, and the prognosis is generally excellent.

In this case, the patient presented with a nodular lesion on the scalp that had been present since birth. The lesion had a firm, exophytic, and flat-topped texture, with superficial erosion and crusting. The patient's parents reported occasional erosions and crusting that resolved with topical mupirocin, but there was no continued growth. The patient had a normal pregnancy and birth, and there was no evidence of visceral involvement. These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of infantile myofibromatosis.

The histopathologic and immunohistochemical images of the biopsy specimen showed features consistent with infantile myofibromatosis, including a proliferation of immature fibroblasts and myofibroblasts, and a positive actin stain.

The other answer choices are less likely diagnoses for this patient's condition.

A. Giant cell fibroblastoma is a rare benign tumor that occurs in the soft tissues, particularly in the extremities. It is characterized by the presence of giant cells, which are multinucleated cells with a fibroblastic or myofibroblastic appearance. While giant cell fibroblastoma can occur in children, it is less common than infantile myofibromatosis, and the clinical and histopathologic features are distinct.

The correct answer is B: Cytomegalovirus ulcer.

Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a viral infection that can cause a variety of diseases, including ulcers, in immunocompromised individuals. The patient's history of immunosuppressive therapy following a heart transplant and the presence of a rapidly enlarging ulcer with a base of purulent debris are consistent with CMV ulcer. The histopathologic findings of enlarged endothelial cells with intranuclear inclusions surrounded by a clear halo and cytoplasmic inclusions in some macrophages are also consistent with CMV infection.

Ecthyma gangrenosum (Option A) is a skin infection that can occur in immunocompromised individuals, but it typically presents with small, painful, umbilicated lesions that progress to ulcers. The patient's ulcer is larger and has a different appearance.

Mucormycosis ulcer (Option C) is a fungal infection that can cause skin ulcers in immunocompromised individuals. However, the patient's ulcer does not have the characteristic appearance of mucormycosis, which typically has a black, necrotic center and a surrounding erythematous border.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (Option D) is a skin infection that can occur in immunocompromised individuals, but it typically presents with small, painful, necrotic ulcers that are surrounded by a red halo. The patient's ulcer is larger and has a different appearance.

Therefore, based on the patient's history, physical examination, and histopathologic findings, the most likely diagnosis is Cytomegalovirus ulcer.

**Answer**: C. Type I cryoglobulinemia associated with multiple myeloma

The correct answer is C, Type I cryoglobulinemia associated with multiple myeloma, because the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with this diagnosis.

Type I cryoglobulinemia is a condition where the body produces abnormal proteins called cryoglobulins, which can cause blood clots to form in small blood vessels. This can lead to symptoms such as purpura (bleeding under the skin), which is seen in the patient's case.

Multiple myeloma is a type of cancer that affects the plasma cells in the bone marrow. It is known that patients with multiple myeloma can develop cryoglobulinemia. In this case, the patient's history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy and chronic kidney disease suggests that they may have underlying medical conditions that increase the risk of developing multiple myeloma.

The patient's laboratory results also support this diagnosis. The patient's calcium level is elevated (hypercalcemia), which is a common finding in patients with multiple myeloma. Additionally, the patient's creatinine level is elevated, indicating acute kidney injury, which is a common complication of multiple myeloma.

The patient's skin lesions, which are described as dusky purpuric macules and patches, are consistent with the purpura seen in Type I cryoglobulinemia. The fact that the lesions are found on the extensor surfaces of the arms and legs, as well as on the face, is also consistent with this diagnosis.

The other answer choices do not fit the patient's symptoms and laboratory results as well as choice C.

Leukocytoclastic vasculitis (choice A) is a condition where the blood vessels are inflamed and damaged, leading to symptoms such as purpura. However, the patient's laboratory results do not suggest this diagnosis, as there is no evidence of inflammation or immune system dysfunction.

**Answer**: D. Treat with combined systemic chemotherapy and pars plana vitrectomy

The correct answer is D, Treat with combined systemic chemotherapy and pars plana vitrectomy, because it addresses both the underlying systemic disease (Waldenström macroglobulinemia) and the ocular complications (choroidal detachment, vitreous hemorrhage, and suprachoroidal effusion).

**Option A**: Observe the patient

Observation alone is not sufficient for this patient, as she has active WM with bone marrow involvement and ocular complications that require prompt treatment.

**Option B**: Perform pars plana vitrectomy

Pars plana vitrectomy is a surgical procedure that removes the vitreous gel and can help improve vision in cases of vitreous hemorrhage. However, it does not address the underlying systemic disease or the choroidal detachment, which is a significant complication of WM.

**Option C**: Treat with systemic chemotherapy

Systemic chemotherapy is a necessary component of treatment for WM, but it does not directly address the ocular complications. In this case, the patient has already been diagnosed with active WM, and chemotherapy alone would not be sufficient to manage the choroidal detachment and vitreous hemorrhage.

Therefore, the best answer is D, Treat with combined systemic chemotherapy and pars plana vitrectomy, which provides a comprehensive approach to managing both the systemic and ocular complications of this patient's condition.

**Answer**:C. Photodynamic therapy

The patient in the case presented with a serous retinal detachment (SRD) involving the macula, which is a complication of enucleation. SRD is caused by fluid accumulation between the retina and the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), leading to vision loss if left untreated.

C. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is the correct answer because it is a minimally invasive treatment that has been shown to be effective in reducing fluid leakage and improving vision in patients with SRD. PDT works by selectively damaging the abnormal choroidal blood vessels, leading to a reduction in fluid leakage and promoting reattachment of the retina.

A. Systemic corticosteroid therapy is an incorrect choice because corticosteroids have not been shown to be effective in treating SRD. While corticosteroids can reduce inflammation, they do not address the underlying cause of the fluid accumulation.

B. Observation is an incorrect choice because SRD can lead to permanent vision loss if left untreated. The patient has already experienced significant vision loss, and close monitoring without treatment may not be sufficient to prevent further vision loss.

D. Antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy is an incorrect choice because VEGF is not the primary cause of SRD. While VEGF can contribute to the development of SRD, the primary mechanism is related to the abnormal choroidal blood vessels. PDT is a more targeted approach that specifically addresses the abnormal choroidal vessels, whereas anti-VEGF therapy may not effectively address the underlying cause of the SRD.

In summary, C. Photodynamic therapy is the most appropriate treatment option for this patient with SRD following enucleation, as it selectively targets the abnormal choroidal blood vessels and has been shown to improve vision and reduce fluid leakage in similar cases.

**Answer**: B. Lymphatic malformation

The correct answer is B. Lymphatic malformation because it best fits the patient's symptoms and the findings on the abdominal radiograph and computed tomographic scan.

A lymphatic malformation is a congenital abnormality that occurs when the lymphatic vessels fail to develop properly. It can cause a cystic mass to form in the retroperitoneum, which is the area behind the abdominal organs. The cystic mass can become large enough to displace the nearby organs, which is what is seen in this patient's CT scan. The mass effect on the abdominal viscera and the displacement of the right kidney superiorly under the liver are both consistent with a retroperitoneal cystic mass.

The patient's lack of symptoms, such as abdominal pain or fever, also supports the diagnosis of a lymphatic malformation. These malformations are usually asymptomatic, and patients may not experience any symptoms until the cystic mass becomes large enough to compress nearby organs.

The other answer choices do not fit the patient's symptoms and imaging findings as well.

A. Retroperitoneal abscess: An abscess is a collection of pus that forms in response to an infection. It would not cause a cystic mass in the retroperitoneum and would likely cause symptoms such as fever, chills, and abdominal pain, which the patient does not have.

C. Urinoma: A urinoma is a cystic mass that forms in the kidney or ureter. It would not cause a cystic mass in the retroperitoneum and would likely cause symptoms such as flank pain, hematuria, and urinary tract infection, which the patient does not have.

D. Pancreatic pseudocyst: A pancreatic pseudocyst is a fluid-filled cavity that forms in the pancreas. It would not cause a cystic mass in the retroperitoneum and would likely cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, which the patient does not have

A: Fungal ball is a possible diagnosis, as the patient's symptoms of nasal congestion, facial pain, and vision change, as well as the CT scan findings of complete opacification and an invasive process centered in the right maxillary sinus, are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the presence of numerous fungal organisms consistent with Aspergillus species, as well as the patient's history of weight loss and facial swelling, suggest a more invasive and aggressive process, which is not typical of a fungal ball.

B: Chronic invasive fungal sinusitis is a possible diagnosis, as the patient's symptoms and CT scan findings are consistent with this diagnosis. However, the presence of a fungal ball and the patient's history of weight loss and facial swelling suggest a more aggressive and invasive process, which is not typical of chronic invasive fungal sinusitis.

C: Invasive squamous cell carcinoma is a possible diagnosis, as the patient's symptoms of facial pain and vision change, as well as the CT scan findings of erosion of the bony walls, are consistent with this diagnosis. The presence of numerous fungal organisms consistent with Aspergillus species suggests that the patient may have a fungal infection that is associated with the squamous cell carcinoma.

D: Fungal ball and invasive squamous cell carcinoma is the correct diagnosis, as it takes into account all of the patient's symptoms and CT scan findings, as well as the presence of numerous fungal organisms consistent with Aspergillus species. This diagnosis suggests that the patient has a fungal infection that is associated with the squamous cell carcinoma, which is a more aggressive and invasive process than a fungal ball or chronic invasive fungal sinusitis.

**Answer**:B. Well-differentiated liposarcoma of the larynx

The patient's symptoms of a foreign body sensation in the throat, choking, and voice fatigue, along with the fibroscope and biopsy results, suggest a diagnosis of a well-differentiated liposarcoma of the larynx. This type of cancer is a rare type of soft tissue sarcoma that affects the larynx and is characterized by a slow-growing mass that can cause symptoms such as dysphagia, odynophagia, and vocal cord paralysis. The patient's history of smoking may also be a contributing factor to the development of this type of cancer.

The other options are not correct for the following reasons:

A. Hemangioma of the larynx: Hemangioma is a benign tumor that is composed of blood vessels, and it is not typically associated with symptoms such as a foreign body sensation in the throat or choking.

C. Schwannoma of the larynx: Schwannoma, also known as a neurilemmoma, is a benign tumor that originates from the supporting cells of the nerve. It is not typically associated with symptoms such as a foreign body sensation in the throat or choking, and it does not have the same histological features as liposarcoma.

D. Laryngocele of the larynx: Laryngocele is a rare condition characterized by a cystic mass in the larynx. It is not typically associated with symptoms such as a foreign body sensation in the throat or choking, and it does not have the same histological features as liposarcoma.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, medical history, and test results, the most likely diagnosis is well-differentiated liposarcoma of the larynx.

The patient's symptoms of bilateral upper extremity numbness and paresthesias, along with the MRI findings of a T2 hyperintense lesion within the right pterygoid muscles, are consistent with a venous malformation. The presence of a small focus of signal void on the T2-weighted images, suspicious for tiny calcification, and the sequential increased enhancement on the postcontrast T1-weighted axial images, are also consistent with a venous malformation.

The SPECT-CT findings of increased tracer pooling within the lesion further support the diagnosis of a venous malformation. Venous malformations are known to have increased blood flow and dilated vessels, which can lead to increased tracer uptake on SPECT-CT imaging.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Rhabdomyosarcoma: Rhabdomyosarcoma is a type of soft tissue sarcoma that can occur in the head and neck region. However, the patient's symptoms and MRI findings are not consistent with rhabdomyosarcoma. Rhabdomyosarcoma typically presents with rapidly growing masses that can infiltrate surrounding tissues, and the MRI findings are typically more aggressive, with significant mass effect and edema.

C. Masticator space abscess: A masticator space abscess is a collection of pus in the masticator space, which is a compartment in the temporal bone that contains the temporalis muscle and the mandibular nerve. The patient's symptoms of bilateral upper extremity numbness and paresthesias are not consistent with a masticator space abscess, which typically presents with unilateral symptoms and signs of infection such as fever, pain, and swelling.

The correct answer is B. Adult rhabdomyoma because it matches the given case's clinical and pathological features.

A. Paraganglioma is an incorrect choice because it is a rare tumor that arises from paraganglia, which are clusters of cells located near the sympathetic nerve fibers in the body. Although it can occur in the head and neck, paraganglioma typically presents with symptoms related to cranial nerve dysfunction, hypertension, and palpitations, which are not seen in this case. Moreover, the histopathological features of paraganglioma, such as the presence of ganglion cells, are not observed in the image provided.

C. Squamous cell carcinoma is an incorrect choice because it is a malignant tumor that arises from the squamous epithelium and typically presents with ulceration, bleeding, and lymph node metastasis. The given case does not mention any of these symptoms, and the histopathological features of squamous cell carcinoma, such as keratinization and intercellular bridges, are not seen in the image provided.

D. Sarcoidosis is an incorrect choice because it is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by the formation of granulomas, which are clusters of immune cells that accumulate in response to an unknown antigen. Although sarcoidosis can affect various organs, including the head and neck, it typically presents with symptoms such as fatigue, fever, and skin rash, which are not seen in this case. Moreover, the histopathological features of sarcoidosis, such as the presence of granulomas, are not observed in the image provided.

In contrast, adult rhabdomyoma is a rare benign tumor that arises from the embryonic remnants of the rhabdomyoblasts, which are muscle cells that develop in the soft tissues.

**Answer**: B. Desmoid tumor

A desmoid tumor is a type of soft tissue tumor that originates from the connective tissue of the body, specifically from the fibroblasts. It is a benign tumor, meaning it is not cancerous and does not spread to other parts of the body. Desmoid tumors typically grow slowly and can occur in various parts of the body, but they are most commonly found in the abdomen, pelvis, and extremities.

The patient in the case presented with a 1-year history of a growing facial mass, which is consistent with the slow-growing nature of desmoid tumors. The location of the mass, extending from the mastoid to the zygoma and inferiorly to the angle of the mandible, is also consistent with the typical location of desmoid tumors in the head and neck region.

The patient's history of smoking and remote alcohol abuse may also be relevant, as there is some evidence to suggest that desmoid tumors are more common in people who have a history of smoking and alcohol consumption.

The histopathologic findings described in the case, including spindle cells arranged in long fascicles with abundant interstitial collagen, are also consistent with the characteristic features of desmoid tumors. Additionally, the tumor cells exhibited central, oval nuclei, and moderate amounts of pale-pink cytoplasm with indistinct borders, which is also consistent with the typical appearance of desmoid tumor cells.

Immunostaining demonstrated strong nuclear staining for β-catenin antibody and was positive for smooth muscle actin antibody, while stains for desmin, pan-keratin, S-100, CD34, and Bcl-2 antibodies were negative. This is also consistent with the typical immunophenotype of desmoid tumors, which are positive for β-catenin and smooth muscle actin, but negative for other markers such as desmin and S-100.

**Answer**: C. Adrenal myelolipoma

The correct answer is C. Adrenal myelolipoma, as it is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

A. Adrenal liposarcoma is an incorrect choice because it is a rare malignant tumor that typically affects the adrenal cortex, and is not associated with the symptoms described in the case.

B. Renal hamartoma is an incorrect choice because it is a benign tumor that occurs in the kidney, and is not associated with the symptoms described in the case.

D. Nonfunctional paraganglioma is an incorrect choice because it is a rare tumor that occurs in the paraganglia, and is not associated with the symptoms described in the case.

C. Adrenal myelolipoma, on the other hand, is a benign tumor that occurs in the adrenal gland and is composed of fat cells and immature bone. It is associated with symptoms such as abdominal pain, emesis, and tenderness on the left side, which are consistent with the patient's presentation. Additionally, the patient's laboratory results, including plasma levels of metanephrines, normetanephrines, cortisol, renin, and aldosterone within reference limits, are consistent with a diagnosis of adrenal myelolipoma.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, the most likely diagnosis is C. Adrenal myelolipoma.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain why C. Gastric duplication is the correct answer and why the other choices are incorrect.

**Answer**: C. Gastric duplication

Gastric duplication is a rare congenital anomaly that occurs when there is a duplicate layer of gastric mucosa and submucosa, resulting in a mass-like lesion in the stomach. The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, early satiety, and history of alcohol abuse are consistent with gastric duplication. The patient's history of hematemesis, or vomiting blood, is also consistent with this diagnosis, as gastric duplication can lead to bleeding complications.

The imaging findings, including the computed tomographic scan, magnetic resonance imaging, and upper endoscopy, show a heterogeneous mass lesion in the fundus and body of the stomach, which is consistent with gastric duplication. The biopsy results of normal gastric mucosa also support this diagnosis, as gastric duplication is made up of normal gastric mucosa.

Now, let's discuss why C. Gastric duplication is the correct answer and why the other choices are incorrect:

A. Leiomyosarcoma: Leiomyosarcoma is a type of smooth muscle tumor that can occur in the stomach, but it is not the most likely diagnosis in this case. The patient's symptoms and imaging findings are not consistent with leiomyosarcoma, which typically presents with abdominal pain, weight loss, and a large, firm mass in the abdomen. Additionally, leiomyosarcoma would not explain the patient's history of hematemesis.

B. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST): GIST is a type of tumor that occurs in the digestive system, but it is not the most likely diagnosis in this case. GIST typically presents with abdominal pain, weight loss, and a large, firm mass in the abdomen, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms. Additionally, GIST would not explain the patient's history of hematemesis.

The correct answer is C. Reassure the patient.

The patient in this case has a history of open-angle glaucoma in her right eye, and she has noticed a gradual darkening of her right iris and lengthening of her eyelashes over the past year. However, she denies any visual changes or foreign-body sensation. Given this history, it is possible that the patient may be experiencing some anxiety or concern about her eye health.

Reassuring the patient would be an appropriate next step in this case. The patient's concerns and symptoms should be acknowledged, and she should be informed that her condition is being monitored closely. The patient should also be advised to continue her current medications and follow-up appointments as scheduled.

The other answer choices are not appropriate for the following reasons:

A. Performing eye and orbit computed tomography (CT) would not be necessary at this time. While CT scans can be useful in evaluating eye and orbit disorders, they are not typically ordered for patients with a history of glaucoma and unilateral eyelash hypertrichosis without other symptoms or signs of orbital disease.

B. Ordering serologic studies, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate, antinuclear antibody titers, complete blood cell count, and basic chemistry panel, may be appropriate in certain cases, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's symptoms and history do not suggest a systemic inflammatory or autoimmune disorder that would require such testing.

D. Referring the patient to an ophthalmologist urgently for slit-lamp and dilated examination may be appropriate in certain cases, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. While a slit-lamp examination can help evaluate the patient's iris and eyelashes, it is not necessary on an urgent basis. The patient's symptoms and history suggest a gradual change in her iris color and eyelash length, which does not require immediate attention. A routine follow-up appointment with an ophthalmologist would be sufficient.

**Answer**:B. Obtain a biopsy of the skin lesion

The patient's symptoms of weight loss, dyspnea, nonproductive cough, subjective fevers, night sweats, and painful hematuria, along with the physical examination findings of numerous scattered red to violaceous macules and papules along his tattoos, suggest a systemic illness that may be related to his tattoos. The presence of bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy on chest radiography and right-sided hydronephrosis with an obstructive stone on computed tomography of the abdomen further support this possibility.

Biopsy of the skin lesion (choice B) is the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation. It will allow for a histopathological examination of the skin lesions, which can help to identify the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. The biopsy may reveal evidence of an immune-mediated disorder, such as a lupus-like syndrome, or an infectious process, such as bacterial or fungal infection.

Prescribing topical corticosteroids (choice A) may be appropriate for a skin rash, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's evaluation, as it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

Prescribing oral antibiotics (choice C) may be appropriate if an infectious process is suspected, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's evaluation, as there is no clear evidence of infection.

Ordering respiratory isolation and ruling out tuberculosis (choice D) may be appropriate if the patient had a positive purified protein derivative (PPD) test or other risk factors for tuberculosis, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's evaluation, as there is no clear evidence of tuberculosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Obtain a biopsy of the skin lesion.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is C: Further evaluation is required; measure free testosterone.

The patient's symptoms of fatigue, weight gain, interrupted sleep, and daytime somnolence, along with his low morning total testosterone level of 279 ng/dL, suggest hypogonadism or androgen deficiency. However, it's important to note that total testosterone levels can fluctuate throughout the day and can be affected by various factors such as age, obesity, and medications. Therefore, it's essential to measure free testosterone levels, which are less affected by these factors, to confirm the diagnosis of androgen deficiency.

Choice A, measuring gonadotropins, is not necessary at this point because the patient's symptoms and low total testosterone level suggest hypogonadism, and measuring gonadotropins would not help in confirming the diagnosis.

Choice B, repeating total testosterone measurement using an immunoassay, may not provide accurate results as the patient's total testosterone level is already low, and immunoassays can be affected by various factors such as interfering substances or heterophilic antibodies.

Choice D, stating that the patient has androgen deficiency and no further evaluation is required, is incorrect because, as mentioned earlier, it's essential to measure free testosterone levels to confirm the diagnosis of androgen deficiency.

Therefore, the best answer is C: Further evaluation is required; measure free testosterone.

**Answer**:C. Propylthiouracil-induced hypersensitivity vasculitis

Explanation:

C. Propylthiouracil-induced hypersensitivity vasculitis is the correct answer because it aligns with the patient's medical history, symptoms, and laboratory results.

Propylthiouracil, a medication used to treat hyperthyroidism, can cause a rare but potentially life-threatening side effect called hypersensitivity vasculitis. This condition is characterized by inflammation of the blood vessels, leading to the formation of purpura and ulcers on the skin, as well as kidney and lung damage.

The patient's history of hyperthyroidism and recent treatment with propylthiouracil increases the likelihood of this diagnosis. The presence of retiform purpura on the bilateral helices, which is a characteristic finding in hypersensitivity vasculitis, supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's positive test result for perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCAs) is consistent with this diagnosis, as p-ANCAs are commonly positive in patients with hypersensitivity vasculitis.

The other answer choices do not align as well with the patient's symptoms and laboratory results:

A. Levamisole-induced vasculopathy is a rare side effect of levamisole, a medication used to treat certain parasitic infections. While it can cause skin lesions, it is not typically associated with purpura or hypersensitivity vasculitis.

B. Mixed cryoglobulinemia is a condition characterized by the presence of abnormal proteins in the blood, which can cause blood clots and kidney damage. While it can present with skin lesions, it is not typically associated with hypersensitivity vasculitis.

D. Septic vasculitis is a serious condition that occurs when bacterial infections cause inflammation in the blood vessels. While it can cause skin lesions and kidney damage, it is not typically associated with a history of hyperthyroidism or positive p-ANCAs.

**Answer**: D. Polyarteritis nodosa

Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a systemic necrotizing vasculitis that affects small and medium-sized arteries. The patient's symptoms of episodic muscle cramping and numbness involving the lower extremities, as well as the appearance of stellate red-brown patches on the distal extremities, are consistent with PAN. The fact that the lesions began on the bilateral lower legs and spread to the thighs, buttocks, hands, forearms, and proximal arms also supports this diagnosis.

The histopathological findings of the incisional wedge biopsy, which showed a necrotizing vasculitis with fibrinoid deposition and inflammation, are also consistent with PAN. The absence of induration, scale, or ulceration on the lesions suggests that the vasculitis is not yet at the stage of tissue destruction, which is another feature of PAN.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis, is a systemic vasculitis that affects small and medium-sized arteries, similar to PAN. However, GPA typically presents with a triad of symptoms, including nasal ulcers, pulmonary infiltrates, and kidney involvement, which are not mentioned in this case. Additionally, the presence of granulomas, which are characteristic of GPA, was not mentioned in the histopathological findings.

Microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) is another systemic vasculitis that affects small blood vessels. However, MPA typically presents with fewer cutaneous manifestations than PAN and GPA, and the histopathological findings do not typically show the same degree of fibrinoid deposition as seen in PAN.

Leukocytoclastic vasculitis (LCV) is a cutaneous vasculitis that affects small blood vessels and is characterized by the presence of leukocytoclasia, or the destruction of white blood cells within the vessel walls. While LCV can cause cutaneous manifestations similar to those seen in PAN, such as red-brown patch

**Answer**: B. Apocrine poroma

The patient's history of a slowly enlarging lesion over a period of 5 years, with no personal or family history of malignancy, suggests a benign growth. The physical examination and dermoscopic findings also support this diagnosis.

The irregular pigment globules, milialike cysts, and focal arborizing vessels seen on dermoscopy are consistent with an apocrine poroma. Apocrine poromas are benign growths that arise from the apocrine glands, which are found in the skin and produce sweat. They are typically slow-growing and painless, and can appear as a variety of colors, including brown, pink, and yellow.

The other answer choices do not fit the patient's presentation. Basal cell carcinoma (choice A) is a type of skin cancer that typically appears as a flesh-colored or pink nodule, and is often associated with a history of sun exposure. While it can have a pigmented appearance, it does not typically have the milialike cysts and arborizing vessels seen in apocrine poromas.

Congenital nevus (choice C) is a type of birthmark that is present at birth or appears within the first few years of life. It is typically a flat, brown or black spot, and does not have the same type of pigment globules or cysts seen in apocrine poromas.

Seborrheic keratosis (choice D) is a benign growth that appears as a rough, scaly patch or plaque. It can be brown, black, or gray in color, but does not have the same type of pigment globules or cysts seen in apocrine poromas.

Therefore, based on the patient's history, physical examination, and dermoscopic findings, the most likely diagnosis is apocrine poroma.

**Answer**:C. Progressive supranuclear palsy

The patient's symptoms of gait dysfunction, balance issues, personality changes, and judgment impairment over a 4-year period, along with the absence of a family history of Alzheimer's disease, are more consistent with a diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) than Alzheimer's disease. Additionally, the patient's abnormal posturing, left toe pointing upward, and falls, as well as the presence of frontotemporal hypometabolism on PET imaging, are also consistent with PSP.

Alzheimer's disease, frontal variant (choice A), typically presents with more prominent memory impairment and less prominent personality changes compared to PSP. Frontotemporal dementia (choice B) can present with personality changes and language impairment, but the presence of gait dysfunction and abnormal posturing is less common. Corticobasal degeneration (choice D) typically presents with a mix of cognitive and motor symptoms, but the presence of frontotemporal hypometabolism on PET imaging is less common.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and diagnostic findings, the most likely diagnosis is progressive supranuclear palsy (choice C).

The correct answer is D. Observation.

The patient in this case has a history of choroidal melanoma that was treated with iodine 125 plaque brachytherapy, which resulted in a significant decrease in tumor height and stable visual acuity. The patient now presents with a new pigmented lesion on the sclera that corresponds to the site of the previous tumor and plaque placement.

Option A, repeat iodine 125 plaque brachytherapy, is not the best choice because the tumor has already been treated and there is no evidence of recurrence. Repeating the treatment could potentially cause unnecessary side effects and may not be effective in removing the pigmented lesion.

Option B, external beam radiotherapy, is also not the best choice because it would involve directing high-energy radiation at the tumor site, which could potentially damage surrounding tissue and may not be necessary given the stable tumor size and lack of evidence of recurrence.

Option C, enucleation, is not appropriate because it involves surgically removing the eye, which would be an extreme measure given the stable tumor size and lack of evidence of recurrence.

Therefore, the best option is D, Observation, which involves closely monitoring the patient's condition and performing regular follow-up examinations to assess any changes in the pigmented lesion or potential recurrence of the tumor. This approach allows for timely intervention if necessary while avoiding unnecessary treatments or procedures.

**Answer**:A. Discontinue treatment with chloroquine.

The correct answer is A, "Discontinue treatment with chloroquine," because the patient has been diagnosed with advanced chloroquine retinopathy, which is a known side effect of long-term use of chloroquine. The patient's symptoms of bilateral, painless, progressive visual diminution, along with the physical examination findings of bilateral posterior subcapsular cataracts, hypopigmented zones in the parafoveal macula, and red-green deficiencies, are all consistent with chloroquine retinopathy.

Discontinuing chloroquine treatment is the appropriate next step in management, as it may slow or halt the progression of retinopathy. The risk of continued chloroquine use outweighs the benefit, given the patient's established nephropathy and advanced retinopathy.

In contrast, option B, "Reassure and observe," is not appropriate as the patient's symptoms and examination findings indicate advanced retinopathy, which requires prompt intervention. Option C, "Treat with intravitreous corticosteroids," may be considered in some cases of chloroquine retinopathy, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's management. Option D, "Examine family members for macular dystrophy," is not relevant to the patient's current condition and management.

The correct answer is C, Circumscribed juvenile pityriasis rubra pilaris (PRP), for the following reasons:

* Follicular rash on the knees and elbows: PRP typically presents with follicular, pink, scaly papules that coalesce into plaques on the extensor surfaces of the knees, elbows, and wrists. This is consistent with the patient's symptoms.
* Hyperkeratotic palms: PRP often causes marked orange-red hyperkeratosis and hyperlinearity of the palms, as seen in the patient's case.
* No other medical problems or recent travel: PRP is a rare genetic disorder that affects the skin, causing the symptoms described above. It is not associated with other medical problems or triggered by recent travel.
* No pets: PRP is not caused by an allergic reaction to pets or any other environmental factors.
* Vaccinations up to date: PRP is not caused by a reaction to vaccinations.

The other answer choices do not fit the patient's symptoms and medical history:

* A. Psoriasis: Psoriasis can cause similar skin lesions, but it is usually more widespread and not limited to the extensor surfaces. The patient's history of a sudden onset of symptoms and the absence of any other medical conditions suggest that psoriasis is less likely.
* B. Ichthyosis: Ichthyosis is a group of disorders characterized by dry, scaly skin. While it can cause hyperkeratosis, it does not typically cause follicular rashes or plaques on the extensor surfaces.
* D. Atopic dermatitis: Atopic dermatitis, also known as eczema, can cause itchy, scaly patches on the skin. However, it typically affects the flexural surfaces, such as the neck, wrists, and ankles, rather than the extensor surfaces.

The mass in the left periorbital region with osseous destruction and erosion into the zygoma, infratemporal fossa, inferolateral orbit, and maxillary sinus, as shown in the CT images, is consistent with rhabdomyosarcoma. The patient's age and lack of other symptoms, such as fever, chills, or weight loss, also support this diagnosis.

Metastatic neuroblastoma (choice A) is unlikely given the patient's age and the absence of other symptoms, such as fever, chills, or weight loss. Neuroblastoma typically affects children under the age of 5 and presents with symptoms related to the primary tumor in the abdomen or chest.

Lymphoma (choice C) is also unlikely given the patient's age and the absence of other symptoms, such as fever, chills, or weight loss. Lymphoma typically affects older children and presents with symptoms related to the primary tumor in the neck, underarm, or groin.

**Answer**: B. Chondrodermatitis nodularis chronica helicis

Chondrodermatitis nodularis chronica helicis (CNCH) is a rare condition characterized by the development of painful nodules on the ears, particularly on the helix. The nodules are typically small, firm, and dome-shaped, with central crusting. The patient's history of wearing a cap that created pressure and friction on the upper part of both ears suggests that the nodules may have been caused by chronic irritation and inflammation.

The histopathologic features of the nodule, as shown in Figure B, are also consistent with CNCH. The sharply defined, centrally depressed ulcer covered by a hyperkeratotic parakeratotic scale, occasional bacterial colonies, and plasma, as well as the eosinophilic degeneration of collagen and solar elastosis in the base of the ulcer, are all characteristic features of CNCH. The presence of proliferating blood vessels and a mild lymphomononuclear infiltrate also support this diagnosis.

In contrast, the other answer choices do not fit the patient's symptoms and histopathologic findings as well.

A. Keratoacanthoma is a benign tumor that usually occurs on sun-exposed areas of the skin, particularly on the hands and arms. It is characterized by a rapid growth of a small, firm nodule with a central crust. While the nodules in this case are firm and have central crusting, they are not rapidly growing and are not located on sun-exposed areas.

C. Glomus tumor is a rare benign tumor that originates from the glomus cells of the skin. It typically presents as a small, painful nodule on the fingers or toes. While the nodules in this case are painful, they are not located on the fingers or toes, and the histopathologic features do not support a diagnosis of glomus tumor.

A. Osteolipoma is the correct diagnosis because it is a benign tumor that originates from the mesenchymal tissue of the soft tissues, specifically the periodontal membrane. It is characterized by a slow-growing, painless mass that is usually located in the mandibular region, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms. The fact that the mass is nontender, firm, and mobile relative to the underlying mandible, and that there are no overlying skin or mucosal changes, also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the CT imaging findings of a well-defined, hyperdense, mildly heterogeneous mass with few focal areas of fat attenuation along the inferior aspect of the lesion, and the absence of periosteal reaction or erosion into the underlying bone, are consistent with an osteolipoma.

B. Myositis ossificans is an incorrect diagnosis because it is a condition where there is bony formation within muscle tissue, usually due to trauma or inflammation. This is not consistent with the patient's symptoms or imaging findings, as there is no evidence of bony formation within the mass.

C. Liposarcoma is an incorrect diagnosis because it is a malignant tumor that arises from fat cells, usually in the deep soft tissue of the extremities. It is characterized by a rapidly growing mass that is usually painful, and can infiltrate surrounding tissues. This is not consistent with the patient's symptoms of a slow-growing, painless mass that is mobile relative to the underlying mandible, and the absence of any evidence of infiltration of surrounding tissues on imaging.

The patient's history of recent loss of several close relatives and the presence of enhancing nodular foci located within deep white matter structures, the basal ganglia, the caudate, the pons, and the midbrain, as well as enhancement of the interpeduncular cistern and cerebral peduncles, are all consistent with a diagnosis of primary central nervous system lymphoma.

A. Inflammatory demyelinating processes such as multiple sclerosis are not likely because the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a mass effect, and the MRI findings do not show the characteristic features of demyelination.

B. Neoplasms such as multicentric glioma, glioblastoma multiforme, and metastases are possible, but the patient's history and MRI findings are more consistent with a diagnosis of primary central nervous system lymphoma.

C. Infectious causes including tuberculosis, neurosyphilis, and toxoplasmosis are unlikely because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with these conditions, and there is no evidence of infection on the MRI.

Therefore, D. Primary central nervous system lymphoma is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and MRI findings.

**Answer**: D. Spinal extradural arachnoid cyst

The patient's symptoms of episodic numbness and paresthesias in both feet, with symptom-free intervals between episodes, and the fact that the symptoms progressed in frequency and duration, are consistent with a spinal extradural arachnoid cyst. The cyst can compress the spinal cord and nerve roots, causing symptoms that worsen with activity and improve with lying down. The patient's history of urinary retention and the need for intermittent self-catheterization also support this diagnosis, as bladder dysfunction is a common complication of spinal extradural arachnoid cysts.

The MRI scan with FIESTA sequences revealed a blurry spinal cord signal alteration at the T7-T8 level with deformation of the cord posteriorly, which is consistent with a spinal extradural arachnoid cyst. The dynamic computed tomographic myelogram demonstrated a lesion compressing the dorsal spinal cord at the T7 level, further supporting the diagnosis.

 choice A, anterior thoracolumbar spinal cord herniation, is an unlikely diagnosis as it typically presents with sudden onset of severe back pain, bilateral sciatica, and bladder and bowel dysfunction. The patient's symptoms of episodic numbness and paresthesias do not fit with this diagnosis.

 choice B, malignant neoplasm of the spinal cord, is unlikely as the patient's symptoms do not suggest a malignant process, and there is no evidence of cancer on the MRI or CT scans.

 choice C, spinal dural arteriovenous fistula, is also unlikely as it typically presents with pulsatile tinnitus, headache, and ocular symptoms, and there is no evidence of an arteriovenous shunt on the imaging studies.

Therefore, D. Spinal extradural arachnoid cyst is the most likely diagnosis for the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.

**Answer**: B. Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis

The patient's symptoms of acute onset of abdominal pain, localized to the right upper quadrant, and tender abdomen are consistent with acute cholecystitis. However, the absence of fever, chills, and leukocytosis, as well as the normal complete blood cell count and liver function tests, make acute cholecystitis less likely.

The patient's history of recurrent abdominal pain over the past month, which worsened over time, suggests a chronic process rather than an acute one. Additionally, the absence of any other symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or changes in bowel habits, makes it less likely that the patient has gallstones or acute cholecystitis.

The patient's age and the presence of a soft-tissue mass associated with the fundus of the gallbladder, as seen on the computed tomographic scan, are consistent with a diagnosis of xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis. This is a rare condition that typically affects older adults and is characterized by the presence of granulomas in the gallbladder wall.

Gallbladder cancer is a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's age and the absence of any other symptoms or risk factors. Adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder is a rare condition that typically presents with symptoms of biliary colic and is characterized by the presence of multiple small nodules in the gallbladder. It is also less likely given the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis.

The correct answer is C: D-dimer test result is positive but below the patient's age-adjusted cutoff. PE is ruled out.

Let's go through each answer choice and explain why it's incorrect or correct:

A: D-dimer test result is positive. Imaging test is required.

This answer choice is incorrect because the D-dimer test result is positive, but the patient's age-adjusted cutoff is not met. Therefore, an imaging test is not required, and PE is not confirmed.

B: D-dimer test result is positive. The diagnosis of PE is confirmed.

This answer choice is incorrect because the D-dimer test result is positive, but the patient's age-adjusted cutoff is not met. Therefore, the diagnosis of PE cannot be confirmed, and further testing is needed.

D: D-dimer test result is positive due to active malignancy. PE is ruled out.

This answer choice is incorrect because there is no mention of active malignancy in the patient's history. Therefore, this possibility cannot be considered, and the D-dimer test result should be interpreted based on the patient's clinical presentation and other laboratory results.

Now, let's discuss why C is the correct answer:

C: D-dimer test result is positive but below the patient's age-adjusted cutoff. PE is ruled out.

This answer choice is correct because the D-dimer test result is positive, but the patient's age-adjusted cutoff is not met. Therefore, the likelihood of PE is low, and further testing, such as an imaging study, is not required. The patient's symptoms and clinical presentation should be re-evaluated, and alternative diagnoses should be considered.

In summary, the correct answer is C: D-dimer test result is positive but below the patient's age-adjusted cutoff. PE is ruled out. The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not take into account the patient's age-adjusted cutoff, active malignancy, or the need for further testing.

**Answer**:C. Order immobilization with non–weight-bearing activity

The correct answer is C. Order immobilization with non–weight-bearing activity, because it is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's symptoms.

The patient presents with localized pain in the mid shin, which is consistent with a stress injury or fracture. The single-leg hop test elicited severe localized pain, which suggests a possible stress fracture. Immobilization with non–weight-bearing activity would help to reduce the stress on the affected area and allow for healing.

Option A, Obtain laboratory work to assess for nutritional or hormonal abnormalities, may be appropriate in some cases, but it is not the most urgent step in this patient's management. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a musculoskeletal issue, rather than a nutritional or hormonal disorder.

Option B, Refer for immediate surgery, is not appropriate at this time. While surgery may be necessary in some cases of stress fractures, it is not the initial step in management. Immobilization and pain management are usually tried first, and surgery is considered if these measures fail.

Option D, Order observation and pain management with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), is incorrect because while NSAIDs can help with pain management, they do not address the underlying cause of the pain. Immobilization is necessary to reduce the stress on the affected area and allow for healing.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Order immobilization with non–weight-bearing activity.

**Answer**:C. Obtain antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) titers

The patient's presentation of a painful rash and swelling of his right foot, in the context of a history of bronchiectasis, raises the possibility of a vasculitic process. The presence of eosinophilia and the recent worsening of respiratory symptoms further support this possibility.

Option C, obtaining antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) titers, is the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation. ANCA is a marker of vasculitis, and elevated titers can confirm the diagnosis. This information will guide further management and help determine the appropriate treatment.

Option A, obtaining blood cultures and empirically treating with intravenous vancomycin, may be appropriate if there were signs of sepsis or bacteremia, but there is no indication of this in the patient's presentation.

Option B, performing a herpes simplex virus/varicella zoster virus direct fluorescent antibody test and empirically treating with valacyclovir, may be appropriate if there were signs of herpes simplex or zoster infection, but there is no mention of this in the patient's history or physical examination.

Option D, starting a high-potency topical steroid, may be appropriate for some skin conditions, but it is not the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation and management.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Obtain antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) titers.

**Answer**: D. Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma

The correct answer is D. Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma because it aligns with the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

A. Sarcoidosis is an inflammatory disease that can cause skin lesions, but it typically presents with scaling and crusting, which is not seen in this patient. The patient's skin lesions are also not characteristic of sarcoidosis.

B. Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection that can cause skin lesions, but it typically presents with a primary chancre, which is not seen in this patient. The patient's skin lesions are also not characteristic of syphilis.

C. Indeterminate cell histiocytosis is a rare condition that can cause skin lesions, but it typically presents with a solitary lesion, which is not seen in this patient. The patient's skin lesions are also not characteristic of indeterminate cell histiocytosis.

D. Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma is a malignancy that can cause skin lesions, fever, weakness, and malaise, which are all present in this patient. The patient's skin lesions are also consistent with this diagnosis. The peripheral blood smear shows abnormal lymphocytes, which supports this diagnosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma.

**Answer**:C. Paraneoplastic pemphigus

The patient's symptoms, including a blistering erythematous eruption and painful oral lesions, are consistent with paraneoplastic pemphigus. This is a rare autoimmune disease that is associated with certain types of cancer, including lymphoma. The patient's history of non-Hodgkin follicular lymphoma increases the likelihood of this diagnosis.

The patient's skin biopsy showed suprabasal acantholysis and a dermal infiltrate of lymphocytes, histiocytes, and scattered eosinophils, which is consistent with paraneoplastic pemphigus. Additionally, the positive indirect immunofluorescence test of rat urinary bladder epithelium supports this diagnosis.

Bullous pemphigoid, choice A, is an autoimmune disease that causes blisters and sores on the skin and mucous membranes. However, it is less likely in this case because the patient does not have a history of skin fragility or chronic blistering, and the biopsy results do not show the characteristic separation of the epidermis from the dermis.

Stevens-Johnson syndrome, choice B, is a severe allergic reaction that can cause blisters and sores on the skin and mucous membranes. However, it is less likely in this case because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with an allergic reaction, and there is no evidence of a recent medication or infection that could have triggered the reaction.

Pemphigus vulgaris, choice D, is an autoimmune disease that causes blisters and sores on the skin and mucous membranes. However, it is less likely in this case because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with the typical presentation of pemphigus vulgaris, and the biopsy results do not show the characteristic separation of the epidermis from the dermis.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, medical history, and biopsy results, the most likely diagnosis is paraneoplastic pemphigus.

**Answer**:B. Tumid lupus erythematosus

The correct answer is B. Tumid lupus erythematosus because it matches the patient's history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and the clinical presentation of tender erythematous nodules after undergoing right knee arthroscopy.

A. Cellulitis is an infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissues, which may cause tender erythematous nodules. However, the patient's history of SLE and the absence of any signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, or warmth, make cellulitis an unlikely diagnosis.

C. Gyrate erythema is a rare cutaneous manifestation of SLE, characterized by erythematous, circular or oval, and slightly elevated lesions. While the patient's lesions are erythematous and poorly demarcated, they do not have the characteristic circular or oval shape of gyrate erythema.

D. Erythema nodosum is a common cutaneous manifestation of SLE, characterized by the rapid development of tender, erythematous, and slightly elevated nodules on the shins or other areas of the body. However, the patient's lesions are not located on the shins and do not have the characteristic rapid onset of erythema nodosum.

Therefore, based on the patient's history of SLE and the clinical presentation of tender erythematous nodules after undergoing right knee arthroscopy, the most likely diagnosis is tumid lupus erythematosus.

**Answer**: B. Computed tomographic scan of the orbit

The patient presents with a large, hemorrhagic, necrotic mass obscuring the entire globe and eyelids of the left eye. The rapid growth of the mass and its effect on vision suggest a potentially aggressive and invasive process. The patient's history of enucleation of the right eye secondary to a traumatic ruptured globe increases the likelihood of a primary orbital tumor.

A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the orbit is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient. CT scans provide high-resolution images of the orbit and can help to identify the nature and extent of the mass. Specifically, a CT scan can help to differentiate between a benign and malignant process, assess the degree of orbital invasion, and identify any potential intracranial extension.

Exenteration (choice A) is not the most appropriate next step, as it is a surgical procedure that involves the removal of the eye and adjacent tissues. While exenteration may ultimately be necessary, it should only be considered after a thorough diagnostic evaluation, including imaging and biopsy, has been completed.

Enucleation (choice C) is also not the most appropriate next step, as it is a surgical procedure that involves the removal of the eye. Like exenteration, enucleation should only be considered after a thorough diagnostic evaluation has been completed.

Testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (choice D) is not relevant to the patient's current condition and is not the most appropriate next step. While HIV can affect the eye and orbit, it is not typically associated with a rapidly growing, hemorrhagic, necrotic mass.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is a CT scan of the orbit to further evaluate the nature and extent of the mass and guide subsequent management.

**Answer**:B. Consider a diagnosis of choroidal metastasis

The correct answer is B, "Consider a diagnosis of choroidal metastasis," because the patient's symptoms and test results suggest the possibility of a metastatic tumor in the choroid. The patient's history of breast carcinoma with positive lymph nodes and the absence of any other conditions that could cause similar symptoms, such as Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome or syphilitic chorioretinitis, support this diagnosis. The presence of a serous macular detachment with turbid subretinal fluid, as well as the absence of retinal pigment epithelium leakage, a smokestack pattern of subretinal leakage, or RPE gutter defects on fluorescein angiography, are also consistent with choroidal metastasis.

Option A, "Consider managing as multifocal central serous chorioretinopathy," is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and test results do not support this diagnosis. While central serous chorioretinopathy can cause similar symptoms, it is typically associated with a history of systemic corticosteroid use, which the patient did not have.

Option C, "Obtain workup for Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome," is also incorrect because the patient's symptoms and test results do not support this diagnosis. Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome is a rare condition that can cause similar symptoms, but it is typically associated with a history of systemic corticosteroid use and certain other findings on ophthalmoscopy and fluorescein angiography that are not present in this case.

Option D, "Blood tests to consider diagnosis of syphilitic chorioretinitis," is incorrect because there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has syphilis or syphilitic chorioretinitis.

**Answer**: D. Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD)

Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is a viral illness that is common in children under the age of 10. It is caused by the coxsackievirus and can cause a range of symptoms including fever, mouth sores, and a rash with blisters on the hands and feet. One of the distinctive features of HFMD is the presence of nail changes, which can include brittle nails, cracks, and sloughing of the nails.

In the case described, the 7-year-old girl presented with a 4-week history of progressive nail changes, including brittle nails with cracks and painless sloughing of nails. Both fingernails and toenails were affected, which is consistent with HFMD. The fact that the family was concerned and suspected an internal disease or vitamin deficiency also suggests that the child's symptoms were not typical of a common nail condition.

The other answer choices do not fit the symptoms described in the case.

A. Drug intake: There is no mention of the child taking any medications that could cause nail changes.

B. Kawasaki syndrome: Kawasaki syndrome is a rare autoimmune disease that can cause fever, rash, and swollen lymph nodes. It is not typically associated with nail changes.

C. Vaccination reaction: There is no mention of the child having recently received a vaccination, and nail changes are not a common side effect of vaccinations.

Therefore, based on the symptoms described, the most likely diagnosis is Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD).

**Answer**: B. Sinonasal teratocarcinosarcoma

The correct answer is B. Sinonasal teratocarcinosarcoma because it best matches the given clinical presentation and histopathological findings.

A. Olfactory neuroblastoma is an uncommon tumor that arises from the olfactory epithelium. It typically presents with unilateral nasal obstruction, bleeding, and/or anterior skull base defects. The patient's symptoms of worsening, primarily left-sided sinus obstruction and congestion with associated hyposmia, facial pressure, and headaches do not fit well with this diagnosis. Additionally, the presence of a friable, polypoid mass in the ethmoid sinus with extension into the nasal cavity and superiorly to the skull base, as well as the histopathological findings of a heterogeneous tumor with small, angulated, blue cells with hyperchromatic nuclei, apoptosis, and mitosis, malignant glands lined by cuboidal cells with round nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and eosinophilic cytoplasm, do not support this diagnosis.

C. Small cell carcinoma is a highly aggressive malignancy that typically affects the lung and less frequently the head and neck region. It often presents with symptoms such as cough, chest pain, and hemoptysis, and less frequently with nasal symptoms. The patient's symptoms and the histopathological findings do not support this diagnosis.

D. Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma is a rare malignancy that typically affects the soft tissues of the head and neck, and less frequently the sinonasal cavity. It often presents with symptoms such as painless masses or swelling in the neck, and less frequently with nasal symptoms. The presence of rhabdomyoblasts in the tumor, as indicated by the positive staining for desmin and myogenin, supports this diagnosis, but it is not the most likely diagnosis given the patient's symptoms and the histopathological findings of a heterogeneous tumor with malignant glands and luminal

The presence of respiratory epithelium with submucosal vascular proliferation and no atypia among the lining endothelial cells, as well as the numerous capillaries and central vessel surrounded by lobules of endothelial-lined capillaries, are all consistent with a diagnosis of lobular capillary hemangioma.

A. Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma is an incorrect choice because it is a benign tumor that typically affects young males and is characterized by a prominent fibromuscular stroma and a rich blood supply, which is not consistent with the histopathologic findings described in the case.

C. Inverting papilloma is an incorrect choice because it is a type of benign tumor that arises from the nasal cavity and is characterized by a distinctive "inverted" growth pattern, where the tumor grows inwardly into the surrounding tissue, which is not consistent with the description of the polypoid nasal mass occupying the left nasal roof and completely obstructing the nasal passage.

D. Respiratory epithelial adenomatoid hamartoma is an incorrect choice because it is a rare benign tumor that typically affects the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses, and is characterized by a mixture of respiratory epithelium and mesenchymal elements, which is not consistent with the histopathologic findings described in the case.

The correct answer is C. Osteochondroma.

An osteochondroma is a benign bony tumor that projects from the surface of a bone. It is typically covered with normal mucosa and can cause symptoms such as oropharyngeal discomfort, snoring, and obstructive sleep disturbance, as seen in the patient's history. The tumor is firm, nontender, and firmly adherent to the surrounding tissue, which is consistent with the physical examination findings described in the case.

The patient's symptoms of gradually increasing lumpy feeling on swallowing for at least 6 months, without dysphagia, dyspnea, or pain, are also consistent with an osteochondroma. The tumor's location on the posterior oropharyngeal wall and its size (4 × 3 cm) are also consistent with an osteochondroma.

The CT scan showing a segmented bony lesion located at the odontoid process and the body of the C2 vertebra, and the MRI showing a mass with high signal intensity with a hypointense rim in both T1- and T2-weighted images, are also consistent with an osteochondroma.

The polysomnography results showing an apnea-hypopnea index of 58.7/h and a minimal oxygen saturation of 76%, which led to a diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea, are also consistent with an osteochondroma causing obstruction in the oropharynx.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, imaging results, and polysomnography results, the most likely diagnosis is an osteochondroma causing obstructive sleep apnea.

The other answer choices are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and findings:

**Answer**: B. Pleomorphic adenoma

Pleomorphic adenoma, also known as a mixed tumor, is a type of benign tumor that can occur in various parts of the body, including the soft palate. It is characterized by a mixture of epithelial and mesenchymal components, and can have a variety of histological features, including glandular, squamous, and chondroid differentiation.

In this case, the patient presented with a gradually enlarging soft palate mass, which was firm and nontender, and had no overlying ulceration or discoloration. These features are consistent with a pleomorphic adenoma, which tends to grow slowly and often presents as a painless, submucosal mass. The fact that the lesion was easily dissected from the surrounding tissue and that the overlying mucosa was spared also supports this diagnosis.

Mucoepidermoid carcinoma, option A, is a type of malignant tumor that can occur in the soft palate, but it typically presents with more aggressive features, such as pain, difficulty swallowing, and cervical lymphadenopathy. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest a malignant tumor.

Hemangioma, option C, is a benign vascular tumor that can occur in various parts of the body, including the soft palate. However, hemangiomas typically have a characteristic appearance on imaging studies, with a well-defined, rounded or oval shape, and a "salt and pepper" appearance due to the presence of numerous small vessels. The imaging findings in this case do not support a diagnosis of hemangioma.

Granular cell tumor, option D, is a rare type of benign tumor that can occur in various parts of the body, including the soft palate. However, it typically presents as a painless, slowly growing mass, and the imaging findings do not support a diagnosis of granular cell tumor.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and imaging studies, the most likely diagnosis is pleomorphic adenoma.

**Answer**: B. Extramammary Paget disease

The patient's history of a persistent, scaly rash in the inguinal crease, with a history of lichen simplex chronicus and failure of topical steroid treatment, suggests a diagnosis of extramammary Paget disease (EMPD). EMPD is a rare condition that affects the apocrine glands in the skin, particularly in the inguinal and axillary regions. The patient's age and history of previous cancer diagnoses (prostate cancer and melanoma) also increase the likelihood of this diagnosis.

The other options are less likely based on the patient's history and physical examination findings:

A. Fungal infection: While fungal infections can cause scaly, itchy rashes, they typically do not have the same persistent and refractory course as EMPD. Additionally, fungal infections are not typically associated with a history of lichen simplex chronicus.

C. Bowen disease: Bowen disease, also known as squamous cell carcinoma in situ, is a type of skin cancer that can cause scaly, crusted plaques. However, it typically affects sun-exposed areas and is less likely to occur in the inguinal crease.

D. Lichen sclerosis: Lichen sclerosis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that can cause thinning and scarring of the skin, as well as itching and pain. However, it typically affects the genital area and is less likely to cause a multifocal, scaly plaque in the inguinal crease.

Therefore, based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is extramammary Paget disease.

**Answer**: C. Polycystic liver disease

The patient's symptoms of worsening chronic malaise, fatigue, dyspnea, early satiety, and abdominal distention with extreme discomfort, along with the abdominal magnetic resonance image (MRI) shown in Figure 1A, are consistent with a large mass occupying most of the upper abdomen. The intraoperative photograph of the giant multinodular mass shown in Figure 1B supports this diagnosis.

Polycystic liver disease (PCLD) is a rare condition characterized by the development of multiple cysts in the liver. It is often associated with polycystic kidney disease (PKD), which the patient had previously been diagnosed with. The patient's history of PKD and the presence of a large abdominal mass are both consistent with PCLD.

De novo kidney graft tumor (Option A) is unlikely given the patient's history of PKD and the presence of a multinodular mass. Recurrence of polycystic kidney disease (Option B) is also unlikely given that the patient had previously undergone renal transplantation for PKD. Caroli disease (Option D) is a rare condition characterized by dilated intrahepatic bile ducts and is not associated with PKD.

**Answer**: D. Echinococcal disease

The correct answer is D. Echinococcal disease because the patient's history of living in an area where Echinococcus granulosus is endemic, combined with the presence of a large splenic cyst with calcified capsule and debris within the cyst, are all consistent with echinococcal disease. Echinococcus granulosus is a parasite that can cause hydatid disease, which is characterized by the formation of cysts in various organs, including the spleen. The patient's history of eating sheep meat, which is not organ meat, and running in areas with dog feces on the ground, increases the likelihood of exposure to Echinococcus granulosus eggs or larvae. The negative result of the serologic test for Echinococcus antibody IgG does not rule out the diagnosis, as the test may not always be positive in early stages of the infection.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Congenital cyst: This is unlikely because the patient's age and medical history do not suggest a congenital condition.

B. Splenic abscess: The patient's symptoms and imaging findings do not suggest an abscess. An abscess would typically cause symptoms such as fever, chills, and abdominal pain, and would appear as a fluid collection with an irregular border on imaging.

C. Cystic metastasis to the spleen: This is unlikely because there is no evidence of a primary tumor or metastatic disease in other parts of the body.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Echinococcal disease.

The correct answer is B: The patient has euvolemic hypotonic hyponatremia.

Euvolemic hypotonic hyponatremia means that the patient has a low sodium level in their blood, but their body has a normal amount of fluid. This is in contrast to hypovolemic hypotonic hyponatremia, where the patient has a low sodium level and a low amount of fluid in their body.

In this case, the patient's urine output, specific gravity, and electrolyte levels suggest that they have euvolemic hypotonic hyponatremia. The patient's urine output is high, which indicates that their body is producing excess urine, and their specific gravity is low, which means that their urine is dilute. Additionally, the patient's electrolyte levels, such as potassium and chloride, are normal, which suggests that their body is not losing excess electrolytes.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A: Hypovolemic hypotonic hyponatremia would indicate that the patient has a low sodium level and a low amount of fluid in their body, which is not supported by the patient's urine output, specific gravity, and electrolyte levels.

C: Hypervolemic hypertonic hyponatremia would indicate that the patient has a low sodium level and an excess amount of fluid in their body, which is also not supported by the patient's urine output, specific gravity, and electrolyte levels.

D: Hypervolemic hypotonic hyponatremia would indicate that the patient has a low sodium level and an excess amount of fluid in their body, but their urine output and specific gravity suggest that they have euvolemic hypotonic hyponatremia instead.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: The patient has euvolemic hypotonic hyponatremia.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is C. Perform skin biopsy and direct immunofluorescence.

A skin biopsy is necessary to establish the diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis, which is a chronic autoimmune blistering disorder. Direct immunofluorescence is a technique that can help to confirm the diagnosis by identifying the presence of IgA deposits in the skin. This is particularly useful in cases where the diagnosis is uncertain or there are atypical features.

Option A, examining for infestation with scabies, is not the next step in management. Although scabies infestation can cause a diffuse vesicular rash, it is unlikely in this case given the patient's history of chronic diarrhea, renal insufficiency, hypothyroidism, and aortic stenosis. Additionally, the patient has already been treated with oral antibiotics and corticosteroids, which would likely have addressed any scabies infestation.

Option B, obtaining a complete blood cell count and creatinine level, may be appropriate at some point in the patient's management, but it is not the most pressing concern given the patient's symptoms and history. The patient's chronic diarrhea and renal insufficiency suggest that there may be underlying kidney disease, but this can be evaluated with blood tests and other diagnostic studies at a later time.

Option D, obtaining a chest radiograph, is not relevant to the patient's skin symptoms or medical history. While the patient's age and history of aortic stenosis may suggest a need for monitoring of cardiovascular disease, this is not the most pressing concern in this scenario.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to perform a skin biopsy and direct immunofluorescence to establish the diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis and guide further treatment.

**Answer**: D. The patient has severe aortic valve stenosis with preserved left ventricular systolic function.

The correct answer is D, "The patient has severe aortic valve stenosis with preserved left ventricular systolic function," because the patient's symptoms and test results suggest this diagnosis.

The patient's history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and stage 3 renal insufficiency increases the likelihood of valvular heart disease. The physical examination findings of a 3/6 harsh, late-peaking systolic murmur that radiates to the carotids with a soft A2, 2/4 diastolic decrescendo murmur at the left lower sternal border, and 2/6 holosystolic murmur at the apex suggest the presence of mitral regurgitation and aortic stenosis. The 2-D and Doppler transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) results support this diagnosis, showing severe aortic valve stenosis with preserved left ventricular systolic function.

Option A, "The patient has functional mitral regurgitation secondary to a dilated cardiomyopathy," is incorrect because although the patient does have mitral regurgitation, it is not caused by a dilated cardiomyopathy. Instead, it is likely caused by aortic stenosis.

Option B, "The patient has obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy," is also incorrect because there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has this condition. The patient's symptoms and test results are more consistent with aortic stenosis.

Option C, "The patient has moderate aortic valve stenosis with the severity overestimated by Doppler measurements," is incorrect because the patient's aortic valve stenosis is severe, not moderate, and the Doppler measurements do not overestimate the severity of the stenosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is D, "The patient has severe aortic valve stenosis with preserved left ventricular systolic function."

**Answer**: B

The correct answer is B, Perform lumbar puncture with patient in upright position to measure opening pressure and examine cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) components.

Papilledema, or swelling of the optic disc, is a common complication of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). CVST occurs when a blood clot forms in the venous sinuses of the brain, which can cause increased pressure in the brain and lead to symptoms such as headache, seizures, and vision loss. Papilledema is a result of the increased pressure in the brain, which can cause the optic disc to swell.

In this case, the patient presented with blurry vision in his right eye and rhythmic pulsing sounds in both ears, which are consistent with CVST. The patient's history of well-controlled hypertension and poor vision in the left eye for many years also supports the diagnosis of CVST.

Performing a lumbar puncture with the patient in an upright position is the most appropriate next step in diagnosing and managing CVST. This procedure allows for the measurement of the opening pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the examination of the CSF components. The opening pressure is typically elevated in CVST, and the CSF may show evidence of blood in the form of red blood cells or hemoglobin.

The other answer choices are not as appropriate for the following reasons:

A. Perform skeletal survey: While a skeletal survey may be necessary to rule out other causes of papilledema, such as multiple myeloma or lymphoma, it is not the most appropriate next step in this case given the patient's history and physical examination findings.

C. Order magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or magnetic resonance venography (MRV) of the brain and orbits: While MRI or MRV may be useful in evaluating the extent of CVST, it is not the most appropriate next step in diagnosing and managing CVST. MRI or MRV should be considered after the diagnosis has been confirmed by lumbar puncture.

**Answer**: B. Fibrosis and ulceration caused by meperidine

The correct answer is B, fibrosis and ulceration caused by meperidine, because the patient's history of self-administering subcutaneous injections of meperidine, a opioid medication, for the past 3 years, at different sites, including the deltoid areas and abdomen, is the most likely cause of the fibrosis and ulceration observed in the patient's skin. The patient's history of mechanical low back pain and long-standing mental depression, as well as the use of other medications, may also be relevant to the patient's overall health and potential treatment plan, but they are not directly related to the development of the fibrosis and ulceration.

Pyoderma gangrenosum, option A, is an uncommon skin condition characterized by the rapid development of painful, necrotic ulcers, often associated with systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, and malaise. While the patient's ulcer on the dorsum of his right forearm shares some similarities with pyoderma gangrenosum, the absence of systemic symptoms and the patient's history of meperidine use suggest that fibrosis and ulceration caused by meperidine is a more likely diagnosis.

Localized scleroderma (morphea), option C, is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by thickening and hardening of the skin, often with a violet-colored discoloration. While the patient's woody induration of skin on both forearms and on the abdominal region may resemble the skin changes seen in localized scleroderma, the patient's history of meperidine use and the presence of ulceration argue against this diagnosis.

Mycobacterium haemophilum infection, option D, is a rare infection caused by a slow-growing, acid-fast bacterium. While the patient's history of self-administering subcutaneous injections may suggest a risk of infection, the negative culture results and absence of signs of joint inflammation argue against this diagnosis

**Answer**: B. Condyloma lata

The correct answer is B. Condyloma lata because it matches the symptoms and characteristics described in the question.

Condyloma lata, also known as condylomata acuminata, is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. It is characterized by the growth of small, painless warts or lesions on the genitals, anus, or mouth. The lesions are usually soft and moist, and may be flat or raised.

In this case, the patient presented with a slowly enlarging, painful mass on his buttock, which is not a typical location for condyloma acuminata. However, the presence of an erythematous rash on the forearms and thighs, along with the marked epidermal hyperplasia and dense dermal infiltrate containing lymphocytes and plasma cells, are consistent with the diagnosis of condyloma lata.

The other answer choices do not match the symptoms and characteristics described in the question:

A. Condyloma acuminata: This is a different type of STI caused by the same bacterium, Treponema pallidum. It is characterized by the growth of small, painless warts or lesions on the genitals, anus, or mouth. The lesions are usually soft and moist, and may be flat or raised. However, condyloma acuminata typically does not cause painful masses on the buttock.

C. Verrucous herpes simplex virus: This is a viral infection that causes a painful, crusted ulcer on the skin. It is not associated with the growth of small, soft warts or lesions on the genitals, anus, or mouth.

D. Granuloma inguinale: This is a chronic bacterial infection caused by Klebsiella granulomatis.

**Answer**: B. Primary oral histoplasmosis

The correct answer is B, Primary oral histoplasmosis, because the patient's symptoms and the results of the biopsy suggest this diagnosis.

Histoplasmosis is a fungal infection caused by Histoplasma capsulatum. It is commonly found in soil and bird droppings, and can be inhaled or ingested. In this case, the patient's ulcer on the tongue suggests a primary oral infection.

The biopsy results show a mixed cell infiltrate and intracellular yeast forms within histiocytes, which are consistent with histoplasmosis. The absence of underlying induration, friability, or bleeding on manipulation also supports this diagnosis, as these are not typically seen in squamous cell carcinoma or tubercular chancre.

Squamous cell carcinoma (choice A) is a type of skin cancer that can occur in the mouth, but it typically presents with a persistent, non-healing ulcer or nodule, and is more common in older adults. The patient's age and the absence of a history of tobacco or alcohol use make this diagnosis less likely.

Mucosal leishmaniasis (choice C) is a parasitic infection that can cause ulcers in the mouth, but it is typically associated with a history of travel to an endemic area and exposure to sandflies. The patient's lack of travel history and the absence of other symptoms make this diagnosis less likely.

Tubercular chancre (choice D) is a type of skin lesion caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but it typically presents with a painless, non-healing ulcer or nodule, and is more common in people with a history of tuberculosis or HIV infection. The patient's lack of history of tuberculosis or HIV infection and the absence of other symptoms make this diagnosis less likely.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and the biopsy results, the most likely diagnosis is primary oral histoplasmosis.

**Answer**: D. Cut-and-push-through technique

The correct answer is D. Cut-and-push-through technique because it allows for the removal of the fishhook in a controlled manner while minimizing the risk of further damage to the eye.

The back-out technique (A) involves removing the fishhook in a retrograde manner through its entry wound. This technique carries the risk of the hook slipping and causing further damage to the eye, especially if the hook is deeply embedded.

The advance-and-cut technique (B) involves rotating the hook anterogradely, clipping the barb, and back out the hook retrogradely through the entry wound. This technique requires more manipulation of the hook and carries a higher risk of damage to the eye.

The needle-cover technique (C) involves using the bevel of a large bore needle through the entry wound to engage and “cover” the barb, then withdraw together. This technique may not provide adequate control over the removal of the hook and may cause further damage to the eye.

The cut-and-push-through technique (D) involves cutting the lure, making a corneal exit wound next to the distal end of the hook, and rotating the hook through the exit wound. This technique allows for the removal of the hook in a controlled manner, minimizing the risk of further damage to the eye. It also allows for the removal of the entire hook, including the barb, which reduces the risk of leaving any foreign body behind.

Therefore, D. Cut-and-push-through technique is the best answer.

The correct answer is C: Intravenous vitamin therapy.

The patient's symptoms of decreased vision, confusion, and ataxia, along with the physical examination findings of mild abduction deficit, prominent upbeating nystagmus, and disc edema with peripapillary nerve fiber layer thickening and intraretinal hemorrhages, suggest a potential vitamin deficiency. The patient's history of gastric bypass surgery and subsequent weight loss may have led to a deficiency in vitamins and minerals, particularly vitamin B12, which is commonly deficient in patients who have undergone bariatric surgery.

Intravenous vitamin therapy would be an appropriate next step in the patient's management, as it would provide a rapid and effective way to replenish vitamin stores and potentially improve the patient's symptoms.

The other answer choices are not as appropriate for the following reasons:

A: Lumbar puncture: While a lumbar puncture may be necessary to evaluate for other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a central nervous system infection or inflammatory condition, it is not the most appropriate next step in this case given the patient's history and physical examination findings.

B: Magnetic resonance imaging and/or venography: These tests may be useful in evaluating the patient's symptoms, particularly if there is a concern for a structural lesion or vascular abnormality, but they are not as urgently needed as intravenous vitamin therapy.

D: Intravenous corticosteroids: Corticosteroids may be considered in the management of certain neurological conditions, but they are not the most appropriate choice in this case given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, which suggest a vitamin deficiency rather than an inflammatory condition.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: Intravenous vitamin therapy.

**Answer**: C. Esophageal perforation

The patient's symptoms of choking with feeds and a large volume of clear oral secretions that required frequent suctioning suggest a possibility of an esophageal perforation. This is supported by the patient's history of difficulty breathing and apnea, which may indicate that the patient has inhaled food or liquids into their lungs. The patient's age and prematurity also increase the likelihood of an esophageal perforation.

Option A, gastroesophageal reflux, is unlikely given the patient's age and symptoms. While gastroesophageal reflux can cause regurgitation and choking, it is less likely to cause a large volume of clear oral secretions.

Option B, tracheoesophageal fistula, is also unlikely given the patient's symptoms. A tracheoesophageal fistula is a connection between the trachea and esophagus, which can cause food and liquids to enter the trachea and lungs. However, this would not explain the patient's choking symptoms or the large volume of clear oral secretions.

Option D, aspiration, is a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's age and symptoms. Aspiration occurs when food or liquids enter the lungs, which can cause respiratory symptoms. However, the patient's symptoms of choking and clear oral secretions suggest a more proximal problem, such as an esophageal perforation.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and history, option C, esophageal perforation, is the most likely diagnosis.

**Answer: C. Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis (XGC)**

Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis (XGC) is a rare and benign inflammatory condition that affects the gallbladder. It is characterized by the formation of granulomas, which are clusters of immune cells that accumulate in response to chronic inflammation. The condition typically affects middle-aged to elderly individuals, and the symptoms can mimic those of gallbladder cancer.

In this case, the patient presented with abdominal pain, weight loss, and depression, which are all common symptoms of XGC. The patient's history of cardiac arrhythmia, hypertension, and sigmoidectomy for diverticulitis also increases the likelihood of XGC. The patient's lab results, including an elevated C-reaction protein level, also support the diagnosis of XGC.

The patient's ultrasonography and abdominal computed tomography scan results revealed a thickened gallbladder wall infiltrating the liver parenchyma, which is consistent with XGC. Additionally, the patient's magnetic resonance imaging showed a greatly enlarged gallbladder with a thickened wall without invading adjacent structures, a continuous mucosal line, and a hypoattenuated intramural nodule, which are all characteristic features of XGC.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, medical history, and imaging results, the most likely diagnosis is Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis (XGC).

**Answer: A. Carcinoma of the gallbladder**

Carcinoma of the gallbladder is a malignant tumor that arises from the epithelial cells lining the gallbladder. It is a relatively rare cancer, but it is an important consideration in patients with a history of gallbladder disease.

**Answer**: D. Ovarian cyst with torsion.

The correct answer is D. Ovarian cyst with torsion because it best fits the patient's symptoms and radiographic findings.

A. Cecal duplication is an unlikely diagnosis because the patient's abdominal radiograph shows dilated small-bowel loops, which is not consistent with the expected findings of a cecal duplication. Additionally, the presence of ganglion cells on suction rectal biopsy suggests that the distal portion of the bowel is intact, making cecal duplication less likely.

B. Small-bowel volvulus is also an unlikely diagnosis because the patient's abdominal radiograph shows a soft but distended abdomen, which is not consistent with the expected findings of a small-bowel volvulus. Furthermore, the presence of retained contrast in the terminal ileum 6 days after the initial radiography suggests that the bowel is not obstructed, which makes small-bowel volvulus less likely.

C. Infantile leiomyosarcoma is a rare tumor that can occur in the gastrointestinal tract, but it is not a likely diagnosis in this case. The patient's symptoms and radiographic findings are not consistent with the expected presentation of infantile leiomyosarcoma.

D. Ovarian cyst with torsion is the most likely diagnosis because it can cause abdominal distension, vomiting, and fever, which are consistent with the patient's symptoms. The presence of unilateral labial swelling also suggests a possible ovarian origin. The radiographic findings of dilated small-bowel loops and retained contrast in the terminal ileum are consistent with an intestinal obstruction caused by the ovarian cyst.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Ovarian cyst with torsion.

**Answer**:B. The patient has lactic acidosis from lymphoma.

The correct answer is B, "The patient has lactic acidosis from lymphoma," because lactic acidosis can be a complication of cancer, particularly lymphoma. The patient's history of advanced, refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma involving the abdomen and the presence of a large mesenteric mass abutting multiple segments of the small intestine and encasing the mesenteric vasculature suggest that the lactic acidosis is likely due to tumor invasion or compression of the small intestine, which can lead to impaired gut perfusion and hypoxia.

Choice A, "The patient has lactic acidosis from hypovolemic shock," is incorrect because the patient's vital signs, including his blood pressure and tachycardia, do not suggest hypovolemic shock. Although the patient received 3 L of intravenous normal saline in the first 24 hours, this suggests that the patient was not hypovolemic.

Choice C, "The patient has lactic acidosis from mesenteric ischemia," is also incorrect because the patient's abdominal examination results remained unchanged from the initial presentation, suggesting that there was no significant change in the patient's intestinal perfusion. Additionally, the patient's tachycardia improved after fluid resuscitation, which suggests that the patient's hypovolemia was not severe enough to cause mesenteric ischemia.

Choice D, "The patient has lactic acidosis from sepsis," is unlikely because the patient did not have signs of sepsis, such as fever, tachypnea, or leukocytosis. Additionally, the patient's lactic acidosis did not resolve with fluid resuscitation, which suggests that the underlying cause is not likely due to sepsis.

**Answer**: D. Observe and provide supplemental oxygen

Explanation:
The patient presented with increasing dyspnea and chest wall tenderness after a choking incident, with a history of successful dislodgment of a piece of ham using the Heimlich maneuver. On arrival, she was dyspneic and in respiratory distress, with an oxygen saturation of 80% that improved to 99% with supplemental oxygen. Given the patient's history and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Option A, starting intravenous antibiotics, intravenous fluid resuscitation, and obtaining serum lactate level and blood and sputum cultures, may be appropriate for a patient with sepsis or pneumonia, but it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient's presentation. The patient's symptoms and examination findings are not consistent with sepsis or pneumonia, and there is no evidence of infection in the chest radiograph or computed tomographic scan.

Option B, starting oxygen, β2-agonist nebulizer treatments, steroids, and oral azithromycin, may provide some symptomatic relief for the patient's dyspnea, but it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's respiratory distress. The patient's history of choking and the physical examination findings suggest that the patient's respiratory distress is likely due to ARDS, which requires more comprehensive management.

Option C, starting aspirin, β-blocker, and considering cardiac catheterization, is not appropriate for this patient's presentation. The patient's history and physical examination findings do not suggest a cardiac etiology for her symptoms, and starting aspirin and β-blocker therapy without further evaluation may be harmful.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to observe and provide supplemental oxygen, as choice D suggests. This will help to alleviate the patient's respiratory distress and allow for further evaluation and management of the underlying cause of her symptoms,

HIV infection increases the risk of developing Kaposi's sarcoma, and it is important to rule out HIV infection in patients presenting with suspicious skin lesions.

Option A, initiating empirical treatment with a topical steroid, is not appropriate as it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and may not be effective in treating Kaposi's sarcoma.

Option B, initiating photodynamic therapy, is also not appropriate as it is not a suitable treatment for Kaposi's sarcoma.

Option C, ordering computed tomography imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, may be necessary to rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, but it is not the most appropriate next step in the patient's management.

**Answer**: C. Hyperbilirubinemia due to Gilbert syndrome

Gilbert syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the liver's ability to process bilirubin, leading to mild hyperbilirubinemia. The patient's history of asymptomatic elevated bilirubin levels, without any other signs of liver disease, suggests that this may be the underlying cause. Additionally, the patient's age and lack of family history of liver disease make it less likely that other causes of hyperbilirubinemia, such as cholelithiasis or hemolysis, are present.

A. Hyperbilirubinemia due to cholelithiasis: Cholelithiasis, or gallstones, can cause hyperbilirubinemia by blocking the flow of bile from the liver into the small intestine, leading to a buildup of bilirubin in the blood. However, the patient's lack of symptoms and normal liver function tests make it less likely that cholelithiasis is the cause of his hyperbilirubinemia.

B. Hyperbilirubinemia due to Dubin-Johnson syndrome: Dubin-Johnson syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the liver's ability to transport bilirubin into the bile. This can lead to mild hyperbilirubinemia, similar to Gilbert syndrome. However, Dubin-Johnson syndrome typically presents with more severe hyperbilirubinemia and jaundice, which is not present in this patient.

D. Hyperbilirubinemia due to hemolysis: Hemolysis, or the breakdown of red blood cells, can cause hyperbilirubinemia by releasing bilirubin into the blood. However, the patient's lack of symptoms and normal liver function tests make it less likely that hemolysis is the cause of his hyperbilirubinemia. Additionally, the patient's history of asymptomatic elevated bilirubin levels over 30 years suggests a chronic, rather than acute, cause.

The correct answer is B. Syringomatous adenoma of the nipple because it best matches the patient's symptoms and the results of the mammography and biopsy.

A. Tubular carcinoma is a type of breast cancer that originates in the milk ducts. While it can present with a subareolar mass, it typically does not have the same calcification patterns as seen in this case. The mammography image shows a large grouping of subareolar calcifications extending into the skin and nipple, which is more consistent with a benign process such as syringomatous adenoma.

C. Low-grade adenosquamous carcinoma is a type of breast cancer that can have a similar appearance to syringomatous adenoma, but it typically has a more irregular and asymmetric shape. Additionally, low-grade adenosquamous carcinoma tends to have a more prominent nuclear pleomorphism and increased mitotic activity, which is not seen in the biopsy specimen.

D. Florid papillomatosis of the nipple is a rare condition characterized by numerous small papillomas on the nipple-areola complex. While it can present with a subareolar mass, it typically does not have the same calcification patterns as seen in this case. Additionally, the biopsy specimen does not show the characteristic features of florid papillomatosis, such as numerous small papillary projections.

**Answer**: D. Peeling skin disease

The correct diagnosis for the 2-year-old girl with skin fragility is D. Peeling skin disease.

Peeling skin disease, also known as acral peeling skin syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by painless, spontaneous peeling of the skin, mainly on the palms and soles. The disease typically presents in infancy or early childhood, and the peeling can be triggered by minor trauma, heat, or moisture. The clinical features of peeling skin disease include mild xerosis, superficial skin erosions, and erythematous residual macules from previous erosions, which are consistent with the patient's symptoms.

The patient's history of symptoms improving in winter and worsening in summer, along with the absence of blistering, also supports the diagnosis of peeling skin disease. Additionally, the patient's normal hair, nails, and mucous membranes, as well as the lack of any significant findings on skin biopsy, rule out other potential diagnoses.

In contrast, Kindler syndrome (choice A) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by skin fragility, blistering, and scarring. It typically presents at birth or in early infancy and is associated with mutations in the KIND1 gene. While skin fragility is a shared feature between Kindler syndrome and peeling skin disease, the absence of blistering and scarring in the patient suggests that Kindler syndrome is less likely.

Dermatitis artefacta (choice B) is a psychocutaneous disorder characterized by self-induced skin damage, often as a result of unconscious or conscious manipulation of the skin. While the patient's history of peeling off skin with marked facility may suggest a psychocutaneous disorder, the absence of any psychological or behavioral symptoms and the presence of skin fragility and erosions argue against this diagnosis.

Burkitt lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the immune system, specifically B cells. It is a relatively rare type of cancer, but it can affect various parts of the body, including the breast.

The patient's symptoms of enlargement and induration of both breasts, as well as the skin biopsy specimen shown in Figure B, are consistent with Burkitt lymphoma of the breast. The patient's age and the fact that she is lactating also increase the likelihood of this diagnosis, as Burkitt lymphoma is more common in older adults and can occur during pregnancy or lactation.

The patient's laboratory results also support this diagnosis. A low hemoglobin level and low platelet count are common in patients with Burkitt lymphoma, as the cancer can cause bone marrow failure.

The other answer choices are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia of the breast (choice A) is a rare type of cancer that affects the breast tissue.

The patient's retinal findings, including the well-demarcated hypopigmented lesion originating from the retinal nerve fiber layer and protruding into the vitreous cavity, are consistent with retinal astrocytic hamartoma. This condition is a type of benign tumor that occurs in the retina and can be associated with other systemic findings. The patient's skin hypopigmentation and family history of no dermatologic or genetic diseases suggest that the retinal astrocytic hamartoma may be part of a syndrome.

The correct answer, B. Brain imaging and echocardiography, is chosen because it is appropriate to investigate the possibility of a syndrome associated with the retinal astrocytic hamartoma. Brain imaging, such as MRI or CT scan, can help identify any intracranial abnormalities that may be associated with the retinal findings, while echocardiography can help evaluate for any cardiac abnormalities that may be part of a syndrome.

In contrast, A. Renal ultrasonography and lumbar puncture, may be appropriate for some neurocutaneous syndromes, but it is not directly related to the patient's retinal findings. C. Metastatic workup, is not indicated as there is no evidence of malignancy in the patient's history or physical examination. D. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy of ocular lesion, may be considered in some cases, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's evaluation, as the diagnosis of retinal astrocytic hamartoma is already suspected based on the patient's retinal findings.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is B: Check antinuclear antibody (ANA) level.

The patient's symptoms of recurrent subconjunctival hemorrhages and retinal vascular abnormalities, along with the physical examination findings of bilateral vitreous cells, optic disc hyperemia, arterial attenuation, arterial and venous sheathing, hard exudates, and focal areas of retinal thinning, suggest a possible diagnosis of ocular inflammatory disease.

The presence of hyperlipidemia and arthritis in the patient's medical history increases the likelihood of an underlying autoimmune disorder, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, which can cause ocular inflammation.

Checking the antinuclear antibody (ANA) level can help support the diagnosis of an autoimmune disorder, as a positive ANA result is commonly seen in patients with autoimmune diseases, including lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.

On the other hand, checking blood pressure (choice A) may not provide significant information in this case, as hypertension is not typically associated with ocular inflammatory disease.

Checking hemoglobin A1c level (choice C) may be relevant for diagnosing and managing diabetes, but it is not directly related to the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

Checking erythrocyte sedimentation rate (choice D) may be useful in diagnosing and monitoring certain inflammatory conditions, but it is not specific to autoimmune disorders and may not provide conclusive information in this case.

Therefore, the best next step would be to check the antinuclear antibody (ANA) level to help support the diagnosis of an autoimmune disorder and guide further management.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain why B. Kerion celsi is the correct answer and why the other choices are incorrect.

**Answer**: B. Kerion celsi

Kerion celsi, also known as ringworm of the scalp, is a fungal infection caused by the dermatophyte Microsporum canis. The patient's symptoms of a tender, red nodule on the scalp with a boggy consistency, thick yellow crust, and suppurative discharge are consistent with a kerion. The loss of hair within the affected area and the presence of annular scaly patches on the patient's upper back are also typical of kerion celsi.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Mycobacterial infection: Mycobacterial infections can cause skin lesions, but they are typically not tender or boggy in consistency. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are not consistent with a mycobacterial infection.

C. Dissecting cellulitis: Dissecting cellulitis is a bacterial infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. It can cause tender, red nodules, but the patient's symptoms of a boggy consistency and suppurative discharge are not typical of dissecting cellulitis.

D. Abscess: An abscess is a collection of pus that can result from a bacterial infection. The patient's symptoms of a tender, red nodule with suppurative discharge could be consistent with an abscess, but the presence of annular scaly patches and the loss of hair within the affected area are not typical of an abscess.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is kerion celsi.

**Answer**:B. Malignant transformation of an enterogenous cyst

The correct answer is B, Malignant transformation of an enterogenous cyst, for the following reasons:

A. Lymphoma: Lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the immune system, specifically affecting the lymph nodes and other lymphoid tissues. While it is possible for lymphoma to occur in the retroperitoneum, the imaging findings in this case do not suggest lymphoma as the primary diagnosis. The presence of a large, exophytic mass with solid and cystic components involving the left kidney, posterior abdominal wall, and mesocolon is not typical of lymphoma.

C. Retroperitoneal sarcoma: Retroperitoneal sarcoma is a rare type of cancer that originates in the retroperitoneum. However, the imaging findings in this case do not suggest retroperitoneal sarcoma as the primary diagnosis. The presence of a cystic component within the mass suggests a different diagnosis.

D. Primary neoplasm arising from the kidney: While it is possible for a primary neoplasm to arise from the kidney, the imaging findings in this case do not suggest this as the primary diagnosis. The involvement of the posterior abdominal wall and mesocolon suggests a different origin for the mass.

B. Malignant transformation of an enterogenous cyst: An enterogenous cyst is a type of congenital cyst that originates from the remains of the embryonic gut. Malignant transformation of an enterogenous cyst is a rare occurrence, but it can happen. The imaging findings in this case, including the presence of a large, exophytic mass with solid and cystic components involving the left kidney, posterior abdominal wall, and mesocolon, are consistent with malignant transformation of an enterogenous cyst. The patient's age and lack of other symptoms also support this diagnosis. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.

**Answer**:B. Stent perforation.

The patient's symptoms of 2 days of crampy abdominal pain and obstipation, as well as the physical examination findings of hepatomegaly and left lower abdominal tenderness, suggest a possible bowel obstruction. The patient's history of fecaluria and pneumaturia for 2 months supports this diagnosis. The patient's carcinoembryonic antigen level of 23.8 ng/mL is elevated, which is consistent with a diagnosis of colon cancer. The computed tomography scan reveals a 9-cm, obstructed sigmoid colon mass with fistulous extensions to the bladder and small bowel, and numerous metastases to the liver, peritoneum, and omentum. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of colon cancer with metastasis. The patient was referred to a gastroenterologist for stent placement, which was performed endoscopically.

The night after the procedure, the patient developed generalized peritonitis, and a computed tomography scan revealed abundant free air. This suggests that there was a perforation of the colon, which is a complication of colonoscopic stent placement. The patient's symptoms and imaging findings are consistent with a diagnosis of stent perforation.

Choice A, colon cancer perforation, is incorrect because while the patient does have a diagnosis of colon cancer, the perforation is not a result of the cancer itself, but rather a complication of the stent placement procedure.

Choice C, acute mesenteric ischemia, is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and imaging findings do not support this diagnosis. Acute mesenteric ischemia is a condition where the blood supply to the intestines is suddenly blocked, leading to abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The patient's symptoms of crampy abdominal pain and obstipation, as well as the physical examination findings of hepatomegaly and left lower abdominal tenderness, do not suggest acute mesenteric ischemia.

**Answer**: D

Crusted scabies, also known as Norwegian scabies, is a severe form of scabies that is often seen in immunocompromised individuals, such as those with HIV/AIDS. The patient's history of mild psoriasis that worsened significantly 1 year prior to presentation, leading to a diagnosis of HIV infection, suggests that the patient may have been immunocompromised for some time. The patient's symptoms, such as intense pruritus, diffuse crust and scale, and hyperkeratotic areas, are consistent with crusted scabies. The patient's recent diagnosis of AIDS and low CD4 cell count further support this diagnosis.

Prescribing a topical corticosteroid (option A) may help reduce inflammation and itching, but it will not treat the underlying scabies infection. Ordering syphilis serology (option B) is not necessary, as the patient's symptoms and history do not suggest syphilis. Prescribing a topical antifungal (option C) may be appropriate if there is a secondary fungal infection, but it will not treat the scabies infection. Performing a skin scraping with microscopy (option D) is the appropriate diagnostic test to confirm the diagnosis of crusted scabies.

**Answer**:B. The patient likely has sepsis, possibly with an uncontrolled infectious source, that requires further workup.

The patient's presentation of fever, cough, anorexia, malaise, tachycardia, hypotension, respiratory distress, and oliguria, along with an elevated lactate level, is consistent with sepsis. The patient's history of cirrhosis and liver dysfunction increases the likelihood of sepsis. The patient's lactate level decreased after fluid resuscitation, but it increased again despite further resuscitation and the addition of vasopressors, indicating that the patient is not adequately perfused and may have ongoing sepsis.

Option A is incorrect because while epinephrine-induced β2-adrenergic stimulation can increase lactate production, it is not the primary cause of the patient's hyperlactatemia in this scenario.

Option C is incorrect because while liver dysfunction can decrease lactate clearance, it is not the primary cause of the patient's hyperlactatemia in this scenario. The patient's lactate level increased despite fluid resuscitation, which suggests that the patient's liver dysfunction is not the primary cause of the hyperlactatemia.

Option D is incorrect because while the patient is hypoperfused and requires further fluid and pressor resuscitation, this is not the primary cause of the patient's hyperlactatemia in this scenario. The patient's lactate level increased despite fluid resuscitation, indicating that the patient's hypoperfusion is not the primary cause of the hyperlactatemia.

**Answer**:A. Obtain a lipid panel

The correct answer is A. Obtain a lipid panel because the patient's symptoms and history suggest a possible diagnosis of erythema multiforme, which is a skin condition that can be associated with elevated lipid levels. The patient's history of pancreatitis, recent repair of a tibial fracture, and family history of type 2 diabetes also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's current medications, such as phenobarbital and gabapentin, can cause lipid abnormalities. Therefore, it is appropriate to obtain a lipid panel to help confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment.

The other answer choices are not as appropriate for the following reasons:

B. Order a chest radiograph: While a chest radiograph may be necessary to evaluate for other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, such as pneumonia or lung cancer, it is not directly related to the patient's skin symptoms or potential diagnosis of erythema multiforme.

C. Treat empirically with oral prednisone: While oral prednisone may be a reasonable treatment option for erythema multiforme, it is not the most appropriate next step in the patient's management. Before initiating treatment, it is important to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms.

D. Unroof one of the papules and send for viral culture: This option is not appropriate because there is no indication of a viral infection in the patient's history or physical examination findings. Additionally, unroofing a papule may not provide a sufficient sample for viral culture, and it may not be necessary to perform a biopsy given the patient's symptoms and medical history.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is C: The audiogram reveals a right-sided SNHL and impaired speech discrimination, which necessitate further investigation.

Let's go through each answer choice and explain why it's incorrect or correct:

A: This audiogram depicts sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) consistent with early Meniere disease.

This choice is incorrect because while the audiogram does show a right-sided SNHL, it doesn't necessarily indicate early Meniere disease. Meniere disease is a disorder of the inner ear that can cause vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss, and a feeling of fullness in the affected ear. The symptoms described in the case, such as right-sided aural fullness and occasional right-sided headache, are consistent with Meniere disease, but the audiogram doesn't provide enough information to confirm the diagnosis. Further investigation is needed to determine the underlying cause of the hearing loss.

B: This audiogram depicts age-related hearing loss (presbycusis).

This choice is incorrect because the patient is only 35 years old, which is not considered elderly. Presbycusis is a gradual loss of hearing that occurs as people age, typically affecting high-frequency hearing. The audiogram doesn't show the typical pattern of presbycusis, which would include a gradual decline in hearing thresholds with increasing frequency.

D: This audiogram depicts a right-sided conductive hearing loss (CHL) with a notch at 2000 Hz, consistent with otosclerosis.

This choice is incorrect because the audiogram doesn't show a notch at 2000 Hz, which is a characteristic of otosclerosis. Otosclerosis is a condition that affects the middle ear and can cause conductive hearing loss. The audiogram shows a right-sided SNHL, which could be caused by a variety of factors, including otosclerosis, but the notch at 2000 Hz is not present.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: The audiogram reveals a right-sided SNHL and impaired speech discrimination, which necessitate

**Answer**: B. Pancreatic panniculitis

The correct answer is B. Pancreatic panniculitis because it matches the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

Pancreatic panniculitis is a rare condition characterized by inflammation of the subcutaneous fat, typically caused by pancreatic enzymes leaking into the abdominal cavity. The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, weight loss, and fatigue are consistent with a pancreatic disorder. The tender red lesions on the patient's bilateral ankles and legs, which appeared 2 days prior to admission, are also consistent with pancreatic panniculitis.

The patient's history of negative findings from a review of systems, such as cough, sore throat, history of hepatitis, tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, inflammatory bowel disease, or sulfonamide use, also supports the diagnosis of pancreatic panniculitis.

The punch biopsy performed on the patient demonstrated pathognomonic histopathologic findings, which further supports the diagnosis of pancreatic panniculitis.

Now, let's discuss why the other answer choices are incorrect:

A. Erythema nodosum: Erythema nodosum is a condition characterized by the development of tender, red, and painful nodules on the shins and legs. While the patient's symptoms of tender red lesions on the bilateral ankles and legs may seem similar to erythema nodosum, the absence of overlying ulceration, necrosis, or drainage and the patient's history of pancreatic symptoms make pancreatic panniculitis a more likely diagnosis.

C. Infectious panniculitis: Infectious panniculitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the subcutaneous fat due to an infection. While the patient's symptoms of fever and weight loss may suggest an infection, the absence of any signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, or purul

**Answer**: C. Cutaneous cholesterol embolism

The correct answer is C. Cutaneous cholesterol embolism because it matches the clinical presentation and histopathological findings described in the case.

Cutaneous cholesterol embolism is a rare condition that occurs when cholesterol crystals form in the blood vessels and cause a localized inflammatory response in the skin. This can result in the formation of a purpuric patch, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

The histopathological findings also support this diagnosis. Biopsy specimen 1 (Figure, B) shows needle-shaped clefts within the lumen of a blood vessel, which is consistent with cholesterol crystal emboli. Additionally, biopsy specimen 2 (Figure, C) shows eccrine ducts with cellular dyshesion and necrosis, which is also consistent with cutaneous cholesterol embolism.

In contrast, the other answer choices do not fit the clinical picture:

A. Warfarin necrosis: This is a rare side effect of warfarin therapy that occurs when there is a sudden decrease in the INR (international normalized ratio) and the patient develops widespread skin necrosis. The patient's history of peripheral arterial disease and remote history of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm suggest that he is at risk for bleeding complications, but there is no mention of warfarin use or a sudden decrease in INR.

B. Calciphylaxis: This is a rare condition that occurs when there is deposition of calcium in the skin and other tissues, leading to skin necrosis and ulceration. The patient's history of severe peripheral arterial disease and remote history of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm suggest that he is at risk for cardiovascular complications, but there is no mention of calcium deposition or skin necrosis.

**Answer**: C. Dyshidrosiform pemphigoid

The correct answer is C. Dyshidrosiform pemphigoid because it matches the clinical presentation and histopathological features described in the case.

Dyshidrosiform pemphigoid is a rare autoimmune blistering disorder that is characterized by the formation of tense bullae on the palms and soles. The bullae are typically large and painful, and can lead to difficulty with ambulation. The condition is often associated with other autoimmune disorders, such as diabetes mellitus and hypertension, which are also present in this patient.

The histopathological features of dyshidrosiform pemphigoid are characterized by a subepidermal blister with a "roof" of acantholytic cells, which are cells that have undergone apoptosis and have their cell membranes still intact. This is consistent with the hematoxylin-eosin staining of the biopsy specimen obtained from a bulla on the foot, which shows subepidermal blistering with a roof of acantholytic cells (Figure, B).

In contrast, the other answer choices do not match the clinical presentation or histopathological features of the case.

A. Bullous tinea pedis is a fungal infection that causes bullae on the feet, but it is typically accompanied by pruritus and spontaneous bleeding, which are not present in this case.

B. Allergic contact dermatitis is a skin reaction to an allergen, which can cause bullae, but it typically occurs on the exposed areas of the skin, such as the hands and face, and is not localized to the palms and soles.

D. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita is a rare autoimmune disorder that causes blistering and skin fragility, but it typically occurs on the trunk and extremities, and is not localized to the palms and soles.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation and histopathological features, the diagnosis is most likely dyshidrosiform pemphigoid.

**Answer**:D. Refer to otolaryngologist for nasal mass biopsy

The correct answer is D. Refer to otolaryngologist for nasal mass biopsy, as the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a possible diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis, a systemic vasculitis that can affect the eyes and respiratory system. The patient's history of sinusitis, worsening pain and redness of the right eye, nasal congestion, and raised, nonmobile, engorged perilimbal nodule in the inferotemporal sclera that was tender to palpation and did not blanch with phenylephrine drops, are all consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's elevated inflammatory markers, such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, also support this diagnosis.

The other answer choices are not appropriate for the following reasons:

A. Increase topical corticosteroid frequency: While topical corticosteroids may be used to treat inflammation associated with conjunctivitis, they are not appropriate for the treatment of a possible systemic vasculitis such as Wegener's granulomatosis.

B. Inject sub–Tenon capsule triamcinolone acetonide: Injecting sub–Tenon capsule triamcinolone acetonide may be used to treat inflammation associated with uveitis, but it is not appropriate for the treatment of a possible systemic vasculitis such as Wegener's granulomatosis.

C. Give oral prednisone: While oral prednisone may be used to treat inflammation associated with systemic vasculitis, it is not appropriate to start treatment without a definitive diagnosis. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a possible diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis, but a definitive diagnosis can only be made after a thorough evaluation, including a biopsy of the nasal mass.

Therefore, the best course of action is to refer the patient to an otolaryngologist for a nasal mass biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis and

The correct answer is B. Serum antibody titer.

The patient's symptoms of blurred vision, unilateral isolated disc edema, and development of macular edema with exudates suggest a possible diagnosis of optic neuritis. Optic neuritis is inflammation of the optic nerve that can be caused by various factors, including infection, autoimmune disorders, and demyelinating diseases.

A serum antibody titer would be appropriate to order next because it can help identify if the patient has an autoimmune disorder, such as multiple sclerosis, which is a common cause of optic neuritis. Elevated antibody levels in the blood can indicate an autoimmune response, which can help support the diagnosis.

Repeated neuroimaging (choice A) may not be necessary at this point, as the patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with optic neuritis, and the initial MRI scan did not show any masses or demyelinating lesions.

Cerebrospinal fluid analysis (choice C) may also not be necessary at this point, as the patient's symptoms are primarily ocular and do not suggest a central nervous system infection or inflammation.

Blood culture analysis (choice D) is not relevant to the patient's symptoms or possible diagnosis.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to order a serum antibody titer to help support the diagnosis of optic neuritis and guide further management.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain why C. Tinea capitis is the correct answer and why the other choices are incorrect.

**Answer**: C. Tinea capitis

Tinea capitis, also known as ringworm, is a fungal infection of the scalp that can affect people of all ages, including neonates. The clinical presentation of tinea capitis in neonates is characterized by the presence of annular plaques on the scalp, which are typically red and scaly, with a clear central area. The plaques may also have a fine scaling and several pinpoint pustules, as described in the case. The involvement of the eyebrows and mesolabial folds, as mentioned in the case, is also a common feature of tinea capitis in neonates.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

**A. Granuloma annulare**: Granuloma annulare is a chronic skin condition characterized by the formation of small, asymptomatic papules or nodules on the skin. While it can affect people of all ages, including neonates, it is not typically associated with annular plaques on the scalp. The plaques in granuloma annulare are usually smaller and more widespread, and may have a different appearance, with a more violaceous color and a greater tendency to ulcerate.

**B. Neonatal lupus erythematosus**: Neonatal lupus erythematosus is a rare autoimmune disease that affects newborns of mothers with systemic lupus erythematosus. It is characterized by a characteristic rash, which is typically flat, red, and painless, and may involve the face, scalp, and extremities. While the rash may have an annular configuration, it is not typically associated with the fine scaling and pustules described in the case. Moreover, the absence of a family history of autoimmune disease and the lack of symptoms in the mother suggest that neonatal lupus erythematosus is unlikely.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is B: Free-floating arterial thrombus.

A free-floating arterial thrombus is a blood clot that has formed in the artery but has not attached to the artery wall. It can cause a blockage in the blood vessel, leading to a lack of blood flow to the brain and potentially causing a stroke. The patient's symptoms of multiple transient ischemic attacks and the recent minor stroke with amaurosis fugax, slurred speech, right-sided weakness, and facial droop lasting longer than 24 hours are consistent with a free-floating arterial thrombus.

The sagittal view of the computed tomographic angiography of the head and neck (Figure 1) shows the distal extent of the findings (arrowhead) (B), which suggests a free-floating thrombus. The fact that the patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia also increases the likelihood of a thrombus formation.

Trapped air embolus (A) is not the correct answer because it refers to a condition where air enters the bloodstream and becomes trapped in a blood vessel, causing a blockage. While this can also cause stroke-like symptoms, it is not the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's history and imaging results.

Ruptured arterial plaque (C) is also not the correct answer. Ruptured arterial plaque occurs when a plaque in the artery wall ruptures, leading to bleeding into the artery. This can cause a blockage and lead to a stroke, but it is not the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's history and imaging results.

Radiographic artifact (D) is not the correct answer. Radiographic artifacts are errors in the imaging results that can occur due to various factors such as movement of the patient during the scan or technical issues with the imaging machine. While artifacts can sometimes mimic a thrombus, they are not the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's history and imaging results.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: Free-floating arterial thrombus.

The correct answer is D: The patient has primary hyperparathyroidism.

Let's go through each answer choice and explain why it's incorrect or correct:

A: Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) is a rare genetic disorder that causes hypercalcemia due to decreased calcium excretion in the urine. FHH is usually asymptomatic and diagnosed incidentally, like in this case. However, FHH is not associated with a history of thyroid cancer or thyroidectomy, which the patient has. Moreover, the patient's serum calcium levels were normal before thyroidectomy, making it less likely that she has FHH. Therefore, choice A is incorrect.

B: Hypercalcemia from thyroid suppression therapy is a possible diagnosis, as the patient is taking levothyroxine suppression therapy without evidence of recurrence. However, this therapy is typically used to treat thyroid cancer, and the patient's history of papillary thyroid cancer suggests that the hypercalcemia is more likely due to primary hyperparathyroidism. Additionally, the patient's serum calcium levels were normal before thyroidectomy, which suggests that the hypercalcemia is not due to thyroid suppression therapy alone. Therefore, choice B is incorrect.

C: Hypercalcemia of malignancy is a possibility, as some cancers, such as breast, lung, and kidney cancer, can produce parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTH-rp) that can cause hypercalcemia. However, there is no evidence of malignancy in the patient's history or physical examination. Moreover, the patient's serum calcium levels were normal before thyroidectomy, which makes it less likely that the hypercalcemia is due to malignancy. Therefore, choice C is incorrect.

D: Primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) is a rare endocrine disorder that causes hypercalcemia due to an overproduction of parathyroid hormone (PTH) from one or more parathyroid glands. The patient's history of thyroid cancer and thyroidectomy increases the likelihood of

**Answer**:B

Explanation:
Blastomycosis is a fungal infection caused by Blastomyces dermatitidis. It typically presents with skin lesions, pulmonary infiltrates, and bone pain. The patient's symptoms of a pustulonodular lesion on the nose, swelling and pain, and the presence of cavitary lesions in the lungs are consistent with Blastomycosis. The patient's history of injection drug use and working as a gardener also increases the likelihood of Blastomycosis.

A skin biopsy would not be the next step in management as it may not provide a definitive diagnosis and may delay treatment.

Intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics may be effective in treating secondary bacterial infections but would not treat the underlying fungal infection.

Topical metronidazole would not be effective in treating a systemic fungal infection such as Blastomycosis.

Topical steroids would not be effective in treating a fungal infection and may even worsen the condition by suppressing the immune system.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: Treat with intravenous antifungal medication.

**Answer**:B. Discontinue diclofenac

The correct answer is B, Discontinue diclofenac, because the patient's symptoms are consistent with an allergic reaction to the medication. The patient's history of a similar, though less severe, eruption following diclofenac ingestion four months earlier suggests that the medication is likely the cause of the current reaction. Discontinuing the medication will help prevent further exposure and potentially severe reactions.

Option A, Do nothing; the blisters will resolve over time, is not a suitable option as it does not address the underlying cause of the reaction and may allow the reaction to worsen.

Option C, Prescribe oral antihistamines and continue diclofenac, may provide some relief from the itching and burning sensations, but it will not address the root cause of the reaction, which is the medication. Continuing the medication may also increase the risk of further reactions.

Option D, Prescribe oral corticosteroids, may help reduce inflammation and itching, but it will not address the underlying cause of the reaction. Additionally, corticosteroids can have side effects, especially when used long-term, and may not be necessary in this case.

Therefore, the best course of action is to discontinue the medication and monitor the patient for any further complications.

**Answer**: C. Dermatitis herpetiformis

Dermatitis herpetiformis is a skin condition characterized by the formation of small, intensely pruritic papules or vesicles on the skin, often in a symmetrical distribution. In this case, the patient presented with a 3-month history of small reddish-brown spots affecting most of his fingers, which were persistent, asymptomatic, and without aggravating or alleviating factors. The patient had a history of type 1 diabetes mellitus and used standard finger sticks to test his blood glucose levels daily, which suggests that the lesions may be related to the patient's diabetes.

The histopathologic image shown in Figure B reveals subtle collections of neutrophils within the dermal papillae, which is consistent with the histopathologic features of dermatitis herpetiformis. Additionally, the direct immunofluorescence shown in Figure C reveals granular IgA deposition within the dermal papillae and at the dermoepidermal junction, which is a characteristic feature of dermatitis herpetiformis.

Now, let's discuss why the other answer choices are incorrect:

A. Janeway lesions: Janeway lesions are small, painless, red or purple spots that can occur on the palms and soles. They are usually associated with endocarditis, which is not mentioned in the patient's history.

B. Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura: Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a autoimmune disorder characterized by a low platelet count and a risk of bleeding. While petechiae and purpura are common symptoms of ITP, the patient's history of persistent, asymptomatic lesions and the absence of a bleeding disorder make ITP an unlikely diagnosis.

D. Petechiae due to pinprick testing: While the patient's history of using standard finger sticks to test his blood glucose levels daily may have contributed to the development of petechiae, it is unlikely that this

**Answer**: C. Amyloidosis

The patient's symptoms, such as dystrophic nails, doughy palms, redundant skin on each side of the gluteal cleft, easy bruising, and purpuric patches on the forehead, scalp, chest, and arms, are consistent with a diagnosis of amyloidosis. The presence of trachyonychia, or rough accentuated linear ridges, on the fingernails and thin, brittle toenails, as well as the diffuse nonscarring alopecia, are also consistent with this diagnosis.

The histopathologic specimen of the nail bed shows orange, amorphous, and extracellular material deposited in the subungual dermis of the nail bed, which is consistent with amyloidosis. The apple-green birefringence of the amorphous material in the subungual dermis under polarized light microscopy is also characteristic of amyloidosis.

Amyloidosis is a condition in which abnormal proteins accumulate in the body's tissues, leading to a variety of symptoms. The patient's symptoms, such as easy bruising and purpuric patches, are consistent with this condition.

In contrast, Lichen planus of the nails, cutaneous sarcoidosis, and alopecia areata do not explain the patient's symptoms or the histopathologic findings. Lichen planus is a condition that causes inflammation of the skin and nails, but it does not cause the accumulation of amorphous material in the subungual dermis. Cutaneous sarcoidosis is a condition that causes inflammation of the skin, but it does not cause the characteristic histopathologic findings of amyloidosis. Alopecia areata is a condition that causes hair loss, but it does not cause the other symptoms or histopathologic findings present in this case.

**Answer**:C. Fusarium and Mucormycosis

The correct answer is C. Fusarium and Mucormycosis. The patient's symptoms, such as the development of black plaques and white nodules on the burn wound, are consistent with a fungal infection. Fusarium and Mucormycosis are both types of fungi that can cause opportunistic infections in immunocompromised individuals, such as burn patients. The patient's history of recent burns and the presence of black plaques and white nodules on the wound are consistent with a diagnosis of Fusarium and Mucormycosis infection.

A. Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas are bacteria that can cause infections in burn patients, but they do not cause the characteristic black plaques and white nodules seen in Fusarium and Mucormycosis infections.

B. Candida and Aspergillus are types of fungi that can cause opportunistic infections, but they do not typically cause black plaques and white nodules on burn wounds.

D. Cryptococcus and Penicillium are types of fungi that can cause opportunistic infections, but they are less commonly associated with burn wound infections than Fusarium and Mucormycosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Fusarium and Mucormycosis.

**Answer**:B. Orbital imaging (magnetic resonance imaging)

The correct answer is B, Orbital imaging (magnetic resonance imaging), because it is essential to determine the extent and nature of the lesion before deciding on the appropriate treatment. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a possible orbital tumor, and MRI is the imaging modality of choice for evaluating orbital tumors. It provides excellent soft tissue resolution and can help differentiate between various types of tumors, such as benign vs. malignant, and lacrimal gland vs. orbital tumors.

Option A, Treat with prednisolone acetate, 1%, ophthalmic solution 4 times per day, is not the best next step, as it is a treatment for inflammatory conditions, and there is no clear indication of inflammation in the patient's presentation. Moreover, steroids may mask the symptoms and make it difficult to assess the response to treatment.

Option C, Reassure and observe, is not appropriate, as the patient has a rapidly growing mass on the caruncle, which may indicate a potentially aggressive lesion. It is essential to further evaluate the lesion to determine the appropriate management.

Option D, Cryotherapy (double–freeze-thaw method), is not a suitable option, as it is a treatment for benign lesions, and there is no indication that the lesion is benign. Moreover, cryotherapy may not be effective for a lesion of this size and location.

**Answer**: D. Observe

The correct answer is D. Observe because the patient's symptoms and examination results do not indicate a clear indication for surgical intervention. The patient has been experiencing a slowly growing lesion under her left lower eyelid for 3 years, but she has not experienced any visual changes or other symptoms. The lesion is not affecting her vision, and there is no evidence of a life-threatening condition.

Option A, Excisional biopsy of lesion, is not the best choice because it involves surgically removing the lesion, which may not be necessary at this point. The patient's symptoms and examination results do not indicate a clear indication for surgical intervention, and it is possible that the lesion is benign and can be monitored with observation.

Option B, Incisional biopsy of lesion, is also not the best choice because it involves making an incision in the eye to obtain a tissue sample, which carries a higher risk of complications compared to observation.

Option C, Episcleral radioactive plaque treatment, with or without concomitant needle biopsy, is not appropriate because it involves treating the lesion with radioactive material, which may not be necessary at this point. The patient's symptoms and examination results do not indicate a clear indication for treatment, and it is possible that the lesion is benign and can be monitored with observation.

Therefore, the best option is D. Observe, which involves monitoring the patient's condition with regular follow-up appointments to assess any changes in the lesion and to determine if any further intervention is necessary. This approach allows for close monitoring of the patient's condition while minimizing the risk of complications associated with surgical intervention.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain!

**Answer**: B. Streptobacillus moniliformis infection

The patient's symptoms of fever, rash, and arthralgia, along with the presence of petechial and pustular lesions on her hands and feet, are consistent with a diagnosis of Streptobacillus moniliformis infection, also known as rat-bite fever. This bacterial infection is transmitted through the bite of an infected rodent, which is consistent with the patient's exposure to rodents in her home and neighborhood. The patient's swollen and warm joints, particularly in the right elbow and left knee, are also consistent with this diagnosis.

The other answer choices do not fit the patient's symptoms and exposure history as well:

A. Disseminated gonococcal infection: This bacterial infection is typically sexually transmitted and does not explain the patient's rash or joint symptoms.

C. Rocky Mountain spotted fever: This tick-borne illness is characterized by a distinctive rash that starts on the wrists and ankles and spreads to the palms and soles. The patient's rash does not have this distribution, and there is no history of tick exposure.

D. Disseminated Staphylococcus aureus: This bacterial infection can cause fever, rash, and joint symptoms, but it is typically associated with a history of skin or soft tissue infection, surgery, or medical devices. There is no indication of any of these risk factors in the patient's history.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and exposure history, the most likely diagnosis is Streptobacillus moniliformis infection.

**Answer**: C. Gastrocolic fistula

A gastrocolic fistula is a rare condition that occurs when there is an abnormal connection between the stomach and the colon. This can cause a variety of symptoms, including chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss, which are all present in the patient described in the question. The patient's laboratory test results, which showed microcytic anemia and hypoalbuminemia, are also consistent with a gastrointestinal fistula.

The patient's physical examination findings, including acute cachexia, conjunctival pallor, and an immobile nontender mass in the left upper abdomen, are also consistent with a gastrocolic fistula. The mass in the left upper abdomen is likely a result of the fistula, which can cause the intestines to become dilated and form a mass.

The abdominal computed tomography image shown in the question also supports the diagnosis of a gastrocolic fistula. The large central necrotic mass shown in the image is consistent with the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

In contrast, the other answer choices are less likely to cause the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

Gastrointestinal tuberculosis (choice A) can cause chronic diarrhea and weight loss, but it is less likely to cause a mass in the left upper abdomen.

Gastrointestinal stromal tumor with central necrosis (choice B) can cause abdominal pain and weight loss, but it is less likely to cause chronic diarrhea.

Gastric leiomyosarcoma (choice D) is a rare type of stomach cancer that can cause abdominal pain and weight loss, but it is less likely to cause chronic diarrhea.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and laboratory test results, as well as the abdominal computed tomography image, the most likely diagnosis is a gastrocolic fistula.

**Answer**:B. Meckel diverticulum

The patient's symptoms of persistent nausea and vomiting, along with the presence of iron deficiency anemia and hemeoccult-positive stool, suggest an occult gastrointestinal bleeding. The fact that upper and lower endoscopy, computed tomography enterography, PillCam capsule endoscopy, and a Meckel scan failed to identify a source of GI bleeding suggests that the bleeding is coming from a Meckel diverticulum. This is supported by the retrograde double-balloon enteroscopy showing an outpouching in the distal ileum with an accompanying ulceration of the adjacent mucosa. Meckel diverticulum is a rare congenital abnormality that can cause GI bleeding, and it is often difficult to diagnose. The other choices do not fit the patient's symptoms and test results. Intestinal duplication is a rare congenital abnormality that can cause GI bleeding, but it is not associated with Meckel diverticulum. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor is a rare tumor that can cause GI bleeding, but it is not associated with Meckel diverticulum. Small-bowel diverticular disease is a common condition that can cause GI bleeding, but it is not associated with Meckel diverticulum.

**Answer**: C. Lesser sac (omental bursa) internal hernia through the epiploic foramen

The correct answer is C, Lesser sac (omental bursa) internal hernia through the epiploic foramen, because it aligns with the symptoms and findings described in the case.

The patient presented with sudden-onset epigastric and right upper quadrant pain that occurred in paroxysms at 9- to 10-minute intervals, without any previous abdominal surgery. The pain did not migrate during the 3-hour history, and the patient had mild tachycardia and moderate abdominal distension without signs of peritonism. The bowel sounds were hyperactive, and there was no fever, nausea, or vomiting.

These symptoms suggest an obstruction or blockage in the small intestine, which can cause abdominal pain and distension. The absence of fever and leukocytosis suggests that the obstruction is not due to an inflammatory process, such as appendicitis or diverticulitis.

The computed tomography (CT) scan showed a dilated small intestine with a transition point in the right upper quadrant, indicating a possible intestinal obstruction. The arrowheads in the CT scan image indicate the border of the epiploic foramen, which is a normal anatomical structure that can sometimes be mistaken for a pathological process.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a lesser sac (omental bursa) internal hernia through the epiploic foramen, which can cause small intestine obstruction and explain the patient's symptoms.

Now, let's discuss why the other answer choices are incorrect:

A. Abscess of the lesser sac (omental bursa): An abscess would likely cause fever, leukocytosis, and signs of peritonism, which were not present in this case.

B. Perforated ulcer of the posterior stomach wall: A perforated ulcer would likely cause signs of peritonism, fever, and leukocytosis, and the pain

The correct answer is B: This patient most likely has monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS).

Let's go through each answer choice and explain why it's incorrect or correct:

A: The patient most likely has multiple myeloma.

Multiple myeloma is a type of cancer that affects plasma cells in the bone marrow. It's characterized by the presence of M proteins in the blood and urine, which are produced by malignant plasma cells. In this case, the patient's serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation results show a small M-protein peak, which is less than 10% of the total protein. This is not consistent with multiple myeloma, which typically has a much higher level of M protein. Additionally, the patient doesn't have other symptoms or lab results that are consistent with multiple myeloma, such as bone pain, anemia, infection, or renal impairment.

C: The patient most likely has Waldenström macroglobulinemia.

Waldenström macroglobulinemia is a type of cancer that affects plasma cells in the bone marrow. It's characterized by the presence of a macroglobulin (an M protein) in the blood, which is produced by malignant plasma cells. In this case, the patient's serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation results don't show a macroglobulin peak, which is inconsistent with Waldenström macroglobulinemia.

D: This patient most likely has light chain monoclonal gammopathy.

Light chain monoclonal gammopathy is a condition where there's an excess of light chains (either kappa or lambda) in the blood. In this case, the patient's serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation results show a small M-protein peak, but they don't show any evidence of light chain excess.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). MG

**Answer**:B. Prescribe systemic corticosteroids

The correct answer is B, Prescribe systemic corticosteroids, because the patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum, a rare autoimmune disease that is often associated with inflammatory bowel disease, such as Crohn's disease. The patient's history of mild diarrhea and recent onset of severe leg ulceration are consistent with this diagnosis.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is characterized by the rapid progression of painful ulcerations, often with a violaceous border and a necrotic center, and is often associated with systemic symptoms such as fever, malaise, and weight loss. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results, including anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and fecal occult blood, are consistent with this diagnosis.

The histopathological changes described in the patient's skin lesions, including dermal edema with dense infiltration of neutrophils and vascular fibrinoid necrosis, are also consistent with pyoderma gangrenosum.

Systemic corticosteroids are the primary treatment for pyoderma gangrenosum, as they can help to reduce inflammation and promote healing. In addition, immunosuppressive medications such as azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil may be considered for long-term management.

In contrast, choices A and C are not appropriate for this patient's condition. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy may be beneficial for some types of wounds, but it is not a primary treatment for pyoderma gangrenosum. Surgical excision of the lesion followed by skin grafting may be necessary in some cases, but it is not the first-line treatment for this condition.

Choice D, continuing with broad-spectrum antibiotics, may be appropriate for a patient with a bacterial infection, but it is not the primary treatment for pyoderma gangrenosum. The patient's negative cultures and lack of response to antibiotics suggest that the ulceration is not primarily caused by a bacterial infection.

The correct answer is D. Type II non–ST-elevation MI related to acute increase in myocardial oxygen demand.

Let's go through each of the answer choices and explain why they are incorrect:

A. Chronic elevation in cardiac troponin T (cTnT) due to left ventricular hypertrophy.

This choice is incorrect because the patient's cTnT level is elevated acutely, not chronically. The patient's history of hypertension and LVH suggests that there may be chronic elevation of cTnT, but the sudden onset of chest pain and shortness of breath suggests an acute event.

B. Elevated cTnT due to skeletal muscle injury.

This choice is incorrect because there is no evidence of skeletal muscle injury in the patient's history or physical examination. While skeletal muscle injury can cause elevated cTnT levels, it is not the most likely explanation for the patient's symptoms and lab results.

C. Type I non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI) due to atherosclerotic plaque rupture.

This choice is incorrect because the patient's coronary angiogram did not show any significant obstructive coronary artery disease. Type I MI occurs when there is a complete occlusion of a coronary artery, leading to a large area of myocardial necrosis. While the patient's history of hypertension and LVH increases her risk for atherosclerotic disease, the absence of significant coronary stenosis makes Type I MI less likely.

D. Type II non–ST-elevation MI related to acute increase in myocardial oxygen demand.

This choice is correct because it takes into account the patient's acute symptoms, elevated cTnT level, and the absence of significant coronary stenosis. Type II MI occurs when there is an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand, leading to myocardial necrosis. The patient's history of hypertension and LVH increases

**Answer**:A. The patient has latent syphilis and requires 2.4 million U intramuscularly of benzathine penicillin G weekly for 3 doses (total 7.2 million U penicillin).

The patient's reactive syphilis test results indicate that they have been infected with syphilis, and their lack of recall of a previous diagnosis or treatment and the absence of any documentation of syphilis testing in the local health department suggest that this is a new infection. The patient's negative HIV EIA and hepatitis B virus serologies consistent with previous immunization suggest that they do not have HIV or hepatitis B co-infection.

The patient's symptoms of dysuria, which resolved after treatment for gonococcal urethritis, suggest that they may have had a concurrent sexually transmitted infection. However, the absence of any other symptoms or physical examination findings consistent with syphilis, such as rash, lymphadenopathy, or neurologic deficits, suggest that they do not have primary or secondary syphilis.

Therefore, based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory results, it is most likely that they have latent syphilis, which requires treatment with benzathine penicillin G. The recommended dose is 2.4 million U intramuscularly weekly for 3 doses, for a total of 7.2 million U penicillin.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

B: The patient's reactive syphilis test results and lack of recall of previous diagnosis or treatment suggest that they have not had a previous exposure to syphilis and therefore do not have a serofast state.

C: The patient's reactive syphilis test results suggest that they have been infected with syphilis, and there is no indication that the test results are falsely elevated.

D: The patient does not have any symptoms or physical examination findings consistent with asymptomatic neurosyphilis, and there is no indication for a lumbar puncture to assess for this condition.

B. Ordering a nutritional assay to evaluate for vitamin B3 (niacin) deficiency may be appropriate, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management.

C. Recommending increased use of an alcohol-based mouthwash to improve oral hygiene may help with oral hygiene, but it will not address the underlying cause of the lesions.

D. Biopsy the affected tissue is the most appropriate next step in management as it will help to establish a definitive diagnosis of the lesions. A biopsy can help to rule out other conditions such as oral lichen planus, oral lichenoid reactions, and oral cancer.

Sure! Here's my explanation:

**Answer**: C. Hypoplasminogenemia

The correct diagnosis is hypoplasminogenemia, which is a rare genetic disorder that affects the plasminogen system. The plasminogen system plays a crucial role in the breakdown of blood clots and the regulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover. Hypoplasminogenemia is characterized by a deficiency of plasminogen, which is converted to plasmin, a proteolytic enzyme that breaks down fibrin clots and ECM components.

The patient's symptoms of recurrent oral mucosal ulcerations and gingival edema are consistent with hypoplasminogenemia. The patient's history of ligneous conjunctivitis, which is a chronic inflammatory condition affecting the conjunctiva, also supports this diagnosis. The patient's easy bruising and prolonged bleeding, as well as the presence of nodular ulceration of the left maxillary gingiva, are also consistent with hypoplasminogenemia.

The histopathological findings of aggregates of relatively amorphous, eosinophilic material beneath the epithelium and around blood vessels, as seen in the punch biopsy specimen from the maxillary gingiva, are consistent with the histopathological changes seen in hypoplasminogenemia.

The other choices are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and histopathological findings:

A. Amyloidosis: This is a condition where abnormal proteins accumulate in tissues, leading to the formation of fibrillar aggregates. While amyloidosis can cause oral mucosal ulcerations, the patient's history of recurrent ulcerations and the presence of ligneous conjunctivitis do not support this diagnosis.

**Answer**: C. Neonatal pemphigus vulgaris

Pemphigus vulgaris is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the skin and mucous membranes. It is caused by the production of autoantibodies against desmoglein, a protein that helps to maintain the integrity of the skin's epithelial cells. In neonatal pemphigus vulgaris, the disease manifests in newborns, typically within the first few weeks of life.

The clinical presentation of neonatal pemphigus vulgaris is characterized by widespread vesicles and erosions on the skin, which can be quite extensive and can involve the trunk, limbs, and scalp. The mucous membranes are usually spared. The histopathological analysis of skin biopsies shows suprabasilar acantholysis, which means that the cells in the upper layers of the epidermis are separated from the basement membrane, leading to the formation of intraepidermal blisters. Direct immunofluorescence analysis of perilesional skin can demonstrate the presence of IgG antibodies in an intracellular "chicken wire" pattern, which is a characteristic feature of pemphigus vulgaris.

In the case presented, the clinical and histopathological findings are consistent with neonatal pemphigus vulgaris. The presence of extensive erosions and vesicles on the skin, sparing of mucous membranes, and the histopathological features of suprabasilar acantholysis and IgG deposition in an intracellular pattern, all support this diagnosis.

**Answer**: C. Neutrophilic sebaceous adenitis (NSA)

The correct diagnosis for the patient's condition is Neutrophilic Sebaceous Adenitis (NSA). This is based on the combination of the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and the results of the punch biopsy.

The patient's symptoms of a sudden onset of annular plaques with raised erythematous-violaceous borders on the face and torso, along with the absence of itching or pain, are consistent with NSA. The fact that the lesions began on the upper back and spread to the face, and the presence of coalescing lesions on the back, are also typical of NSA.

The physical examination findings of multiple annular plaques with raised erythematous-violaceous borders on the face and back, and the absence of any other mucocutaneous findings, are also consistent with NSA.

The punch biopsy results showed distended sebaceous lobules with associated follicular dilatation and a mild chronic perivascular and perifollicular lymphomononuclear infiltrate, which is consistent with NSA. Additionally, the presence of sebaceous lobules with sebocyte necrosis and an associated neutrophilic infiltrate that includes scattered lymphomononuclear cells, supports the diagnosis of NSA.

Now, let's discuss why the other answer choices are incorrect:

A. Granuloma annulare: This is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by the formation of annular granulomas. However, the patient's lesions lack the characteristic central clearing and are not associated with a granuloma.

**Answer**:B. Erythema ab igne with superimposed chemotherapy effect

Erythema ab igne is a condition that occurs when the skin is exposed to heat, leading to inflammation and redness. In this case, the patient's exposure to the heat of the fireplace for extended periods likely caused the erythematous plaque on his back. The patient's history of stage IV, progressive, neuroendocrine pancreatic cancer and the use of chemotherapeutic regimens, including oral etoposide, daily pancrelipase, and monthly octreotide acetate intramuscular injections, may have contributed to the development of erythema ab igne. The patient's cancer diagnosis and treatment may have compromised his immune system, making him more susceptible to the effects of heat on the skin.

Psoriasis vulgaris, choice A, is an autoimmune condition that causes red, scaly patches on the skin. While it is possible that the patient may have developed psoriasis as a result of his cancer treatment, the reticulated, erythematous plaque with micaceous and silvery scale localized to the mid-back is not typical of psoriasis.

Pityriasis rubra pilaris, choice C, is a rare skin condition characterized by reddish-brown, scaly patches on the skin. It is often associated with other conditions such as atopic dermatitis, eczema, or psoriasis. While the patient's history of seasonal rhinitis may suggest an underlying atopic condition, the clinical presentation of the erythematous plaque on his back does not fit the typical appearance of pityriasis rubra pilaris.

Cutaneous lupus erythematosus, choice D, is a rare autoimmune condition that affects the skin and can cause red, scaly patches or lesions. While it is possible that the patient's cancer treatment may have triggered an autoimmune response, the clinical presentation of the erythematous plaque on his back does not fit the typical appearance of cutaneous lupus erythematosus.

**Answer**:B. Obtain optical coherence tomography

The correct answer is B. Obtain optical coherence tomography because it is the most appropriate step to evaluate the retinal thickness and presence of any retinal fluid or edema, which can help in the diagnosis and management of the patient's condition.

A. Perform ocular ultrasonography: Ocular ultrasonography can be used to evaluate the retinal thickness and presence of any retinal fluid or edema, but it is not the most appropriate step in this case. The patient has already undergone a comprehensive ophthalmic examination, including slitlamp examination and ophthalmoscopy, which have revealed no abnormalities in the anterior segment and a normal retinal vessels. Therefore, performing ocular ultrasonography may not provide any additional information that can help in the diagnosis and management of the patient's condition.

C. Obtain blood tests for vasculitis workup: The patient's history of sudden-onset vision loss and the findings on fundus autofluorescence and fluorescein angiography suggest a possible diagnosis of retinal vasculitis. However, obtaining blood tests for vasculitis workup may not be the most appropriate step at this point. The patient's age and medical history, including hypertension and diabetes mellitus, increase the likelihood of a cardiovascular etiology for the vision loss. Therefore, it is more appropriate to perform an imaging study, such as optical coherence tomography, to evaluate the retinal thickness and presence of any retinal fluid or edema, which can help in the diagnosis and management of the patient's condition.

D. Administer intravitreal injection of an anti–vascular endothelial growth factor agent: While anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents are commonly used to treat retinal vasculitis, it is not the most appropriate step in this case.

**Answer**:B. Emergent angiography

Explanation:

A. Immediate surgical re-exploration: This choice may seem appropriate given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, but it is not the most appropriate next step. The patient's symptoms of acute visual loss and ophthalmoplegia are concerning for a potential posterior circulation stroke or vasculopathy, and urgent imaging is needed to confirm the diagnosis and guide management. Surgical re-exploration may be necessary later, but it is not the first step.

B. Emergent angiography: This choice is correct because it allows for urgent evaluation of the patient's vasculature and can help diagnose potential causes of acute visual loss and ophthalmoplegia, such as a posterior circulation stroke, aneurysm, or stenosis. Angiography can also guide management decisions, such as endovascular thrombectomy or stenting.

C. Immediate anticoagulation: This choice may be appropriate later in the patient's management, but it is not the most urgent next step. Anticoagulation therapy may be used to prevent further ischemic damage or stroke, but it is not a substitute for urgent imaging and diagnosis.

D. Lateral canthotomy and cantholysis: This choice is not appropriate for this patient's presentation. Lateral canthotomy and cantholysis are typically used to treat orbital cellulitis or abscess, not acute visual loss and ophthalmoplegia.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Emergent angiography.

**Answer**: D. Infantile myofibroma

The correct answer is D. Infantile myofibroma because it is a benign tumor that commonly occurs in infants and young children, typically presenting as a mass in the soft tissues of the body, such as the chest or neck. Infantile myofibroma is a rare tumor, accounting for only 1-3% of all childhood soft tissue tumors. It is important to note that this diagnosis is usually made after other possible causes of a chest mass in a newborn have been excluded.

A. Infantile hemangioma is an incorrect choice because it is a benign vascular tumor that usually appears as a red, purple, or blue discoloration of the skin, and is not typically firm or round.

B. Neuroblastoma is an incorrect choice because it is a malignant tumor that develops from the sympathetic nervous system and usually presents with symptoms such as fever, pain, and difficulty breathing. It is also relatively rare in newborns.

C. Dermoid cyst is an incorrect choice because it is a benign growth that contains skin cells, hair follicles, and sweat glands, and usually presents as a small, painless lump or swelling in the skin or subcutaneous tissue. It is not typically firm or round, and does not have the same mobile quality as the mass described in the case.

Therefore, based on the symptoms and characteristics described in the case, the most likely diagnosis is D. Infantile myofibroma.

**Answer**: B. Sclerosing encapsulated peritonitis

The patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, along with the physical examination findings of distension and tenderness, suggest an obstruction or inflammation in the small intestine. The contrast-enhanced CT scan shows dilated small intestine with air-fluid levels extending to the terminal ileum, which is consistent with a mechanical obstruction. The presence of adhesions and a twisted segment of small intestine supports the diagnosis of sclerosing encapsulated peritonitis.

Peritoneal mesothelioma, choice A, is a type of cancer that affects the lining of the abdominal cavity. While it can cause abdominal pain and distension, it is not typically associated with bowel obstruction or twisting.

Malrotation with Ladd bands, choice C, is a congenital condition where the intestines are abnormally rotated and can cause bowel obstruction. However, it is not typically associated with adhesions or twisting of the small intestine.

Peritoneal encapsulation, choice D, is a condition where the peritoneum becomes inflamed and forms a capsule around the small intestine, causing bowel obstruction. While this can cause similar symptoms to sclerosing encapsulated peritonitis, it is not typically associated with adhesions or twisting of the small intestine.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is sclerosing encapsulated peritonitis.

**Answer**:B. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor

The patient's symptoms of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding and melena, along with the presence of a large, complex, septated abdominal mass on imaging, suggest a possible diagnosis of a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). GISTs are a type of sarcoma that originates in the gastrointestinal tract and can cause bleeding due to their vascular nature. The patient's history of generalized weakness and fatigue, as well as his recent weight loss, also support the diagnosis of a GIST.

The other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.

A. Carcinoid tumor: While carcinoid tumors can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, they typically do not present with a large, complex abdominal mass. Additionally, carcinoid tumors are typically slow-growing and may not cause symptoms until they have reached a advanced stage.

C. Neurofibroma: Neurofibromas are benign tumors that originate in the nervous system and do not typically cause gastrointestinal bleeding or abdominal masses.

D. Intra-abdominal abscess: An intra-abdominal abscess can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, fever, and chills, but it would not explain the patient's history of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding or the imaging findings of a large, complex abdominal mass.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST).

**Answer**: A. The patient has asymptomatic pyuria and bacteriuria.

Let's break down each answer choice and explain why they are incorrect or correct:

A. The patient has asymptomatic pyuria and bacteriuria.

This is the correct answer. The patient's urine output, urinalysis, and urine culture all indicate that she has a urinary tract infection (UTI). The presence of pyuria (pus in the urine) and bacteriuria (bacteria in the urine) are both indicative of a UTI. The fact that the patient is afebrile (does not have a fever) and does not report any abdominal, suprapubic, or flank tenderness does not rule out a UTI, as these symptoms are not always present in elderly patients with UTIs.

B. The patient has a UTI because of chronic incontinence and a positive urine culture.

This answer is incorrect because while chronic incontinence may increase the risk of UTIs, it is not a sufficient reason to diagnose a UTI in this case. The patient's symptoms and urinalysis results do not support this diagnosis.

C. A positive urinalysis and urine culture are always a UTI.

This answer is incorrect because a positive urine culture alone does not confirm a UTI. A positive urine culture can be caused by contamination or other factors, and a UTI requires both a positive urine culture and symptoms consistent with a UTI.

D. Since the patient has a history of recurrent UTIs, these urine test results indicate that she has another UTI.

This answer is incorrect because while a history of recurrent UTIs may increase the likelihood of a UTI, it is not sufficient to diagnose a UTI without other supporting symptoms and test results. In this case, the patient's symptoms and urinalysis results do not support a UTI diagnosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is A. The patient has asymptomatic pyuria and bacteriuria.

**Answer**: C. Consult neurosurgery for biopsy

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of left facial droop and left leg weakness, along with the abnormal MRI findings of multiloculated ring-enhancing fluid collections involving the right basal ganglia, insula, and frontal lobe, suggest a possible diagnosis of a brain abscess. A brain abscess is a collection of pus in the brain that can be caused by bacterial, viral, or fungal infections. The presence of a brain abscess can cause a variety of symptoms, including weakness or paralysis of the face, arm, or leg on one side of the body, difficulty with speech and swallowing, and changes in vision, memory, or behavior.

Given the patient's history of hypertension and chronic kidney disease, it is important to consider the possibility of a brain abscess caused by a bacterial infection, such as Streptococcus pneumoniae or Staphylococcus aureus. The patient's recent travel to upstate New York and exposure to ticks increases the likelihood of a tick-borne illness, such as Lyme disease or babesiosis, which can also cause a brain abscess.

Therefore, the next step in the patient's management would be to consult neurosurgery for biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of a brain abscess and to identify the underlying cause, whether it is bacterial, viral, or fungal. This will help guide further management and treatment.

The other options are not the most appropriate next steps in the patient's management:

A. Begin therapy with intravenous ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and metronidazole: While antibiotics may be appropriate for treating a bacterial infection causing a brain abscess, the choice of antibiotics and the duration of treatment need to be guided by the results of the biopsy and the identification of the underlying cause. Starting antibiotics without a confirmed diagnosis may not effectively treat the underlying infection and may lead to unnecessary side effects.

B. Perform a lumbar puncture: A lumbar puncture may be used to

**Answer**: C. Prescribe oral anthelmintic therapy

The correct answer is C. Prescribe oral anthelmintic therapy, because the patient's symptoms suggest a possible diagnosis of cutaneous larva migrans, which is a parasitic infection caused by the larvae of hookworms. The patient's recent travel to Puerto Rico, where hookworms are endemic, increases the likelihood of this diagnosis.

Oral anthelmintic therapy, such as albendazole or mebendazole, is the treatment of choice for cutaneous larva migrans. These medications are effective against hookworms and can help eliminate the parasites from the body, thereby resolving the symptoms.

Now, let's discuss why the other answer choices are incorrect:

A. Do nothing; it will resolve with time: While it's true that some cases of cutaneous larva migrans may resolve on their own over time, it's not appropriate to do nothing and wait for the symptoms to resolve. The patient is experiencing intense pruritus, which can be uncomfortable and disruptive to daily life. Moreover, without treatment, the patient may continue to experience symptoms for weeks or even months, which can negatively impact their quality of life.

B. Prescribe topical steroids: Topical steroids may provide some relief for the patient's pruritus, but they are not the most appropriate treatment for cutaneous larva migrans. The patient's symptoms are caused by the presence of parasites in the skin, and topical steroids will not eliminate the parasites.

D. Prescribe oral antibiotics: Oral antibiotics are not effective against parasitic infections such as cutaneous larva migrans. While antibiotics may be prescribed to treat any secondary bacterial infections that may have developed, they are not the primary treatment for the parasitic infection itself.

I hope this explanation helps clarify the correct answer!

**Answer**: B. The patient has LTBI.

The correct answer is B because the patient's positive TST result and negative chest radiograph suggest that they have LTBI. The patient's recent arrival from a high-TB-incidence country and lack of symptoms also support this diagnosis. The IGRA test results further support this diagnosis, as a positive IGRA result indicates that the patient has been infected with M. tuberculosis.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. The patient has active TB: This answer is incorrect because the patient does not have any symptoms of active TB disease, and their chest radiograph was unremarkable.

C. The patient does not have LTBI. No further evaluation is needed: This answer is incorrect because the patient's positive TST result and IGRA result indicate that they have been infected with M. tuberculosis, and further evaluation is needed to determine whether they have LTBI or active TB disease.

D. The patient needs further evaluation for active TB disease: This answer is incorrect because the patient does not have any symptoms of active TB disease, and their chest radiograph was unremarkable. While further evaluation may be needed to determine the extent of the patient's infection, it is not necessary to evaluate for active TB disease specifically.

**Answer**:B. Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results, as well as the histopathological findings from the punch biopsy specimen, are consistent with a diagnosis of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type.

The patient's rapidly enlarging nodular plaques on the leg, tender subcutaneous mass on the thigh, and subcutaneous nodule on the cheek are consistent with the skin involvement often seen in extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma. The patient's elevated LDH level and normal complete blood cell count, serum chemical analyses, and liver function tests also support this diagnosis.

The histopathological findings from the punch biopsy specimen demonstrate angiocentrism, with large atypical lymphoid cells infiltrating a vessel, which is a characteristic feature of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma. Additionally, the atypical lymphocytic infiltrate is strongly positive for EBV, as shown by EBV-encoded RNA in situ hybridization, which supports the diagnosis of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma.

Cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) (choice A) typically presents with solitary or multiple skin nodules, but the histopathological features are different from those seen in extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma. ALCL typically shows a variable number of mitoses, necrosis, and apoptosis, and the tumor cells are positive for CD30 and negative for EBV.

Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (choice B) typically presents with skin involvement, as seen in this patient, and the histopathological features are consistent with this diagnosis.

**Answer**:C. Generalized essential telangiectasia

The correct answer is C. Generalized essential telangiectasia because it matches the patient's symptoms and clinical findings, which include progressive widespread cutaneous telangiectasias on the bilateral arms, lower legs, and feet, with no associated inflammation or fibrinoid necrosis.

A. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by recurrent epistaxis, telangiectasias, and visceral organ involvement. While HHT can present with cutaneous telangiectasias, the absence of a family history, the lack of mucosal or conjunctival involvement, and the absence of other organ involvement make HHT less likely in this case.

B. Cutaneous collagenous vasculopathy (CCV) is a rare condition characterized by the presence of collagenous deposits in the walls of small blood vessels, leading to the formation of telangiectasias and papillomatoses. However, CCV typically presents with a more sudden onset, and the lesions are usually more tender and pruritic than those described in the patient's case.

D. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that can present with various skin manifestations, including telangiectasias. However, the patient's lack of other SLE symptoms, such as malar rash, photosensitivity, and joint pain, and the absence of laboratory findings suggestive of SLE, make it less likely.

Therefore, based on the patient's clinical presentation and histopathological findings, the most likely diagnosis is Generalized essential telangiectasia.

**Answer**:C. Langerhans cell histiocytosis

The correct answer is C. Langerhans cell histiocytosis because it matches the given symptoms and characteristics.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare, benign, and chronic inflammatory skin condition that typically affects the intertriginous areas, such as the armpits, groin, and inframammary regions. The symptoms of LCH include pain, pruritus, and serous discharge associated with the plaques, which are consistent with the patient's reported symptoms. The patient's medical history, which is unremarkable, also supports this diagnosis.

The physical examination findings, such as well-demarcated, moist, erythematous plaques and erosions in the bilateral inframammary regions, and scattered excoriated papules on the scalp, are also consistent with LCH. The punch biopsy specimen of the plaque along the left inframammary region showed abundant atypical cells within the epidermis and papillary dermis, which is a characteristic feature of LCH. The immunohistochemical analysis also supports the diagnosis of LCH.

In contrast, intertrigo (choice A) is a common inflammatory skin condition that occurs in the intertriginous areas, but it is usually associated with mechanical friction, moisture, and heat, which is not mentioned in the patient's history. Hailey-Hailey disease (choice B) is a rare genodermatosis that is characterized by chronic, recurrent, and painful vesiculopustular lesions in the intertriginous areas, but it typically has a positive family history and is associated with mutations in the ATP2C1 gene, which is not mentioned in the patient's history. Inverse psoriasis (choice D) is a type of psoriasis that affects the flexural areas, such as the groin, armpits, and inframammary regions, but it typically has a different appearance, with smooth, shiny, and red plaques, and is not associated with the abundant atypical cells seen in LCH.

**Answer**: B. OCT imaging

The patient presented with a "shadow" over her right eye, which suggests a possible retinal issue. The external examination revealed ecchymosis and periorbital edema, which further supports the possibility of a retinal injury. The anterior segment examination was within normal limits, but the posterior segment examination demonstrated whitening of the macula with a central red spot consistent with posterior pole commotio retinae, flame-shaped hemorrhages, and cotton-wool spots. These findings are consistent with a retinal injury caused by the airbag deployment.

Given these findings, it is important to perform an OCT imaging to further evaluate the extent of the retinal injury. OCT imaging can provide detailed images of the retina and help identify any structural changes, such as retinal thickening, fluid accumulation, or macular hole. In this case, the OCT imaging revealed subfoveal debris with distortion of the normal foveal architecture, which suggests a possible retinal detachment or macular hole.

Therefore, option B, OCT imaging, is the correct answer. It is the next step in the evaluation of the patient's retinal injury and will help guide further management.

Option A, reassure and observe, is not appropriate at this stage, as the patient has already reported a significant decrease in visual acuity and the examination findings suggest a retinal injury. It is important to further evaluate the extent of the injury and provide appropriate treatment.

Option C, evaluate for secondary gain, is not relevant in this case, as there is no indication of a secondary gain.

Option D, electroretinogram, is not necessary at this stage, as the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a retinal injury rather than a functional issue. An electroretinogram may be considered in the future if there are concerns about retinal function.

**Answer**:C. Anterior chamber paracentesis for polymerase chain reaction

The patient's symptoms and clinical findings, such as bilateral decreased vision, keratic precipitates, anterior chamber cells, retinal hemorrhages, and cystoid macular edema, suggest a possible infectious or inflammatory etiology. The presence of a creamy white lesion emanating from the optic nerve and perivascular sheathing along the vascular arcades in the right eye, and a peripapillary preretinal gliotic lesion with fine retinal striae and a macular star configuration of exudates in the left eye, further support this possibility.

Option C, anterior chamber paracentesis for polymerase chain reaction (PCR), is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient. PCR is a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic tool that can detect viral or bacterial DNA in the anterior chamber fluid, which can aid in the diagnosis of infectious causes of retinitis and retinal hemorrhages. The presence of keratic precipitates and anterior chamber cells suggests that there may be an active inflammatory process in the eye, which could be caused by an infectious agent. By performing PCR on the anterior chamber fluid, the clinician can identify the presence of any viral or bacterial pathogens that may be causing the patient's symptoms and signs.

Option A, diagnostic pars plana vitrectomy, is not the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient. While vitrectomy can be a valuable diagnostic tool in certain cases, it is not necessary at this point in the patient's management. The patient's symptoms and clinical findings suggest an infectious or inflammatory etiology, and PCR can help to confirm or rule out this possibility without the need for a more invasive procedure like vitrectomy. Additionally, vitrectomy carries a higher risk of complications compared to PCR.

Option B, neuroimaging of brain and orbits, may be considered in the management of this patient, but it is not the most appropriate next step. While neuroimaging can help to identify any intracranial or orbital abnormalities that may

**Answer**: A. Microcystic lymphatic malformation

The correct answer is A, Microcystic lymphatic malformation, because the clinical and histopathological features described in the case are consistent with this diagnosis.

Microcystic lymphatic malformations are benign vascular lesions that are characterized by dilated thin-walled vascular spaces containing valvelike papillary projections in the superficial dermis. The overlying epidermis often shows acanthosis and hyperkeratosis. These lesions are typically present at birth or develop in early childhood and can be associated with other congenital anomalies.

In this case, the patient presented with a large, cobblestoned plaque on the right posterior thigh, composed of numerous purplish, vesicular papules with surrounding satellite papules. The clinical appearance of the lesion is consistent with a microcystic lymphatic malformation. The histopathological examination of the punch biopsy also supports this diagnosis, as it shows dilated thin-walled vascular spaces containing valvelike papillary projections in the superficial dermis, along with acanthosis and hyperkeratosis of the overlying epidermis.

In contrast, the other answer choices do not fit the clinical and histopathological features of the case.

B, Congenital melanocytic nevus, is not a correct diagnosis because the lesion described in the case does not have the characteristic features of a congenital melanocytic nevus, such as a darkly pigmented macule or patch, and the histopathological examination does not show an accumulation of melanocytes.

**Answer**: A. Dropped gallstones

The correct answer is A. Dropped gallstones because the patient's symptoms and test results suggest a biliary tract obstruction, which can be caused by gallstones. The patient's jaundice, elevated bilirubin level, and abdominal pain are all consistent with a blockage in the bile ducts. Additionally, the CT scan shows a mass in the second and third portions of the duodenum, which is consistent with a gallstone obstruction.

B. Lymphoma is an incorrect choice because there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has lymphoma. While lymphoma can cause abdominal pain and jaundice, it is not typically associated with a mass in the duodenum.

C. Peritoneal carcinomatosis is also an incorrect choice because there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has cancer in the peritoneum. While peritoneal carcinomatosis can cause abdominal pain and jaundice, it is not typically associated with a mass in the duodenum.

D. Peritoneal mesothelioma is a rare type of cancer that affects the lining of the abdominal cavity. While it can cause abdominal pain and jaundice, it is not typically associated with a mass in the duodenum. Additionally, the patient's history of a previous laparoscopic cholecystectomy suggests that the patient has a history of gallstone disease, which makes it more likely that the current symptoms are related to gallstones rather than mesothelioma.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and test results, the most likely diagnosis is dropped gallstones.

**Answer**: C. Nodular fasciitis

Nodular fasciitis is a benign tumor that arises from the fascia, which is the connective tissue that surrounds muscles and other soft tissue structures. It is characterized by a rapidly growing, painless mass that is usually located in the superficial soft tissues of the extremities or trunk. The tumor is composed of fibroblasts, myofibroblasts, and inflammatory cells, and it can cause significant local inflammation and swelling.

In this case, the patient presented with a tender right-flank mass that had been growing in size over the past week, and was noticed after falling and sustaining trauma to the area. The mass was firm and fixed to the abdominal wall musculature, and laboratory examination and ultrasonography revealed no abnormalities. A noncontrast magnetic resonance image (MRI) showed a well-circumscribed T2 hyperintense lesion with diffuse surrounding soft tissue edema within the adjacent muscular and subcutaneous tissues. These findings are consistent with nodular fasciitis.

The patient's history of a total thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid cancer and a strong family history of malignant breast cancer on the maternal side and colon and liver cancer on the paternal side increased her risk of developing a malignant tumor. However, the patient's age and the fact that the tumor was asymptomatic and decreased in size over time suggest that nodular fasciitis is a more likely diagnosis than a malignant tumor such as leiomyosarcoma.

The other answer choices are less likely diagnoses for this patient's condition. Desmoid fibromatosis is a rare benign tumor that arises from the fibroblasts and myofibroblasts in the soft tissues, but it typically grows slowly and does not cause significant local inflammation or swelling.

**Answer**:C. Perform leishmaniasis polymerase chain reaction testing of biopsied tissue

Explanation:

C. Perform leishmaniasis polymerase chain reaction testing of biopsied tissue is the correct answer because it is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's condition. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, including nasal erythema and crusting, suggest a possible diagnosis of leishmaniasis, a parasitic infection caused by Leishmania protozoa. The biopsy results showing pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia and lymphoplasmocytic inflammation, also support this diagnosis.

Performing a leishmaniasis polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test on the biopsied tissue will help to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management. PCR is a highly sensitive and specific test that can detect the genetic material of Leishmania parasites in tissue samples. A positive PCR result will confirm the diagnosis of leishmaniasis, while a negative result will suggest an alternative diagnosis.

The other answer choices are not appropriate next steps in the management of this patient's condition:

A. Obtain immunofluorescence of biopsied tissue: Immunofluorescence is a technique that uses antibodies to detect specific proteins or other molecules in tissue samples. It may be useful in diagnosing certain conditions, but it is not specific for leishmaniasis and is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis in this case.

B. Perform biopsy with oncology consultation: While a biopsy may be necessary to obtain tissue for further testing, an oncology consultation is not necessary at this point, as there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has cancer.

D. Prescribe intravenous vancomycin for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection: Vancomycin is an antibiotic that is effective against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has a MRSA infection,

**Answer**: B. Order flow cytometry of the peripheral blood sample

Flow cytometry is a diagnostic test that uses lasers to analyze the characteristics of cells, including their size, shape, and surface markers. It is particularly useful in diagnosing and monitoring blood disorders, including leukemia and lymphoma. In this case, the patient's abnormal white blood cell count and lymphocytic predominance suggest a possible hematological malignancy, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). Flow cytometry can help confirm this diagnosis by analyzing the surface markers and DNA ploidy of the lymphocytes.

Option A, ordering a mononucleosis test, may be appropriate if the patient had a history of exposure to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) or symptoms consistent with infectious mononucleosis, such as fever, sore throat, and swollen lymph nodes. However, the patient's symptoms of weakness, fatigue, and night sweats are not typical of infectious mononucleosis, and the lymphocytic predominance on the peripheral blood smear suggests a different diagnosis.

Option C, performing an excisional lymph node biopsy, may be necessary if the diagnosis is still uncertain after flow cytometry or other diagnostic tests. However, it is an invasive procedure that carries risks and should be reserved for cases where the diagnosis cannot be made by less invasive means.

Option D, requesting computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen with contrast, may be appropriate to rule out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a lung or liver malignancy. However, it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as the patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a hematological malignancy, which would not be detected by CT imaging.

Therefore, the correct answer is B, Order flow cytometry of the peripheral blood sample.

NEH is a rare adverse event associated with chemotherapy, characterized by a painful, violaceous, and indurated plaque on the perivulvar area, sparing the vaginal mucosa and inguinal creases. The patient's symptoms, including fever, rigors, periorbital swelling, and bilateral injected conjunctivae, are also consistent with NEH.

The histopathological findings shown in Figures B and C support the diagnosis of NEH. The spongiosis and hyperplasia of the epidermis with a neutrophilic infiltrate within the dermis (Figure B) and the necrotic collagen and eccrine gland destruction (Figure C) are characteristic features of NEH.

In contrast, the other answer choices do not match the clinical presentation or histopathological findings:

A. Sweet syndrome: This is an uncommon side effect of chemotherapy, characterized by fever, malaise, and a painful, edematous, and violaceous plaque on the skin. However, Sweet syndrome typically involves the face, neck, and upper limbs, and spares the perivulvar area.

B. Herpes genitalis: This is a viral infection that can cause perivulvar lesions, but it typically presents with grouped vesicles, ulcers, or crusting, rather than the violaceous and indurated plaques described in the case.

C. Deep fungal or atypical mycobacterial infection: These infections can cause perivulvar lesions, but they typically present with ulcers, draining sinuses, and other signs of chronic infection, rather than the acute onset and violaceous color described in the case.

**Answer**: C. Porokeratosis ptychotropica (PP)

Explanation:

* A. Psoriasis: Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by scaly, erythematous plaques. While it can affect the perianal area and buttocks, the clinical presentation and histopathological features of psoriasis are not consistent with the case described. The patient's lesions have well-demarcated keratotic margins and a structureless brownish pigmentation on dermoscopy, which is not typical of psoriasis.
* B. Lichen planus: Lichen planus is an inflammatory skin condition that can cause pruritic, flat-topped, polygonal papules. However, the patient's lesions have a distinctive clinical appearance, with confluent, hyperkeratotic, and purplish-brown papules and plaques, which are not consistent with lichen planus. Additionally, the histopathological features of lichen planus, such as the presence of sawtooth-like rete ridges, are not evident in the biopsy specimen.
* D. Cutaneous graft-vs-host disease: Cutaneous graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) is a complication that can occur after allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. It is characterized by a lymphocytic infiltrate and skin damage. While the patient has a history of heterologous bone marrow transplantation, the clinical and histopathological features of GVHD are not consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's lesions do not have the characteristic features of GVHD, such as a lymphocytic infiltrate, and the biopsy specimen does not show evidence of skin damage.

In contrast, Porokeratosis ptychotropica (PP) is a rare, chronic, inflammatory skin condition characterized by the development of hyperkeratotic papules and plaques, often on the buttocks and perianal area. The clinical presentation and histopathological features of PP are consistent with the case described. The patient's lesions have

**Answer**:B. Bullous prurigo pigmentosa

Bullous prurigo pigmentosa (BPP) is a rare, chronic skin condition characterized by the development of pruritic, inflammatory, and bullous lesions on sun-exposed areas, particularly on the neck, upper back, and buttocks. The condition typically affects young adults, and the exact cause is unknown.

The clinical presentation of the patient in the case, with a 4-month history of a pruritic eruption that started on his neck, upper back, and buttocks, and the presence of bullae on an erythematous base in a reticular pattern, is consistent with BPP. The patient's age, lack of family history, and absence of any antecedent illness or exposure also support this diagnosis.

The histopathological findings, as shown in the biopsy specimens, are also consistent with BPP. The dense infiltration of the epidermis by numerous eosinophils, as seen in Figure 1B, is a characteristic feature of BPP. The abrupt necrosis of the epidermis and the intraepidermal blister filled with neutrophils and eosinophils, as seen in Figure 1C, are also consistent with BPP.

The other options are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's clinical presentation and histopathological findings:

A. Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis: This is a rare condition characterized by the development of multiple, confluent, and reticulated papillomatoses on the trunk and limbs. While the patient's reticular pattern of bullae may resemble the reticulated papillomatoses, the absence of any papillomatoses on the patient's skin and the presence of eosinophils in the biopsy specimen argue against this diagnosis.

C. Linear IgA bullous dermatosis: This is a rare autoimmune blistering disorder characterized by the deposition of IgA antibodies along the basement membrane zone. While the patient's bullous lesions may resemble those seen in

**Answer**:D. Determine Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) status and consider observation following cessation of methotrexate therapy.

The correct answer is D, "Determine Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) status and consider observation following cessation of methotrexate therapy," for the following reasons:

A. Initiate treatment with radiation and/or chemotherapy:
This option is not appropriate as the patient has already been diagnosed with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and has had a negative biopsy for CD5 and Bcl-1. Radiation and chemotherapy are not typically used to treat DLBCL, especially in cases where the patient has a negative biopsy for CD5 and Bcl-1.

B. Initiate treatment with rituximab:
This option is also not appropriate as rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets CD20, which is already positive in this patient's biopsy. The patient's DLBCL is unlikely to respond to rituximab alone, and it would not address the underlying cause of the lymphoma.

C. Excise the eyelid lesion:
This option is not appropriate as the patient's DLBCL has already spread beyond the eyelid, as evidenced by the magnetic resonance image (MRI) showing diffuse infiltration of the eyelid and lymphadenopathy. Excising the eyelid lesion would not address the systemic disease.

D. Determine Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) status and consider observation following cessation of methotrexate therapy:
This option is appropriate because EBV is a common viral association with DLBCL, and determining the patient's EBV status may help guide further management. Additionally, the patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis and long-term use of methotrexate may have contributed to the development of DLBCL. Discontinuing methotrexate therapy and closely monitoring the patient's condition may be a reasonable approach, given the patient's negative

The correct answer is C. Oral propranolol.

Propranolol is a beta-blocker that has been shown to reduce the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and other pro-angiogenic factors. In the case of Sturge-Weber syndrome, the use of propranolol has been suggested as a potential treatment for the associated choroidal effusion and exudative retinal detachment. By reducing the production of VEGF, propranolol may help to reduce the amount of fluid leakage from the choroidal vessels and promote reattachment of the retina.

In contrast, the other answer choices are not as appropriate for this case.

A. Drainage of the choroidal effusion: While drainage of the choroidal effusion may provide temporary relief of the hypotony and shallow anterior chamber, it does not address the underlying cause of the effusion, which is the abnormal angiogenesis associated with Sturge-Weber syndrome. In addition, drainage of the effusion may lead to a risk of infection, bleeding, or further damage to the eye.

B. Oral steroids: Steroids are commonly used to reduce inflammation and swelling in the eye, but they are not specifically effective in reducing choroidal effusion or exudative retinal detachment associated with Sturge-Weber syndrome. In addition, long-term use of steroids can have systemic side effects, such as weight gain, mood changes, and increased risk of infections.

D. Anti-VEGF therapy: While anti-VEGF therapy has been shown to be effective in reducing choroidal effusion and exudative retinal detachment in some cases, it is not specifically effective in Sturge-Weber syndrome. In addition, anti-VEGF therapy can be expensive and may require frequent injections, which can be a burden for patients and their families.

Therefore, oral propranolol is the most appropriate choice for this case, as it targets the underlying pathophysiology of Sturge-Weber syndrome and has

**Answer**: B. Incontinentia pigmenti

Incontinentia pigmenti (IP) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the skin and nervous system. It is characterized by the development of skin lesions, usually present at birth or appearing within the first few weeks of life, which are arranged in a linear or whorled pattern. The lesions are typically skin-colored or slightly darker than the surrounding skin and may be accompanied by other symptoms such as seizures, developmental delays, and vision problems.

The patient in the case presented with a linear band of skin-colored papules on his left upper extremity, as well as similar lesions on his left medial thigh in a whorled configuration. These lesions have been present since birth and have not resolved over time, which is consistent with the characteristic presentation of IP. Additionally, the patient's mother had a history of varicella (chickenpox) in childhood, which is a common feature in families with IP.

In contrast, varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is a highly contagious viral infection that causes chickenpox. While VZV can cause skin lesions, they are typically not present at birth and do not have the characteristic linear or whorled pattern seen in IP. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is another viral infection that can cause skin lesions, but these lesions are typically small, painful, and have a characteristic ulcerative or crusted appearance. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare disorder that affects the immune system and can cause skin lesions, but these lesions are typically larger and have a characteristic "sandpaper" texture.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and medical history, the most likely diagnosis is incontinentia pigmenti.

**Answer**: C. Small-bowel volvulus

The correct answer is C. Small-bowel volvulus because it matches the patient's symptoms and the abdominal CT scan findings.

A. Intussusception is an incorrect choice because it is a condition where a portion of the intestine slides into another, causing a bowel obstruction. While it can cause abdominal pain and vomiting, it is not typically associated with a mass on the right side of the paraumbilical point.

B. Colon cancer is an incorrect choice because it is a malignancy that affects the colon, and it does not explain the patient's symptoms of vomiting and abdominal pain that started 24 hours earlier. Also, the CT scan findings do not suggest a colon cancer.

D. Mesenteric ischemia is an incorrect choice because it is a condition where the blood supply to the intestines is reduced, leading to abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. However, it does not explain the mass on the right side of the paraumbilical point.

Small-bowel volvulus, on the other hand, is a condition where the small intestine twists around itself, causing an obstruction. It can cause abdominal pain, vomiting, and a mass in the abdomen. The patient's symptoms of vomiting and abdominal pain that started 24 hours earlier, along with the CT scan findings of a mass on the right side of the paraumbilical point, are consistent with small-bowel volvulus. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

**Answer**: D. Right thoracotomy with primary closure and mesh placement

The correct answer is D, Right thoracotomy with primary closure and mesh placement, because it is the most appropriate surgical approach for repairing a large hernia defect, such as the one described in the case.

A, Video-assisted thoracic surgery reduction, is not the best choice because it is a minimally invasive approach that may not provide adequate exposure for repairing a large hernia defect. Additionally, it may not allow for adequate mobilization of the herniated contents.

B, Transabdominal laparoscopic reduction and mesh placement, is also not the best choice because it is a laparoscopic approach that may not provide adequate visualization and exposure for repairing a large hernia defect. Moreover, it may not allow for adequate mobilization of the herniated contents.

C, Video-assisted thoracic surgery reduction with primary closure, is not the best choice because it does not allow for mesh placement, which is recommended for large hernia defects to prevent recurrence.

Therefore, D, Right thoracotomy with primary closure and mesh placement, is the best choice for repairing a large hernia defect, as it provides adequate exposure, allows for mobilization of the herniated contents, and allows for mesh placement to prevent recurrence.

**Answer**:B. Endothelial adrenal cyst

The correct answer is B. Endothelial adrenal cyst because it is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.

A. Serous cystadenoma of the pancreas is an unlikely diagnosis because it is a benign tumor that typically occurs in the pancreas, and the patient's symptoms and imaging findings do not suggest a pancreatic mass.

C. Retroperitoneal abscess is an unlikely diagnosis because the patient does not have any signs of infection, such as fever or leukocytosis, and the imaging findings do not suggest an abscess.

D. Pheochromocytoma is an unlikely diagnosis because it is a rare tumor that typically occurs in the adrenal gland and the patient's symptoms and imaging findings do not suggest an adrenal mass.

The patient's symptoms of intermittent left upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, and constipation, along with the imaging findings of a 13-cm retroperitoneal mass with significant mass effect, are more consistent with an endothelial adrenal cyst. Endothelial adrenal cysts are rare, benign tumors that occur in the adrenal gland and can cause symptoms due to their size and location. The patient's history of chronic hepatitis B and recent liver biopsy also support the diagnosis of an endothelial adrenal cyst, as these patients are at increased risk of developing rare tumors. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

**Answer**: A. Consult a neurosurgeon to evaluate the brain CT finding; obtain a CT scan of the lung and abdomen and offer genetic counseling for the patient and her family.

The correct answer is A because the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a possible diagnosis of a vasculitis, such as polyarteritis nodosa (PAN). PAN is a systemic inflammatory disease that affects the small and medium-sized blood vessels, leading to damage of various organs, including the brain, lung, and skin. The red papules on the tongue and trunk are consistent with this diagnosis.

It is important to consult a neurosurgeon to evaluate the brain CT finding, as the ring-enhanced lesion with surrounding edema on the left frontoparietal lobe may indicate a neurological complication of PAN, such as a cerebral aneurysm or arteritis. Additionally, obtaining a CT scan of the lung and abdomen can help identify any other organ involvement, such as pulmonary nodules or abdominal vasculitis. Offering genetic counseling for the patient and her family is also appropriate, as PAN can be associated with certain genetic mutations.

Choice B is incorrect because while a dermatology consultation may be helpful in managing the skin lesions, it does not address the underlying systemic condition that is causing the patient's symptoms. Interventional radiology may also not be necessary at this point in the patient's management.

Choice C is incorrect because while continuing intravenous antibiotics may be appropriate for managing any potential infection, it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

Choice D is incorrect because obtaining a biopsy of the tongue lesions may not provide a definitive diagnosis and may not be necessary given the patient's other symptoms and physical examination findings.

Let's go through each answer choice and explain why it's incorrect:

A. The patient has hepatic encephalopathy and should be treated.

This answer is incorrect because the patient's serum ammonia level is within the normal range (20-40 μg/dL), and there is no evidence of cognitive impairment or other symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy.

B. The patient has subclinical hepatic encephalopathy and should be treated.

This answer is incorrect because there is no evidence of subclinical hepatic encephalopathy. The patient's serum ammonia level is normal, and there are no symptoms or signs of encephalopathy.

C. The patient is at high risk for developing hepatic encephalopathy and should be prophylactically treated.

This answer is incorrect because the patient's serum ammonia level is normal, and there are no other risk factors for hepatic encephalopathy mentioned in the case.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. The patient does not have hepatic encephalopathy so no treatment is necessary.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is D. Start systemic immunosuppressive therapy.

The patient's symptoms of a malar rash, fever, muscle pain, and weakness, along with the physical examination findings of well-demarcated erythematous to violaceous scaly plaques on the forehead and cheeks, diffuse areas of reticulated hyperpigmentation on the chest, and violaceous, thin, flat-topped papules bilaterally on the dorsal surfaces of the hands, are consistent with a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The patient's history of myelofibrosis and allogeneic peripheral hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a single-antigen mismatched unrelated donor, as well as the use of a busulfan-based myeloablative regimen for preconditioning, increase the likelihood of this diagnosis.

Option A, ordering anti-dsDNA, anti-Smith, and antihistone antibody tests, may be useful in confirming the diagnosis of SLE, but it is not the most appropriate next step. While these tests can help support the diagnosis, they are not definitive and may not be positive in all cases of SLE. Moreover, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are already consistent with SLE, making these tests less necessary at this point.

Option B, obtaining a skin punch biopsy to confirm the diagnosis, may also be useful in confirming the diagnosis of SLE, but it is not the most appropriate next step. While a skin biopsy can provide valuable information, it may not be necessary in this case given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, which are already consistent with SLE. Additionally, a skin biopsy may not be able to differentiate between SLE and other skin conditions.

Option C, starting high-potency topical steroid, topical calcineurin inhibitor, or both, may be appropriate for managing the patient's skin symptoms, but it is not the most appropriate next step. While topical therapies can be effective in managing skin symptoms, they may

The correct answer is D. Perform orbitotomy with biopsy.

Orbitotomy is a surgical procedure that involves making an incision into the orbit to access the mass and remove it. Biopsy is the process of removing a small sample of tissue from the mass for further examination. In this case, the patient's symptoms of left forehead numbness and intermittent left eyelid edema, along with the physical examination findings of decreased sensation in the distribution of the ophthalmic branch of the left trigeminal nerve, a palpable mass at the left supratrochlear notch, proptosis, and inferior globe dystopia, suggest that the mass is likely to be a tumor.

The MRI scan also supports this diagnosis, as it shows an infiltrating superomedial mass involving the extraconal and intraconal space on the left side. Therefore, the next step would be to perform a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and determine the nature of the tumor.

Option A, observe, is not appropriate because the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest that the mass is likely to be a tumor that requires prompt treatment.

Option B, administer empirical corticosteroid treatment, may be considered for cases of suspected inflammatory orbital pseudotumor, but it is not appropriate for a confirmed tumor. Corticosteroids may reduce inflammation, but they will not remove the tumor.

Option C, perform external beam radiotherapy, may be considered for cases of malignant orbital tumors, but it is not appropriate for a benign tumor. Radiotherapy may be considered after biopsy confirms the diagnosis of a malignant tumor.

Therefore, the best answer is D. Perform orbitotomy with biopsy.

**Answer**: A. Observe

The correct answer is A. Observe because the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a diagnosis of retinal migraine, which is a benign condition that does not require immediate treatment. The patient's blurry vision and shimmering lights are consistent with the scintillating scotoma that is typical of retinal migraine. The presence of small yellow-white retinal lesions on the fundus examination also supports this diagnosis.

The other answer choices are not appropriate for several reasons:

B. Treat with oral corticosteroids: Corticosteroids are not indicated for retinal migraine, as it is not an inflammatory condition.

C. Treat with topical corticosteroids: Topical corticosteroids are also not indicated for retinal migraine, as the condition does not involve the anterior segment of the eye.

D. Treat with intravitreal antibiotics: Intravitreal antibiotics are not indicated for retinal migraine, as it is not an infectious condition.

Therefore, the best course of action is to observe the patient and monitor their symptoms, as retinal migraine is generally a self-limiting condition that resolves on its own within a few minutes to hours.

**Answer**: C. Coccidioidomycosis

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis, a fungal infection caused by Coccidioides immitis. The patient's recent travel history and residence in Los Angeles, California, increase the likelihood of this diagnosis, as coccidioidomycosis is endemic in the southwestern United States. The patient's symptoms, including bilateral cervical adenopathy and a history of pneumonia, are consistent with coccidioidomycosis. The laboratory results, including a normal white blood cell count and a negative Mantoux tuberculin skin test, also support this diagnosis.

The chest radiograph showing bilateral hilar adenopathy is consistent with coccidioidomycosis, as the fungus can cause granulomas in the lungs. The histological examination of the excised lymph node showing multiple spherules containing endospores (arrowheads) is diagnostic of coccidioidomycosis.

The other answer choices are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and laboratory results:

A. Tuberculosis: Although the patient's symptoms and laboratory results could be consistent with tuberculosis, the negative Mantoux tuberculin skin test and the absence of other signs of tuberculosis, such as fever, night sweats, and weight loss, make this diagnosis less likely.

B. Nontuberculous mycobacterial infection: Nontuberculous mycobacterial infections can cause cervical adenopathy and other symptoms similar to those seen in coccidioidomycosis. However, the patient's recent travel history and residence in Los Angeles, California, make coccidioidomycosis more likely.

D. Lymphoma: Lymphoma can cause cervical adenopathy and other symptoms similar to those seen in coccidioidomycosis. However, the patient's age and laboratory results do not support this diagnosis. Lymphoma is more common in older adults, and patients with lym

The correct answer is C. Splenic lymphangiomatosis because it matches the patient's symptoms and test results. Splenic lymphangiomatosis is a rare condition where the spleen is enlarged due to an abnormal growth of lymph vessels. This matches the patient's physical examination findings of a large, soft spleen that extends below the costal margin. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, early satiety, and back pain are also consistent with this diagnosis.

The other answer choices do not match the patient's symptoms and test results:

A. Splenic pelosis: This is a rare condition where the spleen is enlarged due to an accumulation of red blood cells. It does not match the patient's symptoms of fatigue, early satiety, and back pain.

B. Echinococcal splenic cystic disease: This is a parasitic infection that causes cysts to form in the spleen. It does not match the patient's symptoms of fatigue, early satiety, and back pain, and there is no mention of a parasitic infection in the patient's history.

D. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma: This is a type of cancer that affects the immune system. It does not match the patient's symptoms of fatigue, early satiety, and back pain, and there is no mention of any constitutional symptoms such as fevers, night sweats, chills, arthralgias, or weight loss that are commonly seen in patients with Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.

**Answer**: C. Catheterization of left anomalous pulmonary vein

The given answer, C, is the correct diagnosis because the catheter tip is located in an anomalous pulmonary vein, which is not the expected location for a central venous catheter. The patient's medical history, including a previous episode of native aortic valve endocarditis and the current diagnosis of MRSA prosthetic valve endocarditis, suggests that the catheter was placed in the left internal jugular vein for dialysis and antibiotic administration. However, the post-procedure radiograph showed that the catheter tip was not in the expected location, which led to the incorrect placement diagnosis.

Option A, catheterization of the left pericardiacophrenic vein, is incorrect because the catheter tip is not located in the pericardiacophrenic vein, which is a small vein that drains blood from the pericardial sac surrounding the heart.

Option B, catheterization of the left internal thoracic vein, is also incorrect because the catheter tip is not located in the internal thoracic vein, which is a tributary of the brachiocephalic vein that drains blood from the mediastinum.

Option D, catheterization of the left superior intercostal vein, is incorrect because the catheter tip is not located in the superior intercostal vein, which is a small vein that drains blood from the upper lobe of the lung.

Therefore, the correct diagnosis is C, catheterization of the left anomalous pulmonary vein, which is a rare condition where a pulmonary vein drains into the systemic circulation instead of the pulmonary circulation.

**Answer**: D. Prescribe oral prednisone and HSV viral suppression therapy

Explanation:
The correct answer is D, Prescribe oral prednisone and HSV viral suppression therapy, for the following reasons:

* Oral prednisone is a corticosteroid that can help reduce inflammation and suppress the immune system, which can help manage symptoms of erythema multiforme.
* HSV viral suppression therapy, such as valacyclovir, can help reduce the severity and frequency of herpes simplex virus (HSV) outbreaks, which may be contributing to the patient's skin lesions.
* The patient's history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and positive HSV IgG serologic testing suggest that she may be at risk for HSV reactivation, which can trigger erythema multiforme.
* The patient's oral lesions are consistent with herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, and HSV viral suppression therapy can help manage these lesions.
* The patient's menstrual cycle may also be a contributing factor to the recurrence of her skin lesions, and HSV viral suppression therapy may help reduce the severity of symptoms during this time.

The other choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Check serum cryoglobulin level: While cryoglobulinemia can cause cutaneous lesions similar to erythema multiforme, it is not typically associated with HSV infection. Therefore, checking serum cryoglobulin level would not be the most appropriate next step.
* B. Administer intradermal progesterone challenge: Intradermal progesterone challenge is not a standard diagnostic test for erythema multiforme, and it would not address the patient's HSV infection or menstrual cycle-related symptoms.
* C. Prescribe interferon, ribavirin, and telaprevir: These medications are typically used to treat hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, but they are not directly related to the management of erythema multiforme or HSV infection.

The correct answer is D. Obtain a biopsy of the lesion for pathological examination.

A biopsy is necessary to establish the diagnosis of the erosive plaque on the scrotum. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with several possible conditions, including squamous cell carcinoma, psoriasis, and eczema. A biopsy will allow for a definitive diagnosis and guide further management.

Empiric treatment with a topical steroid (choice A) may not be effective for all possible diagnoses and may even mask the diagnosis, making it more difficult to determine the appropriate treatment.

Initiating treatment with valacyclovir and sending a culture for further studies (choice B) is not appropriate because the patient does not have symptoms consistent with herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection, and there is no indication for antiviral therapy. Additionally, valacyclovir would not be effective against other potential causes of the erosive plaque.

Ordering laboratory studies to rule out syphilis (choice C) may be appropriate, but it is not the most appropriate next step. Syphilis is a possible diagnosis, but it is not the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

The correct answer is C: Primary aldosteronism is suggested; confirmation requires an aldosterone suppression test.

Let's go through each answer choice and explain why it's incorrect or correct:

A: Primary aldosteronism is confirmed.

This answer choice is incorrect because while the patient's high aldosterone-to-renin ratio (ARR) suggests primary aldosteronism, confirmation requires additional testing. The patient's history of hypertension and diabetes also increases the likelihood of secondary hypertension, making it essential to rule out other potential causes before confirming the diagnosis.

B: Primary aldosteronism is suggested; imaging is required for confirmation.

This answer choice is incorrect because while imaging studies like CT or MRI may be useful in identifying an aldosterone-producing adenoma or carcinoma, they are not the next step in confirming primary aldosteronism. Instead, an aldosterone suppression test is typically performed to confirm the diagnosis.

D: The results are unreliable; ARR should be measured 1 month after discontinuing lisinopril.

This answer choice is incorrect because the patient's recent medication history, including lisinopril and verapamil, may affect renin activity but not necessarily aldosterone production. Discontinuing lisinopril would not significantly impact the ARR results, and waiting 1 month to measure ARR would not be necessary.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: Primary aldosteronism is suggested; confirmation requires an aldosterone suppression test. This answer choice accurately reflects the patient's situation and the necessary steps to confirm the diagnosis.

**Answer**:B. Fluorescein angiography (FA)

The patient's symptoms of transient blurred vision, along with the physical examination findings of normal visual acuity, pupils, intraocular pressure, motility, and confrontational visual fields, suggest a possible diagnosis of retinal vasculitis or occlusive vasculitis. Fluorescein angiography (FA) is the appropriate next step in the diagnostic workup. FA is a non-invasive imaging technique that uses a fluorescent dye to visualize the retinal blood vessels and assess their circulation. It can help identify areas of vascular leakage or obstruction, which can aid in the diagnosis of retinal vasculitis or occlusive vasculitis.

Option A, screening for autoantibodies, may be relevant in the context of a neurological disorder, but it is not directly related to the patient's ophthalmic symptoms or physical examination findings.

Option C, repeat lumbar puncture, may be necessary if the initial lumbar puncture did not provide enough information or if there is a concern about a treatable cause of the patient's neurological symptoms. However, it is not the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic workup given the patient's ophthalmic symptoms and normal cerebrospinal fluid analysis results.

Option D, carotid ultrasonography, is not directly related to the patient's symptoms or physical examination findings. While it may be appropriate in the context of a neurological disorder, it is not the most relevant next step in the diagnostic workup for the patient's ophthalmic symptoms.

**Answer**:C. Perform magnetic resonance imaging

The patient's symptoms of photopsias, blurry vision, and decreased peripheral vision, along with the physical examination findings of red desaturation and decreased color vision, suggest a possible diagnosis of optic neuritis. Optic neuritis is inflammation of the optic nerve that can occur due to various causes, including multiple sclerosis. The patient's history of MS and previous episodes of optic neuritis in both eyes increase the likelihood of this diagnosis.

The correct answer, C. Perform magnetic resonance imaging, is the next step in the diagnostic workup of the patient. MRI can help to confirm the diagnosis of optic neuritis by identifying inflammation or demyelination in the optic nerve. Additionally, MRI can help to rule out other causes of vision loss, such as a tumor or stroke.

Option A, Observe the patient, is not a sufficient next step in the diagnostic workup of the patient. While observation may be appropriate for some patients with stable vision, the patient's symptoms of photopsias and blurry vision suggest a more urgent need for further evaluation.

Option B, Start steroid therapy, may be appropriate for patients with acute optic neuritis, but it is not the next step in the diagnostic workup. Steroids are used to reduce inflammation and speed up recovery, but they do not address the underlying cause of the condition.

Option D, Order serum titers of IgM and IgG for Bartonella henselae, is not relevant to the patient's symptoms or medical history. Bartonella henselae is a bacterium that can cause cat scratch disease, which can lead to optic neuritis in some cases. However, there is no indication in the patient's history or physical examination to suggest that this is the cause of her symptoms.

**Answer**:C. Idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome 

The patient's symptoms, such as eyelid swelling, redness, pain, blurred vision, and limited ocular movements, are consistent with orbital inflammation. The fact that the patient has had three hospitalizations for similar symptoms, with no symptoms in the intervals, suggests a chronic and recurrent condition.

Idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome (IOIS) is a rare condition characterized by recurrent episodes of orbital inflammation, without an identifiable cause. It is often associated with symptoms similar to those described in the patient's history. The patient's age and the absence of any identifiable cause for the symptoms also support this diagnosis.

Orbital cellulitis (choice A) is an infection of the orbit that can cause similar symptoms, but it is typically associated with a history of trauma, sinusitis, or insect bites, which is not mentioned in the patient's history. Additionally, the patient's symptoms have been recurrent, which is less consistent with orbital cellulitis.

Rhabdomyosarcoma of the extraocular muscles (choice B) is a rare type of cancer that can cause proptosis, chemosis, and limited ocular movements. However, the patient's age and the absence of any other signs of cancer, such as a mass or painless vision loss, make this diagnosis less likely.

Thyroid ophthalmopathy (choice D) is a condition associated with Graves' disease, which can cause proptosis, chemosis, and limited ocular movements. However, the patient's history does not suggest any thyroid dysfunction, and the absence of any other signs of Graves' disease, such as exophthalmos or lid retraction, makes this diagnosis less likely.

Therefore, based on the patient's history and symptoms, the most likely diagnosis is idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome (choice C).

The correct answer is D. Appendiceal intussusception.

Intussusception is a condition where a portion of the intestine slides into another portion, causing a blockage. In this case, the patient presented with lower abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, which are common symptoms of intussusception. The fact that the patient had a mass palpable in the lower right abdominal quadrant and that the abdominal ultrasonographic examination and computed tomography were suggestive of an ileal intussusception, further supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the presence of a bulge in the cecal lumen, as revealed by colonoscopy, is also consistent with appendiceal intussusception.

Now, let's discuss why the other answer choices are incorrect:

A. Appendiceal abscess: An appendiceal abscess is a collection of pus in the appendix, which can cause abdominal pain and other symptoms. However, the patient's symptoms and examination findings do not suggest an abscess. The absence of fever and the presence of a mass in the lower right abdominal quadrant make appendiceal abscess less likely.

B. Ileal intussusception: As mentioned earlier, the patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with intussusception. However, the location of the mass palpable in the lower right abdominal quadrant and the findings of the imaging studies suggest that the intussusception is located in the appendix, rather than the ileum.

C. Cecal volvulus: A cecal volvulus occurs when the cecum twists, causing a blockage. This can cause abdominal pain and other symptoms. However, the patient's symptoms and examination findings do not suggest a cecal volvulus. The presence of a bulge in the cecal lumen, as revealed by colonoscopy, is not consistent with a volvulus.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Appendiceal intussusception.

**Answer**: D. Pseudosarcomatous fibromyxoid tumor

The correct answer is D. Pseudosarcomatous fibromyxoid tumor because it best fits the patient's symptoms and test results.

A. Recurrent prostatic carcinoma is unlikely because the patient's prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level is undetectable, which suggests that the prostate cancer has been successfully treated. Additionally, the imaging findings of a heterogeneously enhancing mass within the prostatic bed with central necrosis do not typical of recurrent prostate cancer.

B. Neurofibroma is not a likely diagnosis because the patient does not have a history of neurofibromatosis 1, and the imaging findings do not suggest a typical neurofibroma.

C. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST) is a possible diagnosis, but it is less likely than pseudosarcomatous fibromyxoid tumor (PSFMT) due to the following reasons:

1. MPNST typically affects patients with a history of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), which the patient does not have.
2. MPNSTs are usually associated with a higher mitotic index than PSFMTs.
3. MPNSTs are more likely to have a nodular or diffuse pattern of growth, whereas PSFMTs tend to have a more circumscribed margin.
4. The negative staining result for CD34 and CDK4 and the absence of MDM2 gene amplification, as seen in this case, are less common in MPNSTs than in PSFMTs.

D. Pseudosarcomatous fibromyxoid tumor (PSFMT) is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and test results. PSFMTs are rare soft tissue tumors that can arise in various parts of the body, including the prostate. They are characterized by a combination of spindle cells with a low mitotic index, prominent vasculature, and a fibromyxoid stroma.

**Answer**:B. Fungal mycetoma

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, as well as the imaging results, are consistent with a diagnosis of fungal mycetoma. The patient's complaints of a growing mass, spontaneous drainage of pus, and unexplained weight loss are typical symptoms of fungal mycetoma. The physical examination findings of a large palpable mass with central fluctuance and surrounding erythema, as well as the presence of multiple pustules, are also consistent with this diagnosis.

The imaging results, which showed a large soft-tissue mass in the right lateral abdominal wall that appeared to directly invade the liver and extend through intercostal spaces with multiple small areas of calcification, are also consistent with a diagnosis of fungal mycetoma. The fact that the patient had no recent travel history and that the mass had been present for 4 weeks, which is a relatively long period of time for a bacterial abscess to form, also support this diagnosis.

Malignant sarcoma (choice A) is an unlikely diagnosis because the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest a malignant process, and the imaging results do not show any features that are typical of a malignant tumor. Giant infiltrating lipoma (choice C) is also an unlikely diagnosis because it is a rare condition that typically presents with a slow-growing mass and does not have the same imaging features as fungal mycetoma. Bacterial abscess (choice D) is a possible diagnosis, but it is less likely than fungal mycetoma given the patient's symptoms and imaging results.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and imaging results, the most likely diagnosis is fungal mycetoma.

**Answer**: D. This patient is infected with the most common strain of HCV in the United States and it has lower response rates to interferon-based therapy.

The correct answer is D because the patient's test results indicate that they are infected with HCV, specifically the most common strain in the United States, which is genotype 1. The patient's low viral load and absence of liver damage suggest that they may have a better response to treatment. However, genotype 1 has been shown to have lower response rates to interferon-based therapy compared to other genotypes. Therefore, choice D is the best answer.

 Choice A is incorrect because the patient's low viral load does not necessarily mean they have a low viral load, as the test results do not indicate the viral load.

 Choice B is incorrect because the patient's positive anti-HCV test result indicates that they are infected with HCV, and the absence of liver damage does not necessarily mean they are no longer infected.

 Choice C is incorrect because the patient's normal aminotransferase levels do not rule out liver damage, as HCV can cause liver damage without elevating these enzymes. Additionally, the patient's mild increased echogenicity of the liver suggests that there may be some liver damage present.

The correct answer is B. Obtain a computed tomography scan of the chest.

A. Perform a bronchoscopy and obtain bronchoalveolar lavage for culture and sensitivity: While bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage can be useful in diagnosing lung infections, it may not be the most appropriate step in this case. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a possible lung lesion or mass, which would not be easily diagnosed by bronchoscopy. Additionally, bronchoscopy may not be able to provide a definitive diagnosis for the patient's symptoms.

C. Perform an infectious workup including a complete blood cell count, blood culture, sputum culture, and purified protein derivative test to rule out pulmonary tuberculosis: While it is important to rule out pulmonary tuberculosis, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a possible lung lesion or mass, which would not be diagnosed by an infectious workup. Additionally, the patient's history of intermittent left shoulder and left-sided chest pain for 4 months following a dance recital suggests a chronic condition rather than an acute infection.

D. Treat with oral antibiotics: Oral antibiotics may be appropriate if the patient is diagnosed with a bacterial infection, but it is not the most appropriate step in this case. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a possible lung lesion or mass, which would not be treated with antibiotics. Additionally, antibiotics may not be effective in treating the patient's symptoms if the underlying cause is not an infection.

Therefore, the most appropriate step would be to obtain a computed tomography scan of the chest to further evaluate the patient's lung lesion or mass and determine the appropriate course of action.

**Answer**: C. Perform a punch biopsy of the lesion

The correct answer is C, Perform a punch biopsy of the lesion, because it is the most appropriate next step in the evaluation of this patient's hyperpigmented lesion. A punch biopsy would allow for a histopathological examination of the lesion, which would help to determine the cause of the lesion and guide further management.

The other answer choices are not as appropriate for the following reasons:

A. Obtain a radiograph of the lower leg: While a radiograph may be useful in some cases of skin lesions, it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a cutaneous lesion, and a radiograph is unlikely to provide useful information.

B. Obtain antinuclear antibody levels: Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) are commonly used to diagnose autoimmune diseases, but they are not typically ordered in the evaluation of a skin lesion. The patient's history of type 2 diabetes mellitus and the physical examination findings do not suggest an autoimmune disorder.

D. Obtain blood cultures and prescribe empirical antibiotics: Blood cultures and antibiotics are not necessary at this stage of the evaluation. The patient does not have signs of systemic infection, such as fevers or chills, and the lesion does not appear to be infected. Empirical antibiotics should only be prescribed when there is a clear indication for them, such as in the presence of signs of infection or sepsis.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in the evaluation of this patient's hyperpigmented lesion is to perform a punch biopsy. This will allow for a histopathological examination of the lesion, which will help to determine the cause of the lesion and guide further management.

**Answer**: D. Obtain a surgical consultation for splenectomy

The patient's presentation of progressive anemia and left upper quadrant pain, along with the history of polycythemia vera and a documented splenic hemangioma, suggests the possibility of a splenic malignancy. The patient's recent weight loss and fatigue also support this possibility.

Option A, managing conservatively with transfusions, fluids, and analgesics, may provide temporary relief for the patient's symptoms, but it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's anemia and pain.

Option B, obtaining a bone marrow biopsy, may be useful in diagnosing a hematological malignancy, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as the patient's history and physical examination findings suggest a splenic malignancy rather than a bone marrow malignancy.

Option C, obtaining an urgent upper endoscopy, may be useful in diagnosing and managing gastrointestinal bleeding, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest gastrointestinal bleeding.

Therefore, the correct answer is option D, obtaining a surgical consultation for splenectomy. This is the most appropriate next step in the patient's management, as it allows for the evaluation and potential removal of the splenic malignancy, which is the likely cause of the patient's symptoms and anemia.

**Answer**: B. Place bandage contact lenses

The patient in this case has a paracentral neurotrophic ulcer with anterior uveitis and a hypopyon in the right eye, as well as a persistent epithelial defect and reactive anterior chamber uveitis with a hypopyon in the left eye. These findings suggest that the patient has a severe case of dry eye syndrome, which is likely causing the corneal ulcers and uveitis.

Bandage contact lenses are a common treatment for corneal ulcers, as they provide a protective barrier that allows the cornea to heal. They also help to reduce pain and discomfort, and can help to prevent further irritation or damage to the cornea. In this case, placing bandage contact lenses on both eyes would help to protect the corneas and allow them to heal, which would address the patient's primary complaint of blurry vision.

The other answer choices are not as appropriate for several reasons:

A. Prescribe oral prednisone: While oral prednisone can be used to treat inflammation, it is not the most appropriate treatment for corneal ulcers and uveitis caused by dry eye syndrome. Topical corticosteroids are more commonly used to treat ocular inflammation, and oral prednisone may have more side effects than necessary for this condition.

C. Perform tarsorrhaphy: Tarsorrhaphy is a surgical procedure that involves sewing the eyelids shut to protect the cornea. While this procedure may be necessary in some cases of severe dry eye syndrome, it is not the most appropriate treatment for this patient's condition. The patient's symptoms and findings suggest that a less invasive treatment, such as bandage contact lenses, would be more appropriate.

D. Prescribe lubrication with autologous serum tears: While lubrication with autologous serum tears may be a helpful adjunctive treatment for dry eye syndrome, it is not the most appropriate treatment for corneal ulcers and uveitis. The patient's corneal ulcers and uveitis are likely caused by a more severe case of dry eye syndrome,

**Answer**: D. Surgical removal of the cyst and pathological analysis

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and ophthalmologic examination findings suggest a possible cyst in the right eye. The lesion's unique appearance, mobility, and lack of other symptoms support this diagnosis. A dilated fundus examination did not reveal any abnormalities, making it unlikely that the lesion is a result of a systemic disease.

Option A, a computerized tomographic scan, may be useful in identifying the extent of the lesion and any potential adhesions, but it is not the most appropriate next step.

Option B, anterior segment tomography with Pentacam, may provide additional information about the lesion's size, shape, and location, but it is not necessary at this point.

Option C, beginning systemic treatment with albendazole, is not indicated as there is no evidence of a parasitic infection.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to surgically remove the cyst and perform a pathological analysis to determine the nature of the lesion and rule out any potential malignancy. This approach will provide a definitive diagnosis and allow for appropriate treatment.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain why C. Lyme disease is the correct answer and why the other choices are incorrect.

**Answer**: C. Lyme disease

Lyme disease is a tick-borne illness caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi. It is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis). The symptoms of Lyme disease can vary depending on the stage of the infection. In the early stages, people may experience flu-like symptoms, such as fever, chills, and joint pain. They may also develop a distinctive rash, known as erythema migrans, which is a circular, red rash that can grow up to 12 inches in diameter.

In this case, the patient presented with pink-violaceous patches on her lower back, buttocks, and thighs. The patches were nummular and annular, meaning they were circular or ring-shaped. The distribution of the rash on the patient's body, particularly on the buttocks and thighs, is consistent with the spread of a tick-borne illness like Lyme disease. Additionally, the patient's history of Crohn disease and the recent onset of symptoms, such as fever and headache, suggest that she may have a concurrent infection.

It's worth noting that Lyme disease is relatively rare in children, especially in areas where the disease is not endemic. However, given the patient's exposure to ticks and the presence of a rash consistent with erythema migrans, Lyme disease should be considered as a possible diagnosis.

Now, let's discuss why the other choices are incorrect:

A. Fixed drug eruption: A fixed drug eruption is a type of adverse drug reaction that occurs when a person takes a medication and develops a distinctive rash or lesion at the same location every time they take the drug. This condition is not consistent with the patient's history of Crohn disease or the recent onset of symptoms.

**Answer**: C. Angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia

The correct answer is C. Angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia because it matches the given symptoms and test results.

A. Carcinoid tumor: A carcinoid tumor is a type of neuroendocrine tumor that can occur in various parts of the body, including the digestive system. However, it is unlikely to cause the symptoms described in the case, such as upper abdominal pain, nausea, and gastroesophageal reflux. Additionally, the imaging results do not suggest a carcinoid tumor, as they show a hypervascular soft tissue mass rather than a typical carcinoid tumor with a characteristic "salt and pepper" appearance on CT scan.

B. Desmoid tumor: A desmoid tumor is a type of benign connective tissue tumor that can occur in the abdominal wall or mesentery. However, it is unlikely to cause the symptoms described in the case, such as upper abdominal pain, nausea, and gastroesophageal reflux. Additionally, the imaging results do not suggest a desmoid tumor, as they show a hypervascular soft tissue mass rather than a typical desmoid tumor with a homogeneous, well-circumscribed appearance on CT scan.

D. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST): A GIST is a type of mesenchymal tumor that can occur in the digestive system. However, it is unlikely to cause the symptoms described in the case, such as upper abdominal pain, nausea, and gastroesophageal reflux. Additionally, the imaging results do not suggest a GIST, as they show a hypervascular soft tissue mass rather than a typical GIST with a characteristic "spotted" appearance on CT scan.

Sure, I'd be happy to explain.

The correct answer is C: Avulsed uterine fibroid.

A: Duodenal injury is an incorrect choice because while the patient does have abdominal pain and tenderness, there is no evidence of a seatbelt sign or peritonitis, which would suggest a duodenal injury. Additionally, the patient's history of asthma and the absence of any other symptoms or signs of a duodenal injury make it less likely.

B: Mesenteric hematoma is also an incorrect choice. While the patient does have a large amount of free fluid throughout the abdomen and pelvis, the focal density consistent with a hematoma in the left midabdomen suggests a different type of bleeding. Additionally, the patient's vital signs, particularly her blood pressure and heart rate, do not suggest a severe bleeding that would be consistent with a mesenteric hematoma.

D: Right gonadal vein injury is an unlikely choice because the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest a right gonadal vein injury. The irregularity of the right gonadal vein seen on the CT scan is likely due to the patient's positioning during the scan rather than an injury.

C: Avulsed uterine fibroid is the correct choice because it explains the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, including her diffuse lower abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, as well as the irregularity of the right gonadal vein seen on the CT scan. The patient's age and medical history of asthma also increase her risk for uterine fibroids. The presence of a heterogeneous and bulky uterus on the CT scan further supports this diagnosis.

**Answer**: B. Ileocolic intussusception

The correct answer is B. Ileocolic intussusception because it matches the patient's symptoms and imaging results.

Intussusception is a condition where a portion of the intestine slides into another portion, causing a blockage. In this case, the patient had a history of recurrent small-bowel obstruction, which is consistent with intussusception. The imaging results showed a characteristic "target sign" or "bull's eye" appearance, which is indicative of intussusception.

The other answer choices do not match the patient's symptoms or imaging results:

A. Colorectal carcinoid tumor: This is a type of cancer that affects the colon or rectum. While it can cause abdominal pain and other symptoms, it does not explain the patient's history of recurrent small-bowel obstruction or the imaging results.

C. Cecal volvulus: This is a condition where the cecum twists, causing a blockage. However, the patient's imaging results did not show any twisting or abnormality in the cecum, making this diagnosis less likely.

D. Metastatic carcinomatosis: This is a condition where cancer spreads to other parts of the body. While it can cause abdominal pain and other symptoms, it does not explain the patient's history of recurrent small-bowel obstruction or the imaging results.

Therefore, B. Ileocolic intussusception is the most likely diagnosis for the patient's symptoms and imaging results.

**Answer**: C. Order observation and cardiac monitoring

Explanation:
The correct answer is C. Order observation and cardiac monitoring, as it is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient.

The patient presents with severe lactic acidosis, which can be a life-threatening condition. The presence of a scalp hematoma and trismus suggests that the patient may have suffered a head injury, which could be the cause of the lactic acidosis. The patient's left leg is also swollen and warm, with bullae on the dorsum of the first and second toes, suggesting possible cellulitis or soft tissue injury.

Given these findings, it is important to closely monitor the patient's vital signs, particularly his heart rate and blood pressure, as lactic acidosis can cause cardiovascular instability. The patient's tachycardia and tachypnea suggest that he is already experiencing some degree of cardiovascular compromise. Therefore, choice C, Order observation and cardiac monitoring, is the most appropriate next step.

Choice A, Obtain imaging of the left leg, may be appropriate later in the patient's management, but it is not the most urgent step. The patient's leg swelling and bullae may indicate a soft tissue infection, but it is not immediately life-threatening.

Choice B, Order intravenous antibiotics, may also be appropriate later in the patient's management, but it is not the most urgent step. While the patient's symptoms suggest a possible infection, it is important to first determine the cause of the lactic acidosis and ensure that the patient is stable before initiating antibiotics.

Choice D, Perform an extended drug screen, is not relevant to the patient's current condition. There is no evidence to suggest that the patient has ingested any drugs or toxins, and this test would not provide any useful information in the immediate management of the patient.

**Answer**:A. The patient is in congestive heart failure and needs a loop diuretic.

The patient presents with symptoms of congestive heart failure (CHF), including paroxysmal tachycardia, diminished breath sounds in the bibasilar lung fields, and pulmonary edema revealed by portable chest x-ray. These signs indicate that the patient's heart is not pumping effectively, leading to fluid accumulation in the lungs.

A loop diuretic is the most appropriate medication to treat CHF by increasing urine production and reducing fluid overload in the body. It works by blocking the reabsorption of sodium and chloride ions in the renal tubules, leading to increased urine production. This will help alleviate symptoms of CHF, such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling in the legs and ankles.

In contrast, choice B, pulmonary artery catheter placement, may be necessary for hemodynamic monitoring in some cases of CHF, but it is not the most appropriate initial treatment for this patient's presentation.

Choice C, computed tomography angiography of the chest, may be used to diagnose pulmonary embolism, but it is not directly related to the patient's current symptoms or diagnosis of CHF.

Choice D, transfusion of 2 units of packed red blood cells, may be appropriate for symptomatic anemia, but it is not the most urgent intervention needed for this patient's CHF.

Therefore, the correct answer is A, The patient is in congestive heart failure and needs a loop diuretic.

The correct answer is C. Perform excisional biopsy.

Let's go through each of the answer choices and explain why they are incorrect or correct:

A. Prescribe topical interferon drops: Interferon drops are commonly used to treat ocular surface tumors, such as squamous cell carcinoma. However, in this case, the mass is large and fungating, which suggests that it may be a more aggressive tumor that requires a more invasive treatment. Topical interferon drops may not be sufficient to treat the tumor effectively, and may not be able to penetrate the thickened conjunctiva and cornea to reach the tumor. Therefore, choice A is incorrect.

B. Prescribe topical interferon drops followed by excisional biopsy: This choice is incorrect for the same reason as choice A. While topical interferon drops may be effective in some cases, they may not be sufficient to treat a large and aggressive tumor like the one described in the case. Additionally, excisional biopsy may not be necessary if the tumor is already clearly visible and accessible for biopsy.

D. Recommend enucleation: Enucleation is a surgical procedure that involves removing the entire eye. While it may be necessary in some cases of advanced ocular tumors, it is not the first line of treatment for a fungating mass like the one described in the case. Enucleation is a more invasive and drastic measure that should only be considered after other treatment options have been exhausted. Therefore, choice D is incorrect.

C. Perform excisional biopsy: Excisional biopsy is the most appropriate choice for this case. It allows for a tissue sample to be obtained for histopathological analysis, which can provide a definitive diagnosis of the tumor. The size and location of the mass make it accessible for biopsy, and it is the least invasive procedure that can provide a diagnosis. Additionally, excisional biopsy can be performed under local anesthesia, which reduces the risk of complications compared to more invasive procedures like enucleation.

**Answer**:A. Perform funduscopic examination (under anesthesia)

The correct answer is A, Perform funduscopic examination (under anesthesia), because it is the most appropriate step in the evaluation of a child with a white pupil. A funduscopic examination is necessary to assess the retina and choroidal structures, which cannot be adequately evaluated without proper dilation and anesthesia. The presence of a white pupillary reflection (leukocoria) suggests a possible underlying retinal or choroidal abnormality, and a funduscopic examination will help to identify the cause of the abnormal reflection.

Choice B, Reassure parents and follow up in 3 months, is not appropriate because it does not address the underlying cause of the child's symptoms. While it is important to reassure parents and provide appropriate follow-up care, it is essential to perform a thorough evaluation to determine the cause of the white pupil before deciding on a management plan.

Choice C, Obtain serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for Toxocara canis, is not appropriate at this stage of the evaluation. Toxocara canis is a parasite that can cause retinal damage, but it is not the most likely cause of a white pupil in a healthy 4-year-old child. It is important to perform a funduscopic examination first to assess the retina and choroidal structures before considering serological tests for parasitic infections.

Choice D, Start urgent anti-inflammatory or steroid therapy for uveitis, is not appropriate because there is no evidence of uveitis in the patient's presentation. Uveitis is inflammation of the uveal tract, and it may present with symptoms such as pain, redness, and blurred vision. While it is important to consider uveitis in the differential diagnosis of a white pupil, it is not the most likely diagnosis in this case, and starting anti-inflammatory or steroid therapy without a proper diagnosis may be harmful.

**Answer**:C. Further laboratory and imaging studies

The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a complicated case of sarcoidosis, with granulomatous anterior iritis, uveitis, and panuveitis. The patient has already been treated with prednisolone acetate, and the response has been suboptimal. In this scenario, further laboratory and imaging studies are necessary to better understand the patient's condition and guide further management.

Option A, increasing the dose of prednisone, may be considered, but it is not the most appropriate next step. While steroids are a cornerstone of treatment for sarcoidosis, the patient's poor response to previous treatment suggests that other factors may be at play. Additionally, high doses of steroids can have significant side effects, and it is important to consider alternative treatments before escalating steroid therapy.

Option B, adding an immunomodulatory agent, may also be considered. However, the patient's history of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung and the presence of mutton fat keratic precipitates and cells in both eyes suggest that the patient may have a more aggressive form of sarcoidosis. In this case, immunomodulatory agents may not be sufficient to control the disease, and further diagnostic testing is needed to determine the best course of action.

Option D, urgent immunology consultation for treatment of steroid-resistant sarcoidosis, may be appropriate in some cases, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this scenario. While an immunology consultation may be helpful in managing the patient's disease, it is important to first gather more information about the patient's condition through further laboratory and imaging studies.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C, further laboratory and imaging studies. This will help to identify any underlying causes of the patient's symptoms and guide further management. Some potential tests that may be ordered include:

* Complete blood count (CBC) to assess for inflammation, anemia, or other blood abnormalities
* Lipid profile to assess for hyperlipidemia, which can be associated with sarcoidosis
* Serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level

**Answer**: A. Ultrasonography or MRI allowing for characterization of the lesion and its extent

The correct answer is A, Ultrasonography or MRI allowing for characterization of the lesion and its extent, because it is the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic workup of this patient's lesion.

B, Shave biopsy that would confirm squamous cell carcinoma, is not the best next step because it would not provide information about the extent of the lesion, which is important to determine the appropriate course of treatment. Additionally, a shave biopsy may not be sufficient to diagnose the lesion, as it may not capture the full depth of the lesion.

C, Immediate excision that would permanently resolve the lesion, is not the best next step because it would not allow for proper characterization of the lesion and its extent before surgery. Excision should be considered after proper diagnosis and staging of the lesion.

D, No treatment or diagnostic tests are necessary at this time, is not a viable option because the patient presents with a concerning lesion that has evolved over time, and it is important to rule out potential malignancy.

Therefore, the best next step would be to perform an imaging study, such as ultrasonography or MRI, to characterize the lesion and its extent, which would help guide further management and treatment.

**Answer**: C. Iatrogenic pancreas transplant thrombosis

The correct answer is C, Iatrogenic pancreas transplant thrombosis, because the patient's symptoms and imaging findings are consistent with this diagnosis.

The patient's history of simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation 15 years ago and the recent peripheral angiogram procedure suggest that the patient has a transplanted pancreas. The patient's symptoms of nausea and low-grade fever, along with the imaging findings of an air-containing abscess and a stent in the common iliac artery, are consistent with a complication of the transplanted pancreas, such as thrombosis.

Thrombosis is a known complication of pancreas transplantation and can occur acutely or chronically. Acute thrombosis typically presents with sudden onset of severe abdominal pain, fever, and nausea, which are consistent with the patient's symptoms. The imaging findings of an air-containing abscess and a stent in the common iliac artery also support this diagnosis, as thrombosis can cause infarction of the transplanted pancreas, leading to abscess formation.

The other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.

A. Ruptured acute appendicitis: The patient's symptoms of nausea and low-grade fever are not typical of acute appendicitis, which typically presents with severe, persistent abdominal pain, fever, and vomiting. Additionally, the imaging findings of an air-containing abscess and a stent in the common iliac artery do not support this diagnosis.

B. Cecal inflammation with abscess: While the patient's symptoms of nausea and fever could be consistent with cecal inflammation, the imaging findings do not support this diagnosis. The presence of a stent in the common iliac artery and the absence of any findings suggestive of cecal inflammation or abscess on the imaging study make this diagnosis

**Answer**: D. Appendiceal intussusception

The correct diagnosis is appendiceal intussusception, which is a rare condition where the appendix telescopes into itself, leading to a closed-loop obstruction. This diagnosis is supported by several factors:

1. Symptoms: The patient's symptoms of right lower quadrant pain, loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting are consistent with appendiceal intussusception.
2. Imaging: The CT scan and ultrasonography were inconclusive, but the MRI showed a suspicious structure within the cecum, which was confirmed by the histologic analysis of the resected appendix.
3. Histology: The histologic slide of the resected appendix showed positive progesterone receptor immunostaining, which supports the diagnosis of appendiceal intussusception.
4. Intraoperative findings: During the laparoscopic exploration, the surgeon found that the patient required an ileocecectomy, which is a surgical procedure that involves the removal of the cecum and the terminal ileum. This procedure is typically performed for appendiceal intussusception.

Now, let's discuss why the other answer choices are incorrect:

A. Acute appendicitis: Although the patient had symptoms similar to acute appendicitis, such as right lower quadrant pain and nausea, the imaging studies did not show any signs of appendiceal inflammation or perforation. Additionally, the histologic analysis did not reveal any evidence of acute appendicitis.

B. Cecal diverticulum: Cecal diverticulum is a rare condition where a pouch-like structure forms in the wall of the cecum. However, this diagnosis is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.

C. Carcinoid tumor of the appendix: Carcinoid tumors are rare tumors that originate in the appendix. However, this diagnosis is unlikely based on the patient's symptoms and imaging findings, as well as the histologic analysis of the resected appendix, which did not show any evidence of

**Answer**:A. Do not intervene; the condition is benign

The correct answer is A, "Do not intervene; the condition is benign," because the patient's symptoms and medical history suggest that the nodular protuberance on the hard palate is a benign growth, and there is no indication for intervention.

The patient has had the growth for over 20 years, and it has been slowly enlarging over the past year. However, the patient denies pain, discomfort, or any other symptoms that would suggest the growth is causing harm. The patient also has a healthy appearance, and the remainder of the physical examination is unremarkable.

Given the patient's history and physical examination, it is likely that the growth is a benign tumor, such as a torus palatinus, which is a common, slow-growing benign tumor that occurs on the hard palate. Torus palatinus is usually asymptomatic and does not require treatment unless it becomes large enough to interfere with speech or swallowing.

Therefore, the best course of action is to monitor the patient's condition and not intervene unless there are changes in the size or symptoms of the growth. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head (choice C) may be unnecessary and could potentially expose the patient to unnecessary radiation. A biopsy of the lesion (choice B) may also be unnecessary and could potentially cause harm to the patient. Referring the patient to an oral surgeon for evaluation and full-mouth dental x-rays (choice D) may be appropriate, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case.

The correct answer is C: Recommend removal of the entire nail plate with representative biopsy of all areas of pigment.

This is the best option because the patient has a 10-year history of progressive nail pigmentation, which suggests that the pigmentation is likely to be a melanocytic nevus or melanoma. The pigmentation is also spreading to the proximal nail fold and distal acral hyponychial skin, which increases the concern for a malignant process.

Removing the entire nail plate with representative biopsy of all areas of pigment allows for a thorough evaluation of the nail bed and surrounding tissue to determine if there is any evidence of melanoma or other malignancies. This approach is particularly important in this case because the patient has a history of reassurance that the pigmentation is benign, which may have led to a delay in proper diagnosis and treatment.

In contrast, option A, reassuring the patient that the pigmentation is benign, is not appropriate given the patient's history and the persistent and progressive nature of the pigmentation. Option B, performing a punch biopsy of the nail bed through the intact nail plate, may not provide a representative sample of the entire nail bed and may not detect any malignant cells that may be present. Option D, sending clippings of the free edge of the nail plate for histopathology and culture, is also not appropriate as it is not a diagnostic procedure and may not provide sufficient tissue for evaluation.

Therefore, option C is the best answer.

The correct answer is D: Contact patient's hepatologist.

The patient's history of cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis C, along with the presence of cotton-wool spots and retinal hemorrhages, suggests a possible diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. However, it is important to note that the patient's current medication regimen, including ribavirin and peginterferon alfa-2a, can also cause retinal toxicity.

Therefore, before making any changes to the patient's treatment plan, it is important to consult with the patient's hepatologist to discuss the potential risks and benefits of continuing or discontinuing the medication regimen. The hepatologist can provide valuable insight into the patient's liver disease and help determine the appropriate course of action.

In contrast, checking the patient's hemoglobin A1c level (choice A) may not provide useful information in this case, as the patient's history of cirrhosis and retinal findings suggest a possible diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy, which is not necessarily related to blood sugar control.

Checking for hypertension (choice B) is not directly related to the patient's current symptoms or medical history, and it is not clear how this information would impact the patient's treatment plan.

Discontinuing interferon therapy (choice C) may be appropriate, but it is not clear whether this would address the underlying cause of the patient's retinal findings. Consulting with the patient's hepatologist can help determine the appropriate course of action regarding the medication regimen.

Therefore, the best answer is D: Contact patient's hepatologist.

**Answer**:C. Scabies

The correct answer is C. Scabies. The patient's symptoms, such as the presence of numerous erythematous macules, papules, and pustules on her back, and the linear array of grouped papules, are consistent with scabies. Additionally, the fact that the patient's father worked in a nursing home that had experienced a recent outbreak of scabies and that the patient and all family members were treated with permethrin, 5%, cream, suggests that the patient was exposed to scabies and did not respond to the treatment.

A. Langerhans cell histiocytosis is an autoimmune disorder that can cause skin lesions, but it is not typically associated with the symptoms described in the case.

B. Contact dermatitis is a skin reaction caused by exposure to an allergen or irritant, but it is not typically associated with the widespread papular eruption described in the case.

The correct diagnosis is B. Angioleiomyoma, which is a rare benign vascular tumor that typically affects the soft tissues of the extremities, but can also occur in the abdomen. The patient's symptoms, imaging findings, and histopathological features are all consistent with this diagnosis.

A. Hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm is an incorrect choice because the patient's imaging findings do not suggest a pseudoaneurysm. A pseudoaneurysm is a dilatation of the artery that occurs due to a tear in the arterial wall, and it is typically seen as a well-defined, rounded or oval-shaped mass that is separate from the surrounding tissues. In contrast, the patient's imaging findings show a well-defined, hypoechoic lesion that abuts the pancreas and surrounds the common hepatic artery, which is consistent with an angioleiomyoma.

C. Neuroendocrine tumors are tumors that arise from the neuroendocrine cells of the pancreas and are typically associated with symptoms such as abdominal pain, weight loss, and diarrhea. The patient's symptoms and imaging findings do not suggest a neuroendocrine tumor.

D. Angiosarcoma is a malignant vascular tumor that can arise from the blood vessels of any organ, including the liver. However, the patient's imaging findings and histopathological features do not suggest an angiosarcoma. Angiosarcomas typically have a more irregular shape and are associated with more prominent necrosis and mitotic activity than what is described in the patient's specimen.

Therefore, the correct diagnosis is B. Angioleiomyoma.

**Answer: A. Hedrocele**

A hedrocele is a rare condition characterized by a fluid-filled sac that forms in the presacral space, which is the area between the rectum and the sacrum. The presacral space is normally filled with fat and connective tissue, but in cases of hedrocele, it becomes occupied by a cystic structure that can compress the rectum and cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, distension, and difficulty passing stool.

Given the patient's symptoms of a painful anal mass, vomiting, and constipation, as well as the physical examination findings of a mass exteriorized through the anal canal, covered by hypoxemic rectal mucosa, and no digestive lumen identified inside the mass, hedrocele is a strong possibility. The absence of tenderness to palpation and the presence of air-fluid levels on the abdominal radiograph, which suggests an intestinal occlusion, also support this diagnosis.

In contrast, rectal prolapse (choice B) is a condition where the rectum protrudes through the anus, often due to weakening of the muscles and ligaments that support the rectum. While rectal prolapse can cause similar symptoms to hedrocele, such as abdominal pain and difficulty passing stool, it is typically associated with a history of straining during bowel movements, and the physical examination findings would show a protrusion of the rectal mucosa through the anus, rather than a fluid-filled sac.

Anal neoplasm (choice C) is a rare condition that can present with symptoms similar to hedrocele, such as abdominal pain and difficulty passing stool. However, anal neoplasms are typically associated with a history of anal bleeding, and the physical examination findings would show a mass in the anal canal, rather than a fluid-filled sac.

External hemorrhoids (choice D) are swollen veins in the anal canal that can cause pain, itching, and bleeding. While external hemorrhoids can cause discomfort and difficulty passing stool, they are typically not associated with vomiting

The correct answer is D. Perform a viral culture from a lip lesion.

The patient's symptoms of oral ulcers and targetoid lesions on the palms are consistent with a diagnosis of herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. The presence of shallow erosions with hemorrhagic crusts on the lips and widespread targetoid macules with dusky centers on the palms are both characteristic features of HSV infection.

Performing a viral culture from a lip lesion (choice D) is the most appropriate next step in the patient's management. This is because HSV infection can be diagnosed by isolating the virus from the lesion, and a viral culture is the gold standard for diagnosing HSV infection. The viral culture can also help to identify the specific type of HSV virus (HSV-1 or HSV-2) that is causing the infection.

The other choices are not the most appropriate next steps in the patient's management:

A. Ordering a chest radiograph (choice A) is not necessary at this stage, as the patient does not have any respiratory symptoms or signs of pneumonia. Chest radiographs are typically used to evaluate patients with respiratory symptoms or to monitor patients with known respiratory disease.

B. Ordering a rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test (choice B) may be appropriate later in the patient's management, but it is not the most appropriate next step. The RPR test is used to screen for syphilis, which is a sexually transmitted infection caused by Treponema pallidum. While syphilis can cause oral ulcers and skin lesions, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are not consistent with syphilis.

C. Performing a skin biopsy of a targetoid lesion on the palm (choice C) may also be appropriate later in the patient's management, but it is not the most appropriate next step. A skin biopsy can help to confirm the diagnosis of HSV infection and may be necessary if the viral culture is negative or inconclusive. However, a skin biopsy is not necessary at this stage

**Answer**:B. Obtain tissue for bacterial culture from both areas and start a systemic antibiotic.

This is the correct answer because it is important to identify the cause of the patient's symptoms, which could be either bacterial or fungal infection. Obtaining tissue for bacterial culture from both areas (perianal and shin) will help to determine if there is a bacterial infection present, and starting a systemic antibiotic will help to treat the infection.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Obtain a skin biopsy of the affected area on the left shin and apply a topical antibiotic to both the perianal area and the shin area until the pathology result is available.
This option is not the best choice because it does not address the patient's symptoms or help to identify the cause of the symptoms. A skin biopsy may be necessary later on to rule out other skin conditions, but it is not the most appropriate step at this time.

C. Obtain both bacterial culture and fungal culture of the affected areas and administer both a systemic antibiotic and a systemic antifungal agent.
This option is not the best choice because it is not necessary to start both a systemic antibiotic and a systemic antifungal agent without first identifying the cause of the patient's symptoms. It is important to determine if the infection is bacterial or fungal before starting treatment.

D. Obtain fungal culture from both affected areas and initiate systemic antifungal therapy.
This option is not the best choice because it assumes that the infection is fungal without first confirming the diagnosis through a culture. It is important to identify the cause of the patient's symptoms before starting treatment.

**Answer**:A. Inquire about family cancer history and order genetic testing
The patient's presentation of bilateral pigmented ocular fundus lesions, along with the presence of a fibrotic-appearing epiretinal membrane and retinal hamartoma, raises the suspicion of a genetic disorder. The patient's young age and lack of significant medical history or prior ocular problems also support this possibility.

Option A, inquiring about family cancer history and ordering genetic testing, is the most appropriate next step in the patient's management. This is because genetic disorders can be associated with an increased risk of certain types of cancer, and a positive family history of cancer may indicate the presence of a genetic syndrome. Additionally, genetic testing can help identify specific genetic mutations that may be associated with the patient's ocular findings.

Option B, pars plana vitrectomy and retinal biopsy, is not the most appropriate next step. While this procedure may be necessary in some cases of retinal disease, it is not typically recommended for the evaluation of bilateral pigmented ocular fundus lesions in a young patient with no significant medical history.

Option C, diode laser treatment to lesions, is also not the most appropriate next step. Laser treatment may be effective for certain types of retinal lesions, but it is not typically used for the treatment of pigmented ocular fundus lesions.

Option D, metastatic workup, is not relevant to the patient's presentation. There is no evidence to suggest that the patient has a metastatic condition, and a workup for metastatic disease would not be appropriate at this time.

**Answer**:D. Minocycline-induced cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa

The correct answer is D. Minocycline-induced cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa.

The patient's symptoms, including the painful bullous skin lesion, generalized myalgia, polyarthralgia, joint stiffness, paraesthesia, and episodic ankle swelling, are consistent with polyarteritis nodosa (PAN), a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the small and medium-sized blood vessels. The patient's history of minocycline use for acne suggests a possible adverse effect of the medication, which has been associated with PAN in rare cases.

The patient's laboratory results, including a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) with a nucleolar pattern, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum IgG levels, support the diagnosis of PAN. The absence of other potential causes of PAN, such as infection or malignancy, also supports the diagnosis.

The other answer choices are not as likely as the correct diagnosis for the following reasons:

A. Erythema nodosum: Erythema nodosum is a type of panniculitis that is characterized by the development of tender, erythematous nodules on the shins and legs. While the patient's skin lesion may resemble erythema nodosum, the presence of myalgia, polyarthralgia, joint stiffness, and paraesthesia suggest a more systemic disorder, such as PAN.

B. Sarcoidosis: Sarcoidosis is a chronic granulomatous disease that can affect various organs, including the skin, lungs, and lymph nodes. While the patient's skin lesion and laboratory results may be consistent with sarcoidosis, the absence of other characteristic findings, such as lung involvement or lymphadenopathy, makes this diagnosis less likely.

The correct answer is C: Metastatic cystic neuroendocrine tumors.

Let's go through each answer choice and explain why it's incorrect or correct:

A: Biliary cystadenomas
Biliary cystadenomas are benign tumors that arise from the epithelial lining of the bile ducts within the liver. They are typically slow-growing and asymptomatic, and are often discovered incidentally during imaging studies. While they can cause abdominal pain, they are not typically associated with the symptoms described in the case, such as dull epigastric and right upper quadrant abdominal pain. Additionally, the patient's age and the presence of atypical cells suspicious for malignancy on biopsy suggest a more aggressive diagnosis. Therefore, choice A is incorrect.

B: Amebic liver abscess secondary to Entamoeba histolytica infection
Amebic liver abscess is a complication of Entamoeba histolytica infection, which can cause liver abscesses, perforation of the intestine, and peritonitis. However, the patient's symptoms and imaging findings do not suggest an abscess. Additionally, the patient's history and physical examination do not reveal any signs of infection, such as fever, chills, or abdominal tenderness. Therefore, choice B is incorrect.

C: Metastatic cystic neuroendocrine tumors
Metastatic cystic neuroendocrine tumors are malignant tumors that arise from the neuroendocrine cells of the pancreas, lung, or other organs. They can metastasize to the liver and cause cystic lesions. The patient's symptoms, imaging findings, and biopsy results are consistent with this diagnosis. The presence of atypical cells suspicious for malignancy on biopsy and the patient's age also support this diagnosis. Therefore, choice C is correct.

**Answer**: B. Spindle cell sarcoma of the chest wall

The patient's history of radiation therapy to the left breast and axillary basin, as well as the absence of any distant disease on positron emission tomography, suggest that the mass is unlikely to be metastatic breast carcinoma (choice C).

The patient's history of synchronous rectal cancer and neoadjuvant chemoradiation also make it unlikely that the mass is metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma (choice A).

A desmoid tumor of the chest wall (choice D) would not be expected to demonstrate the metabolic activity seen on positron emission tomography.

Spindle cell sarcoma of the chest wall (choice B) is a rare tumor that can arise in the chest wall, and the patient's symptoms and imaging findings are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's history of radiation therapy may also increase the risk of developing a sarcoma.

Therefore, based on the patient's history, symptoms, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is spindle cell sarcoma of the chest wall (choice B).

**Answer**:C. Perform an incisional skin biopsy

The patient's history of recurrent abdominal pain, tender subcutaneous nodules, and elevated serum lipase and amylase levels suggest a possible diagnosis of pancreatic panniculitis, a rare condition characterized by inflammation of the subcutaneous fat. The presence of tender nodules on the extremities, which are initially very painful and slow to resolve, and the appearance of new lesions with or immediately after episodes of acute pancreatitis, further support this diagnosis.

Performing an incisional skin biopsy (choice C) would allow for a histopathological evaluation of the nodule and help establish the diagnosis of pancreatic panniculitis. This is the most appropriate next step in the patient's management, as it would provide valuable information for guiding further treatment.

Obtaining a computed tomography scan of the chest and abdomen (choice B) may also be useful in evaluating the patient's condition, particularly if the biopsy results suggest a diagnosis of pancreatic panniculitis. However, it is not the most appropriate next step, as it would not provide a definitive diagnosis and may not guide treatment decisions as effectively as a skin biopsy.

Ordering a tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test (choice D) may be considered in the patient's evaluation, given the patient's history of hepatitis B and the possibility of underlying tuberculosis. However, it is not the most appropriate next step at this time, as the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not strongly suggest tuberculosis.

Obtaining a blood culture (choice A) may be appropriate in the patient's evaluation, particularly if there are concerns about sepsis or bacterial infection. However, it is not the most appropriate next step, as the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not strongly suggest bacterial infection, and a blood culture would not provide information specific to the patient's skin lesions.

**Answer**: D. Tinea incognito.

Tinea incognito, also known as tinea faciei, is a type of fungal infection that affects the skin, particularly the face. It is caused by a group of fungi called dermatophytes, which thrive in warm and moist environments. The infection is characterized by the formation of circular, ring-like lesions on the skin, with a tendency towards central clearing and peripheral scaling and erythema.

In the case presented, the patient had a 3-month history of a pruritic rash bilaterally on the cheeks, which initially was thought to be related to mosquito bites. However, the rash failed to clear with various treatments, including topical corticosteroids, antifungals, and antibiotics. The presence of persistent acneiform papules on the cheeks with postinflammatory hyperpigmentation led to a therapeutic trial of erythromycin, which is an antibiotic that can also have anti-inflammatory effects. However, the patient presented with two slowly expanding, hyperpigmented, ringlike lesions with a tendency toward central clearing and peripheral scaling and erythema on the right cheek, which is consistent with the characteristic appearance of tinea incognito.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

A. Numular eczema: Numular eczema, also known as nummular dermatitis, is a type of eczema that appears as coin-shaped patches on the skin. While it can cause itching and redness, it does not have the characteristic ring-like appearance of tinea incognito.

B. Erythema annulare centrifugum: Erythema annulare centrifugum is a type of skin rash that appears as a ring-like lesion with a clear center and a raised, scaly border. However, it typically appears on the trunk and extremities, rather than the face, and is not associated with fungal infections.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with Glucagonoma, a rare pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor that secretes glucagon, leading to hyperglucagonemia. The patient's history of ischemic heart disease, familial Mediterranean fever, and arthropathy increases the likelihood of Glucagonoma. The patient's skin rash and weight loss are also consistent with Glucagonoma, as glucagon can cause skin necrosis and fat atrophy.

B. Insulinoma is an incorrect choice because although Insulinoma can cause hypoglycemia, it does not typically cause skin rash or weight loss.

C. VIPoma is an incorrect choice because although VIPoma can cause watery diarrhea, it does not typically cause skin rash or weight loss.

D. Skin amyloidosis is an incorrect choice because it does not typically cause skin rash or weight loss.

Therefore, the correct answer is A. Glucagonoma.

**Answer**:C. Calcific uremic arteriolopathy

Explanation:
Calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA) is a rare complication of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is characterized by the deposition of calcium in the walls of small blood vessels, leading to vessel stenosis or occlusion. The patient's symptoms of progressive cutaneous necrosis and muscle weakness, along with the physical examination findings of necrosis and eschar formation involving the fingers, toes, and calves, and the violaceous skin with central eschar on the posterior medial aspect of the right leg, are consistent with CUA. The patient's history of ESRD and hemodialysis also increases the likelihood of CUA.

The laboratory findings also support the diagnosis of CUA, as the patient's blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels indicate ESRD, and the intact parathyroid hormone level is elevated, which is consistent with secondary hyperparathyroidism, a common complication of ESRD. The skin biopsy findings of epidermal necrosis, dermal hemorrhage, focal dermal intravascular thrombi, and subcutaneous intravascular and extravascular calcifications are also consistent with CUA.

In contrast, subacute bacterial endocarditis (choice A) is unlikely given the absence of fever, chills, or other signs of infection. Warfarin-induced skin necrosis (choice B) is also unlikely, as the patient's international normalized ratio (INR) of 2.4 is not significantly elevated, and there is no history of recent warfarin initiation or dose adjustment. Buerger disease (choice D) is a possibility, but it is less likely given the absence of a history of tobacco use and the presence of other findings consistent with CUA.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, laboratory results, and medical history, the most likely diagnosis is calcific uremic arter

**Answer**: C. Perform angioplasty of the right renal artery and angioplasty with stenting of the right external iliac artery.

The correct answer is C because it addresses the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, which is the stenosis of the right external iliac artery and the beaded appearance of the right renal artery. Angioplasty and stenting can help to widen the narrowed artery and improve blood flow to the affected limb, thereby relieving the patient's symptoms of exertional pain and limited exercise tolerance.

Option A, performing angioplasty and stenting of both the right renal and external iliac arteries, may not be necessary based on the patient's current symptoms and examination findings. Although the patient does have hypertension, the blood pressure is currently well-controlled with lisinopril, and there is no evidence of significant atherosclerosis or other cardiovascular risk factors.

Option B, managing the patient medically with antihypertensive agents and a walking program, may not be sufficient to address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, which is the stenosis of the right external iliac artery. While a walking program may help to improve the patient's overall fitness and cardiovascular health, it is unlikely to resolve the patient's exertional pain and limited exercise tolerance without addressing the underlying arterial stenosis.

Option D, administering cilostazol for claudication and continuing lisinopril for hypertension, may not be the most appropriate choice at this time. Cilostazol is a medication that is used to treat intermittent claudication, which is pain in the legs that occurs during exercise and resolves with rest. While the patient does have exertional pain, the pain resolves within 2 minutes of rest, which suggests that the patient's symptoms may be more severe than intermittent claudication. Additionally, the patient's hypertension is already well-controlled with lisinopril, and there is no indication to discontinue this medication.

**Answer**: B. Ecthyma gangrenosum

Ecthyma gangrenosum is a rare, severe, and life-threatening skin infection that typically affects newborns and immunocompromised individuals. It is caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes, and is characterized by the rapid progression of skin lesions, which can lead to necrotic ulcers and sepsis.

The patient's history and physical examination findings are consistent with ecthyma gangrenosum. The patient developed violaceous skin lesions with edema in the inguinal and axillary regions, which progressed to ulceration and infarction within a few days. The patient's mother had a history of drug addiction and hepatitis C virus infection, which increases the risk of neonatal infection. The patient's premature rupture of membranes and forceps delivery may have also contributed to the development of the infection.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (choice A) is a different type of skin infection that is also caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. It is characterized by the rapid progression of skin lesions, but it typically affects healthy individuals and does not have the same degree of severity as ecthyma gangrenosum.

Wegener granulomatosis (choice C) is a systemic vasculitis that can affect the skin and other organs. It is caused by the deposition of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) and is characterized by the presence of granulomas. While skin lesions can be a manifestation of Wegener granulomatosis, the patient's history and physical examination findings do not suggest this diagnosis.

Meningococcemia (choice D) is a severe bacterial infection caused by Neisseria meningitidis. While it can cause skin lesions, the patient's history and physical examination findings do not suggest this diagnosis.

**Answer**:C. Internal iliac artery aneurysm

The patient's symptoms of worsening lower back and lower extremity pain, treated as sciatica on an outpatient basis, for 3 months, along with the physical examination findings of a firm, nonpulsatile, slightly tender mass in the left lower quadrant and significant perineal ecchymosis, suggest a possible diagnosis of an internal iliac artery aneurysm. This is supported by the computed tomographic images of the abdomen and pelvis, which show the bladder displaced to the right and a Foley catheter located anteriorly, indicating compression of the bladder by the aneurysm. Additionally, the patient's history of hypertension and abdominal aortic aneurysm repair increase the likelihood of an aneurysm.

 choice A, prostate cancer, is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and medical history. While the patient's age and history of hypertension increase the risk of prostate cancer, the patient's symptoms of lower back and lower extremity pain are not typical of prostate cancer. Additionally, the physical examination findings of a firm, nonpulsatile, slightly tender mass in the left lower quadrant are not consistent with a prostate cancer diagnosis.

 choice B, recurrent colon cancer, is also unlikely given the patient's symptoms and medical history. While the patient has a history of colon cancer, the patient's symptoms of worsening lower back and lower extremity pain, treated as sciatica on an outpatient basis, for 3 months, are not typical of colon cancer recurrence. Additionally, the physical examination findings of a firm, nonpulsatile, slightly tender mass in the left lower quadrant and significant perineal ecchymosis are not consistent with a colon cancer diagnosis.

 choice D, primary lymphoma of the urinary bladder, is a rare condition and is not supported by the patient's symptoms or medical history.

The correct answer is C. Squamous cell carcinoma.

A. Pulmonary aspergilloma is an incorrect choice because, although the patient's symptoms and radiologic findings are consistent with pulmonary aspergillosis, the presence of a cavitary lesion with a central contrast-enhanced ball-like mass suggests a possible lung malignancy, which cannot be excluded based on the patient's history and physical examination findings.

B. Pulmonary tuberculosis is an incorrect choice because the patient's symptoms and radiologic findings are not consistent with pulmonary tuberculosis. The patient's history of smoking and the presence of a cavitary lesion with a central contrast-enhanced ball-like mass are not typical findings in pulmonary tuberculosis.

D. Pulmonary hydatid cyst is an incorrect choice because the patient's symptoms and radiologic findings are not consistent with pulmonary hydatid cyst. The patient's history of smoking and the presence of a cavitary lesion with a central contrast-enhanced ball-like mass are not typical findings in pulmonary hydatid cyst.

The correct answer is D: Postpone treatment; obtain random skin biopsies and a bone marrow biopsy.

Let's go through each of the answer choices and explain why they are incorrect or correct:

A: Initiate secondary preventive treatment for multiple infarctions with antiplatelet agents.

This choice is incorrect because while antiplatelet agents may be appropriate for secondary prevention of stroke, they do not address the underlying cause of the multiple infarctions, which is likely vasculitis. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a systemic inflammatory process, and initiating antiplatelet therapy without further evaluation may not effectively manage the patient's condition.

B: Initiate treatment for cerebral vasculitis with corticosteroids.

This choice is also incorrect because while corticosteroids may be appropriate for treating vasculitis, there is no definitive diagnosis of cerebral vasculitis yet. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a systemic inflammatory process, but further evaluation is needed to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate treatment.

C: Postpone treatment; obtain a brain biopsy including the leptomeninges.

This choice is incorrect because a brain biopsy may not be necessary at this point in the patient's management. While a brain biopsy may be helpful in diagnosing certain conditions, it is an invasive procedure that carries risks, and there are other ways to evaluate the patient's condition that are less invasive.

D: Postpone treatment; obtain random skin biopsies and a bone marrow biopsy.

This choice is correct because it allows for further evaluation of the patient's systemic inflammatory process without immediately initiating treatment. Random skin biopsies and a bone marrow biopsy can help to identify the presence of vasculitis or other inflammatory conditions, which would guide further management. Additionally, these procedures are relatively low-risk and can provide valuable information to help direct the patient's care.

In summary, the correct answer is D: Postpone treatment; obtain random skin biopsies and a bone marrow biopsy. This choice

**Answer**:C. Obtain lesional and perilesional skin biopsies for histopathology and direct immunofluorescence stains

The correct answer is C. Obtain lesional and perilesional skin biopsies for histopathology and direct immunofluorescence stains.

The patient presents with a mildly pruritic, progressive rash that has spread over 9 days, with grouped vesicles and tense bullae in a generalized distribution on the trunk and extremities. The patient has no relevant medical history, denies any medication use, and has received appropriate immunizations. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of annular vesiculobullous eruption.

Obtaining lesional and perilesional skin biopsies for histopathology and direct immunofluorescence stains is the most appropriate next step in management. This will allow for a definitive diagnosis of the eruption, which is essential for appropriate treatment and management.

Empirically treating the patient with topical corticosteroids, as option A suggests, may provide some symptomatic relief, but it will not provide a definitive diagnosis or address the underlying cause of the eruption.

Option B, obtaining blister fluid culture, Gram stain, and viral polymerase chain reaction assay, may be useful in identifying a potential infectious cause of the eruption, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management. The patient's history and physical examination do not suggest an infectious etiology, and the presence of grouped vesicles and tense bullae is not consistent with a typical infectious process.

Transferring the patient to a burn unit for intensive supportive care, as option D suggests, may be necessary if the patient's condition worsens or if there are concerns about infection or other complications. However, at this point in management, it is premature to consider transferring the patient to a burn unit.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management is to obtain lesional and perilesional skin biopsies for histopathology and direct immunofluorescence stains to establish a definitive diagnosis and guide further

**Answer**: C. Vitreous biopsy

The patient's symptoms of a "smudge" in her central vision and associated photopsias, along with the physical examination findings of yellow-white, multisized, subretinal, creamy lesions in various portions of her retina, including the periphery, are consistent with a diagnosis of vitreomacular traction (VMT). VMT is a condition in which the vitreous gel pulls on the retina, causing distortion or vision loss.

The correct answer is C. Vitreous biopsy, as it is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's condition. A vitreous biopsy would allow for a definitive diagnosis of VMT and would also help to rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a retinal tear or detachment.

Option A, Observation, is not the most appropriate next step, as the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a more urgent need for intervention.

Option B, Oral corticosteroid, may be considered in the management of VMT, but it is not the most appropriate next step. Corticosteroids may be used to reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms, but they do not address the underlying cause of the condition.

Option D, Extended workup, may include additional tests such as ultrasonography, electroretinography, or optical coherence tomography, but it is not the most appropriate next step. These tests may provide additional information, but they do not provide a definitive diagnosis or guide management.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Vitreous biopsy.

Sure, please find my answer below:

**Answer**: C. Nevus sebaceous of Jadassohn

Explanation:

A. Congenital melanocytic nevus: This type of nevus is usually present at birth or appears within the first few months of life. It is caused by a genetic mutation that affects the development of melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells in the skin. The lesion in the case is not present at birth, but rather develops at puberty, which makes it less likely to be a congenital melanocytic nevus.

B. Epidermal nevus: This type of nevus is a benign growth that originates from the epidermis, the outermost layer of the skin. It can appear as a raised, rough, or wart-like lesion. However, the lesion in the case has a verrucous, papillated texture, which is not typical of epidermal nevi.

D. Inflammatory linear verrucous epidermal nevus: This is a rare type of nevus that is characterized by a linear, wart-like lesion on the skin. It is usually caused by an inflammatory response to a pre-existing epidermal nevus. The lesion in the case is not linear and does not have the characteristic inflammatory features of an inflammatory linear verrucous epidermal nevus.

C. Nevus sebaceous of Jadassohn: This is a rare type of nevus that is characterized by a yellowish, orange, or brown plaque on the skin. It is caused by a benign growth of sebaceous glands, which are the glands that produce oil in the skin. The lesion in the case has a verrucous, rough texture and a yellowish-brown color, which are both consistent with a nevus sebaceous of Jadassohn. Additionally, the fact that the lesion developed at puberty and has a papillated texture also supports this diagnosis.

Therefore, based on the clinical features, the most likely diagnosis for the lesion in the case is a nevus sebaceous of Jadass

**Answer**: C. Intussusception of the appendix

The correct answer is C, Intussusception of the appendix, because the patient's symptoms and test results are consistent with this diagnosis.

Intussusception is a condition where a portion of the intestine slides into another portion, causing a blockage. In this case, the patient's symptoms of colicky abdominal pain, nausea, and loose stools are consistent with intussusception. The patient's age and lack of comorbidities also make intussusception a more likely diagnosis.

The abdominal ultrasonography and computed tomographic scan results also support this diagnosis. The "donut sign" seen on the ultrasound is a characteristic feature of intussusception, and the tubular thin-walled filling defect seen on the CT scan is consistent with a intussusception of the appendix. The fact that the oral contrast agent can be seen around, proximal, and distal to the defect, with no obstruction noted, suggests that the intussusception is not causing a complete blockage.

The other answer choices are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and test results.

A, Carcinoma of the cecum, is unlikely because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a malignancy, and there is no evidence of a mass or lesion in the cecum on the imaging studies.

B, Ileocecal intussusception, is less likely because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with this diagnosis, and the imaging studies do not show evidence of intussusception in the ileocecal region.

D, Diverticulum of the cecum, is also less likely because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with this diagnosis, and there is no evidence of a diverticulum on the imaging studies.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and test results, the most likely diagnosis is C, Intussusception of the appendix.

**Answer**:C. Type 1 choledochal cyst

The patient's symptoms of right upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, along with the imaging findings of a cystic abnormality in the region of the porta hepatis, are consistent with a diagnosis of a Type 1 choledochal cyst. This type of cyst is a congenital abnormality that occurs when the pancreatic and bile ducts fail to properly communicate with each other during fetal development.

Type 1 choledochal cysts are typically located in the porta hepatis, which is the region where the common hepatic duct and the cystic duct join to form the common bile duct. The cystic lesion in the patient's magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) and abdominal computed tomography (CT) scans is consistent with a Type 1 choledochal cyst.

The other answer choices are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.

A. Duplicate gallbladder: This is a rare congenital abnormality where there is a duplicate gallbladder that is not connected to the bile ducts. The patient's symptoms and imaging findings do not suggest the presence of a duplicate gallbladder.

B. Biliary cystadenoma: This is a rare benign tumor that arises from the epithelial lining of the bile ducts. It typically presents with symptoms of biliary obstruction, such as jaundice, pruritus, and weight loss, which are not present in this patient.

D. Hydatid cyst: This is a parasitic infection caused by the larvae of Echinococcus granulosus. It typically presents with symptoms of abdominal pain, distension, and fever, and is often associated with a history of exposure to dogs or sheep.

**Answer**:C. Prescribe antibiotic treatment and chlorhexidine mouthwashes, with no surgical intervention.

The correct answer is C. Prescribe antibiotic treatment and chlorhexidine mouthwashes, with no surgical intervention, because it is the most appropriate treatment plan for the patient's condition.

A. Extract the involved teeth and cover the exposed bone with a gingival graft is not the best option because the patient's teeth are already mobile, indicating that the bone loss is extensive. Extracting the teeth would not address the underlying bone loss, and covering the exposed bone with a gingival graft would not provide adequate bone coverage.

B. Obtain radiographs of the mandible is not the best option because it would not provide immediate treatment for the patient's symptoms. While radiographs may be useful in evaluating the extent of bone loss, they would not address the patient's discomfort or provide a solution for bone coverage.

D. Remove the whole section of the mandibular bone, including the involved teeth, to achieve bone coverage by soft tissue; if necessary, reconstruct using surgical plates is not the best option because it is an invasive and aggressive treatment plan that may not be necessary at this stage. The patient's symptoms can be managed with less invasive measures, such as antibiotic treatment and chlorhexidine mouthwashes, which can help reduce the risk of infection and promote healing.

Therefore, the best option is C. Prescribe antibiotic treatment and chlorhexidine mouthwashes, with no surgical intervention, as it is a conservative and non-invasive approach that can effectively manage the patient's symptoms and promote healing.

The correct answer is D. Order serologic tests.

The patient's symptoms of sudden-onset, painless blurred vision in one eye, along with the physical examination findings of a relative afferent pupillary defect and abnormal fundus examination, suggest a possible diagnosis of a posterior circulation stroke or a retinal artery occlusion.

Serologic tests, such as a complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and antinuclear antibodies, can help rule out other potential causes of vision loss, such as systemic inflammatory conditions, infections, or autoimmune disorders. These tests can also help identify potential underlying conditions that may have contributed to the development of the stroke or occlusion.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits, choice A, may also be useful in evaluating the patient's symptoms, but it is not the most appropriate next step. MRI can help identify structural abnormalities in the brain and orbit, but it may not provide information about the underlying cause of the vision loss. In this case, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a more urgent need for serologic tests to rule out potentially treatable conditions.

Antibiotics, choice B, are not indicated in this case, as there is no evidence of an infection.

Steroids, choice C, may be considered in certain cases of vision loss, such as optic neuritis or uveitis, but they are not the most appropriate treatment for a posterior circulation stroke or retinal artery occlusion.

Therefore, the best next step in management would be to order serologic tests to help identify the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

Proboscis lateralis is a rare congenital malformation characterized by a trunklike projection from the medial canthus of the eye. It is often associated with other craniofacial anomalies, but in this case, there were no other anomalies detected by CT scan and MRI. The presence of mucus discharge from the opening and the absence of any other craniofacial abnormalities support the diagnosis of proboscis lateralis.

A. Supernumerary nostril is an incorrect diagnosis as it refers to an accessory nostril, which is not the same as a trunklike projection from the medial canthus.

**Answer**: B. Gossypiboma

The correct answer is B. Gossypiboma, which is a type of benign tumor that originates from the peritoneum, the lining of the abdominal cavity. Gossypiboma is derived from the Greek words "gossypion" meaning cotton and "boma" meaning tumor, referring to its characteristic cotton-like appearance on cut section.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a Gossypiboma. The patient had a painless abdominal mass that had been increasing in size over several years, which is a common presentation for Gossypiboma. The mass was firm, mobile, and nontender, which are also characteristic features of Gossypiboma. The patient's history of a previous cesarean section may also be relevant, as Gossypiboma has been associated with previous abdominal surgery.

The CT scan findings also support the diagnosis of Gossypiboma. The scan showed a well-circumscribed, 10-cm mass, which is consistent with the characteristic cotton-like appearance of Gossypiboma. The mass was also located in the abdomen, which is the most common location for Gossypiboma.

The other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and CT scan findings.

A. Liposarcoma is a type of soft tissue sarcoma that originates from fat cells. While it can present as a painless abdominal mass, it is typically located in the deep soft tissue of the abdomen, rather than the peritoneum. Liposarcoma is also less likely to have the characteristic cotton-like appearance of Gossypiboma on cut section.

C. Mesenteric cyst is a rare type of cyst that originates from the mesentery, the tissue that attaches the intestine to the abdominal wall. Mesenteric cysts are typically small and located in the small intestine, rather than the large intestine as in this case. They may cause abdominal pain, but are usually not firm or mobile like the patient's mass.

**Answer**: B. Pheochromocytoma

The patient's symptoms of early satiety and heat intolerance, along with the physical examination findings of orthostatic hypotension and an immobile, nontender abdominal mass, suggest a possible diagnosis of a pheochromocytoma. Pheochromocytomas are rare tumors that originate from the chromaffin cells of the adrenal gland and produce excessive amounts of catecholamines, such as epinephrine and norepinephrine. These hormones can cause a variety of symptoms, including hypertension, palpitations, headaches, and sweating.

The patient's age and the location of the mass in the left abdomen also support the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. Pheochromocytomas are typically slow-growing tumors that can occur at any age, but they are most commonly diagnosed in patients in their 40s and 50s. Additionally, pheochromocytomas often produce symptoms that are referable to the abdomen, such as abdominal pain or discomfort, which can be confused with other abdominal pathologies.

The other answer choices are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Lymphoma (choice A) is a malignancy that can cause a variety of symptoms, including abdominal distension, but it is not typically associated with orthostatic hypotension or an immobile abdominal mass. Cystic neoplasm of the pancreas (choice C) can also cause abdominal symptoms, but it is not typically associated with hypertension or orthostatic hypotension. Rhabdomyosarcoma (choice D) is a rare soft tissue sarcoma that can occur in the abdomen, but it is not typically associated with the production of catecholamines or the symptoms described in this case.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, as well as the location and size of the mass, the most likely diagnosis is pheochromocytoma.

**Answer**:B. Obtain a biopsy of the lesion for pathology

The correct answer is B. Obtain a biopsy of the lesion for pathology because it is the most appropriate step to determine the cause of the persistent red crusted plaque on the patient's back. A biopsy will allow for a histopathological examination of the lesion, which can help identify the underlying condition, such as infection, inflammation, or cancer. This information is essential for determining the appropriate treatment plan.

Option A, completely excise the lesion, including margins, is not the best next step because it is invasive and may not be necessary. Excision should be considered after a biopsy has been performed and the results have been analyzed.

Option C, perform dermatologic ultrasonography of the lesion, may be useful in some cases, but it is not the most appropriate step in this scenario. Dermatologic ultrasonography can help identify skin structures and detect certain skin conditions, but it cannot provide a definitive diagnosis of the underlying cause of the lesion.

Option D, treat with a stronger topical steroid for 2 weeks, may provide some relief for the patient's symptoms, but it is not a definitive solution. Topical steroids can reduce inflammation and itching, but they will not address the underlying cause of the lesion. Moreover, using a stronger topical steroid without a proper diagnosis may lead to adverse effects or mask the symptoms, making it more challenging to diagnose the condition.

Therefore, the best next step is to obtain a biopsy of the lesion for pathology to determine the underlying cause and develop an appropriate treatment plan.

Answer: C. Do nothing for the CT scan findings

Explanation:

The patient's symptoms and lab results suggest that they have Streptococcus viridans endocarditis, which is being treated with systemic antibiotics. The abdominal CT scan reveals an abnormal gallbladder finding, but it is not clear what this finding represents. In this scenario, it would be appropriate to continue managing the patient's endocarditis and not perform any further interventions based on the CT scan findings.

Choice A, broadening coverage with intravenous antibiotics and proceeding with cholecystectomy, may not be necessary at this time as the patient's symptoms and lab results do not suggest a surgical emergency. Additionally, cholecystectomy may not be appropriate for a patient with sepsis and blood loss.

Choice B, continuing intravenous antibiotics and performing endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), may also not be necessary at this time as the patient's symptoms and lab results do not suggest a surgical emergency. Additionally, ERCP may not be appropriate for a patient with sepsis and blood loss.

Choice D, performing celiotomy and enterotomy with gallstone extraction, is not appropriate as it is a more invasive procedure that may not be necessary based on the patient's symptoms and lab results.

Therefore, the best answer is C, do nothing for the CT scan findings, as it is not clear what the abnormal gallbladder finding represents and the patient's management should focus on treating the endocarditis.

The condition typically affects children, and the lesions can occur on any part of the body, including the trunk, limbs, and genital area.

The patient's history of a 2-week duration of pruritic, bullous skin lesions that started on the lower limbs and spread to other parts of the body, along with the presence of superinfected lesions, is consistent with Linear IgA dermatosis. The absence of fever and normal vital parameters also support this diagnosis.

The negative results for anti-transglutaminase and antiendomysial antibodies, which are commonly used to diagnose autoimmune skin conditions such as pemphigus and herpetiform dermatitis, also support the diagnosis of Linear IgA dermatosis.

The other answer choices are less likely diagnoses for the patient's condition:

A. Herpetiform dermatitis: This is a rare autoimmune skin condition characterized by the formation of small, intensely pruritic vesicles that occur in a grouped or herpetiform pattern. While herpetiform dermatitis can cause bullous lesions, the size and distribution of the lesions in the patient's case are not consistent with this diagnosis.

B. Pemphigus: This is a group of autoimmune skin conditions characterized by the formation of blisters and sores on the skin. While pemphigus can cause large, tense bullae, the patient's history of a 2-week duration of symptoms and the absence of mucosal involvement are not consistent with this diagnosis.

D. Erythema multiforme: This is a skin condition characterized by the formation of red, raised patches on the skin that can be caused by a variety of factors, including infection, medication, and autoimmune disorders. While erythema mult

**Answer**: C. Spontaneous rupture of the spleen

The patient's symptoms of severe abdominal pain, distended abdomen, and diffused peritoneal signs are consistent with a splenic injury. The patient's history of a recent viral illness and absence of trauma suggest a spontaneous rupture of the spleen, which is a rare complication of viral infections.

The ultrasonography image shows a large, hypoechoic lesion in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, which is consistent with a splenic rupture. The absence of any other masses or lesions in the abdomen supports the diagnosis of a spontaneous rupture of the spleen.

Now, let's discuss why the other answer choices are incorrect:

A. Splenic artery aneurysm rupture: While a splenic artery aneurysm rupture can cause similar symptoms, it is unlikely in this case due to the patient's young age and lack of any underlying medical conditions. Additionally, the ultrasonography image does not show any evidence of an aneurysm.

B. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma with associated hepatosplenomegaly: Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can cause splenomegaly, but it is unlikely in this case due to the patient's young age and lack of any other symptoms or signs of lymphoma. Additionally, the ultrasonography image does not show any evidence of a mass or enlargement of the spleen.

D. Pancreatitis with fluid collection: Pancreatitis can cause abdominal pain and distension, but it is unlikely in this case due to the absence of any other symptoms or signs of pancreatitis, such as nausea, vomiting, or abdominal tenderness. Additionally, the ultrasonography image does not show any evidence of pancreatic inflammation or fluid collection.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, medical history, and ultrasonography findings, the most likely diagnosis is a spontaneous rupture of the s

**Answer**: B. Acute appendiceal diverticulitis

The correct answer is B, Acute appendiceal diverticulitis, because the patient's symptoms and imaging findings are consistent with this diagnosis.

Acute appendiceal diverticulitis is a condition where the diverticulum, a small pouch-like structure that forms in the wall of the appendix, becomes inflamed and infected. This can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, fever, and nausea, which are consistent with the patient's presentation.

The imaging findings also support this diagnosis. The ultrasonographic image (Figure A) shows a thickened wall outpouching arising from the vermiform appendix, which is consistent with a diverticulum. The computed tomographic image (Figure B) shows a similar outpouching, as well as inflammatory changes in the surrounding mesenteric fat. These findings are consistent with acute appendiceal diverticulitis.

The gross findings of the excised appendix (Figure C) also support this diagnosis, showing an inflamed wall outpouching and mesenteric fat.

In contrast, the other answer choices do not accurately reflect the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.

A, Acute appendicitis with colon diverticula, is an incorrect choice because the patient's symptoms and imaging findings do not suggest appendicitis. While the patient does have right-sided colonic diverticulosis, this is not the cause of their symptoms.

C, Appendiceal diverticulum, is also an incorrect choice because it does not take into account the patient's symptoms or imaging findings. While the patient does have a diverticulum, it is not the cause of their symptoms.

D, Appendiceal mucocele, is an incorrect choice because it is a rare condition that is not supported by the patient's symptoms or imaging findings.

Therefore, the correct answer is B, Acute appendiceal diverticulitis.

**Answer**: D. Perform a biopsy of a skin lesion for pathologic evaluation

Explanation:

A. Order a computed tomography scan of the lower extremities: While a CT scan may be useful in evaluating the extent of the necrotic lesions and assessing for any underlying muscle or bone damage, it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a cutaneous process, and a skin biopsy would be a more appropriate way to establish a diagnosis.

B. Order a urine toxicology screen to check for cocaine use: The patient's history of ovarian cancer and recent chemotherapy suggests that the necrotic lesions are more likely related to a chemotherapy-induced side effect or a paraneoplastic syndrome rather than drug use. Therefore, a urine toxicology screen would not be the most appropriate next step.

C. Order an ultrasound of the lower extremities: An ultrasound may be useful in evaluating the blood flow to the lower extremities, but it would not provide a definitive diagnosis for the necrotic lesions. A skin biopsy would be a more appropriate next step to establish a diagnosis.

D. Perform a biopsy of a skin lesion for pathologic evaluation: A skin biopsy would provide a definitive diagnosis for the necrotic lesions and help guide further management. The patient's history of ovarian cancer and recent chemotherapy suggests that the necrotic lesions may be related to a chemotherapy-induced side effect or a paraneoplastic syndrome, and a skin biopsy would help to confirm this suspicion.

**Answer**: D. Obtain a skin biopsy from the pustules

Explanation:

A. Do nothing; the rash usually resolves over time - This option is incorrect because the patient's symptoms have been present for a month and have not resolved on their own. Additionally, the patient's cancer treatment with erlotinib may be contributing to the scalp pustules, and ignoring them could lead to further complications.

B. Obtain a bacterial culture from the pustules - This option is incorrect because there is no indication of bacterial infection in the patient's symptoms. The pustules are likely a result of the cancer treatment and not an infection.

C. Obtain a Tzanck smear from the pustules - This option is incorrect because a Tzanck smear is a test used to diagnose herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. There is no indication of HSV infection in the patient's symptoms.

D. Obtain a skin biopsy from the pustules - This option is correct because it will allow for a histopathological examination of the scalp lesions, which can help in diagnosing the cause of the pustules. It may also help in ruling out other conditions such as folliculitis, furuncles, or carbuncles. A skin biopsy can also help in identifying any cancerous cells that may have spread to the skin.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Obtain a skin biopsy from the pustules.

**Answer**: D. Perform rapid direct fluorescence antibody testing from a vesicle

**Explanation**:
The correct answer is D, Perform rapid direct fluorescence antibody testing from a vesicle, because it is the most appropriate step to diagnose the cause of the vesicular rash in the 4-day-old neonate.

 option A, Administer broad-spectrum antibiotics, is not the correct answer because the patient does not have any signs of bacterial infection, such as fever, tachycardia, or tachypnea. Additionally, broad-spectrum antibiotics may not be effective against viral infections, which are a common cause of vesicular rashes in neonates.

 option B, Do nothing; the lesions will resolve spontaneously, is not the correct answer because the rash may not resolve on its own and may require further evaluation and treatment. It is important to determine the cause of the rash to ensure appropriate management and prevent complications.

 option C, Obtain a skin biopsy of a vesicle for pathologic evaluation, may be necessary if the rapid direct fluorescence antibody testing is negative or inconclusive. However, performing a skin biopsy without first doing a rapid test may not be the most appropriate step, as it may not provide a definitive diagnosis and may be unnecessary if the rapid test is positive.

 Therefore, the correct answer is D, Perform rapid direct fluorescence antibody testing from a vesicle, as it is a quick and non-invasive way to diagnose the cause of the vesicular rash and guide further management.

D. Obtain a detailed list of the patient’s medications
The correct answer is D. Obtain a detailed list of the patient’s medications. The patient's sudden onset of blurred vision and frontal headache, along with the physical examination findings of shallow anterior chambers and closed angles on gonioscopy, suggest the possibility of acute bilateral angle closure glaucoma. This is a medical emergency that requires prompt treatment to prevent permanent vision loss.

The other answer choices are not appropriate for the following reasons:

A. Administer a miotic agent (ie, pilocarpine): Miotics are used to treat open-angle glaucoma by increasing aqueous outflow. However, in acute angle closure glaucoma, the angles are already closed, and miotics would not be effective in reducing intraocular pressure.

B. Proceed directly to choroidal drainage sclerotomy: Choroidal drainage sclerotomy is a surgical procedure that is used to treat advanced cases of glaucoma that have not responded to other treatments. It is not appropriate in this case because the patient has not had a thorough evaluation, and there are other, less invasive treatment options available.

C. Perform laser peripheral iridotomy: Laser peripheral iridotomy is a procedure that is used to treat angle-closure glaucoma by creating a hole in the iris to improve aqueous outflow. However, in acute angle closure glaucoma, the iris is already pushed forward, and laser peripheral iridotomy may not be effective in reducing intraocular pressure.

Therefore, the best course of action is to obtain a detailed list of the patient's medications to determine if there is a possible association between the medication and the development of acute angle closure glaucoma. This information will be important in determining the appropriate treatment plan for the patient.

**Answer**: C. Virus-associated trichodysplasia spinulosa

The correct answer is C. Virus-associated trichodysplasia spinulosa because it matches the symptoms described in the question. Trichodysplasia spinulosa is a rare skin condition characterized by the growth of small, spiny, follicular papules on the skin, particularly on the face, trunk, and extremities. The condition is associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.

The patient's symptoms, as described in the question, include the growth of multiple tiny, spiny, follicular hyperkeratotic papules on the face and to a lesser extent on the trunk and extremities. The patient also experienced alopecia involving the eyebrows and eyelashes. These symptoms are consistent with the characteristics of trichodysplasia spinulosa.

The microscopy analysis of the punch biopsy specimen also revealed abnormal maturation of anagen hair follicles with excessive inner root sheath differentiation, which is consistent with the histopathological features of trichodysplasia spinulosa.

In contrast, the other answer choices do not match the patient's symptoms or the histopathological features of the condition.

A. Keratosis pilaris is a common skin condition characterized by the growth of small, rough, scaly papules on the skin, particularly on the face, arms, and legs. It is caused by the buildup of keratin, a protein that protects the skin, and is not associated with HPV infection.

B. Filiform verrucae are small, thread-like warts that can appear on the skin, particularly on the face, neck, and extremities. They are caused by HPV infection, but they do not have the same spiny, follicular appearance as trichodysplasia spinulosa.

**Answer**: D. Gallbladder volvulus

The correct answer is D. Gallbladder volvulus, as the patient's symptoms and ultrasound findings suggest a twisting of the gallbladder, which can cause acute abdominal pain and tenderness. The patient's age and presence of acute tenderness to palpation also support this diagnosis.

Let's go through each of the answer choices in detail:

A. Acute cholecystitis: Acute cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder, usually caused by a gallstone blocking the cystic duct. While this diagnosis may seem likely given the patient's symptoms, the ultrasound findings do not support it. Acute cholecystitis typically appears as a thickened, edematous gallbladder wall with increased echo density, which is not seen in the patient's ultrasound.

B. Gallbladder polyp: A gallbladder polyp is a growth that protrudes from the lining of the gallbladder. While it can cause abdominal pain, it is not typically associated with acute tenderness to palpation or nausea and vomiting, as seen in this patient. Additionally, the ultrasound findings do not suggest a polyp.

C. Gallbladder cancer: Gallbladder cancer is a rare condition that can cause abdominal pain, but it typically presents with more widespread symptoms, such as weight loss, fever, and jaundice. The patient's symptoms and ultrasound findings do not suggest cancer.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Gallbladder volvulus, as it best fits the patient's symptoms and ultrasound findings.

**Answer**:C. Perform laparoscopic appendectomy

The correct answer is C. Perform laparoscopic appendectomy because the patient's symptoms and CT scan findings suggest acute appendicitis. The patient's constant mid-epigastric and supraumbilical abdominal pain, tenderness to palpation in the lower abdomen, and positive psoas sign are all consistent with appendicitis. Additionally, the CT scan shows an inflamed appendix with a surrounding inflammatory mass, which is consistent with acute appendicitis.

Option A, admitting the patient for observation, may be appropriate for patients with milder symptoms or uncertain diagnoses, but it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient given the severity of their symptoms and the definitive CT scan findings.

Option B, initiating broad-spectrum antibiotics and serial abdominal examinations, may be appropriate for patients with suspected appendicitis who are being monitored for signs of progression, but it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient given the definitive CT scan findings and the patient's severe symptoms.

Option D, obtaining an abdominal ultrasound, may be appropriate for patients with uncertain diagnoses or mild symptoms, but it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient given the definitive CT scan findings and the patient's severe symptoms.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to perform a laparoscopic appendectomy to treat the patient's acute appendicitis.

**Answer**:B. Proceed with expectant treatment over the next few months

Explanation:

The correct answer is B, Proceed with expectant treatment over the next few months, because the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest an inguinal hernia, which can be managed conservatively with expectant treatment. The patient's age, medical history, and absence of other symptoms such as fever or chills also support this approach.

Option A, Perform emergency laparoscopy, is not the best choice because the patient's symptoms do not indicate an emergency situation, and a laparoscopy may not be necessary at this point. Additionally, the patient's age and medical history suggest that a more conservative approach may be more appropriate.

Option C, Treat with oral acyclovir, is not relevant to the patient's current condition, as acyclovir is used to treat herpes zoster, which the patient has already been diagnosed with and has been managed with antiviral agents.

Option D, Request a lower gastrointestinal series, is not necessary at this point, as the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest an inguinal hernia, which can be managed conservatively. A lower gastrointestinal series may be considered if the patient's symptoms persist or worsen over time, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case.

**Answer**: D. Perform flexible bronchoscopy

The patient's symptoms of a persistent dry cough and the presence of a foreign body in the right side of the chest, as revealed by the chest radiograph and CT scan, suggest that the foreign body may have entered the tracheobronchial tree. Flexible bronchoscopy is the appropriate next step in the management of this patient. It allows for visualization of the airways and removal of the foreign body, which is likely to be a bullet fragment.

Option A, locally exploring the mandibular wound, is not necessary at this point, as the foreign body is already visible on imaging and the patient's symptoms suggest that it is causing an airway obstruction.

Option B, performing angiography, is not indicated in this case, as there is no evidence of vascular injury or bleeding.

Option C, performing a thoracotomy to remove the foreign body, is a more invasive procedure that may be necessary if the foreign body cannot be removed through bronchoscopy. However, it is not the most appropriate next step, as it carries a higher risk of complications and may not be necessary if the foreign body can be removed through bronchoscopy.

**Answer**: D. Photocoagulation

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of "lines across my vision" and photopsias in the right eye, along with the physical examination findings of a clear vitreous and the presence of a vitreous floaters, are consistent with a diagnosis of vitreous opacification. Vitreous opacification can be caused by a variety of factors, including inflammation, hemorrhage, and tumors. In this case, the presence of a vitreous floater suggests that the opacification is likely due to a benign vitreous floaters.

Photocoagulation is a treatment option for vitreous opacification that is caused by benign vitreous floaters. Photocoagulation uses a laser to create a grid of small burns in the vitreous, which helps to break up the floaters and improve vision. This treatment is usually performed on an outpatient basis and has a good success rate in improving vision.

The other options are not appropriate for this patient's condition. Pars plana vitrectomy is a surgical procedure that involves removing the vitreous gel and replacing it with a gas or oil bubble. This procedure is usually reserved for more severe cases of vitreous opacification that do not respond to photocoagulation or in cases where there is a risk of retinal detachment.

Systemic antihelmintic therapy is not indicated in this case, as there is no evidence of a parasitic infection. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest the presence of a parasitic infection, and there is no history of recent travel or abnormal exposures to suggest a risk of infection.

Ordering urgent serum titers of IgG and IgM for Ancylostoma caninum and Baylisascaris procyonis is also not indicated in this case, as there is no evidence of a parasitic infection. While it is possible that the patient could have a parasitic infection, the symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest this diagnosis, and there is no history of recent travel or abnormal exposures to suggest a risk of infection.

Therefore, the best answer is D.

The correct diagnosis is D. Rickettsialpox, as it best fits the patient's symptoms and clinical findings.

A. Disseminated herpes simplex: This is an unlikely diagnosis as the patient does not have the characteristic symptoms of herpes simplex, such as grouped vesicles or ulcers, and the rash is not typical of herpes simplex.

B. Primary varicella: This is also an unlikely diagnosis as the patient has already had chickenpox, which is highly unlikely in a 7-month-old infant.

C. Staphylococcal pustulosis: This diagnosis is unlikely as the patient does not have the characteristic signs of staphylococcal pustulosis, such as pustules or crusted lesions, and there is no evidence of bacterial colonization.

D. Rickettsialpox: This is the most likely diagnosis as it is consistent with the patient's symptoms, including fever, rash, and mild leukopenia. The presence of pink papulovesicles with hemorrhagic crust and the histopathologic findings of a relatively dense and diffuse perivascular and interstitial dermal infiltrate of predominantly mononuclear cells and a few neutrophils, with changes indicative of mild vasculitis, are also consistent with rickettsialpox. The patient's recent travel history and exposure to ticks also increase the likelihood of this diagnosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is D. Rickettsialpox.

The patient's symptoms of fever, nausea, arthralgias, and cough, along with the laboratory results of a white blood cell count of 2700/μL, a lactic acid level of 19.8 mg/dL, and a platelet count of 72×103/μL, suggest a systemic infection. The urinalysis showing trace blood, positive nitrite, +1 leukocyte esterase, and a white blood cell count of 2000/μL to 5000/μL, and the positive blood culture for Enterobacter sakazakii (now known as Cronobacter sakazakii), support the diagnosis of bacteremia. The patient's history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, chronic diarrhea, myelodysplastic syndrome treated with chemotherapy, and Behçet syndrome treated with prednisone acetate, may also suggest a compromised immune system, which could increase the risk of infection.

The computed tomographic scan of the abdomen/pelvis with contrast (Figure 1) shows a possible connection between the gallbladder and the colon, which could be indicative of a cholecystocolonic fistula. This would explain the presence of bacteremia and the patient's symptoms.

Cholecystocolonic fistula is a rare condition that occurs when there is a communication between the gallbladder and the colon. It can be caused by various factors, such as inflammatory bowel disease, gallstones, or malignancy. In this case, the patient's history of recurrent right-sided diverticulitis and previous right-sided hemicolectomy may have contributed to the development of the fistula.

Perforated bowel (choice A) is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, as there is no evidence of peritonitis or abdominal pain. Crohn disease (choice B) is also unlikely, as the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not suggest inflammatory bowel disease.

**Answer**:A. Exophytic solitary giant cavernous hemangioma of stomach

The correct answer is A, Exophytic solitary giant cavernous hemangioma of stomach, because it matches the symptoms and findings described in the case.

A cavernous hemangioma is a type of vascular malformation that is composed of enlarged blood vessels and is usually benign. It can occur in various parts of the body, including the stomach. An exophytic hemangioma is a type of cavernous hemangioma that grows outward from the surface of the organ, which is consistent with the description of the mass in the case.

The patient's symptoms of abdominal distention and a dragging type of discomfort are consistent with the presence of a large mass in the abdomen. The fact that the mass was irregular in shape and not tender to palpation suggests that it was not a simple cyst or abscess. The absence of any bruit or other vascular anomalies on systemic examination also supports the diagnosis of a cavernous hemangioma.

The nonenhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed a partially well-circumscribed, mixed cystic and solitary mass that partially enveloped the stomach and compressed adjacent organs, which is consistent with the description of an exophytic cavernous hemangioma. The fact that the mass was not enhancing on CT scan suggests that it was not a malignant tumor.

The other answer choices do not fit the case as well as choice A.

B, Complicated cyst, does not explain the irregular shape and lack of tenderness of the mass.

C, Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST), is a type of malignant tumor that can occur in the stomach, but it typically presents with symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, and would be unlikely to cause abdominal distention and a dragging sensation.

**Answer**: D. Recommend esophageal resection

The patient's symptoms of severe postprandial chest pain and odynophagia, along with the findings of food stasis throughout the esophagus, large diverticula in the lower esophagus, and extensive candidiasis, suggest a diagnosis of esophageal motility disorder. The patient's history of lumbar spine surgery and chronic back pain leading to continued requirement for opiate analgesia also suggests that the patient may have developed a dependence on opioids, which could be contributing to the symptoms.

Option A, treating the patient with analgesia and nutritional support, may provide some symptomatic relief, but it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

Option B, treating the patient with calcium channel antagonists, may be effective in treating the patient's hypertensive propagated pressure waves in the distal esophagus, but it does not address the underlying motility disorder.

Option C, recommending an extended esophageal myotomy, may be effective in treating the patient's motility disorder, but it is not the most appropriate option given the patient's history of lumbar spine surgery and chronic back pain.

Option D, recommending esophageal resection, is the most appropriate option as it addresses the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, which is the motility disorder, and it is a more definitive treatment option compared to the other choices.

**Answer**:C. Immunohistochemical testing

The correct answer is C. Immunohistochemical testing.

Immunohistochemical testing is a technique used to detect the presence of specific proteins or antigens in tissue samples. In this case, it would be useful to identify the specific types of inflammatory cells infiltrating the dermis and to assess their phenotype. The presence of numerous foamy histiocytoid cells and multinucleated cells in the biopsy suggests that there may be an abnormal immune response or a neoplastic process occurring in the skin. Immunohistochemical testing can help to clarify the nature of these cells and guide further management.

Acid-fast staining (choice A) is a technique used to detect the presence of mycobacteria in tissue samples. While mycobacterial infections can cause skin lesions, the absence of any relevant medical history and the lack of other symptoms suggest that this is unlikely in this case.

Immunoelectron microscopy (choice B) is a technique used to study the ultrastructure of cells and tissues. While it may be useful in certain cases, it is not the most appropriate choice in this scenario.

PAS (periodic acid–Schiff) staining (choice D) is a technique used to detect the presence of glycogen and other carbohydrates in tissue samples. While it may be useful in certain cases, it is not the most appropriate choice in this scenario.

Therefore, the best answer is C. Immunohistochemical testing.

**Answer**: C. Hepatic abscess

A hepatic abscess is a collection of pus in the liver, typically caused by bacterial infection. The patient's symptoms of fever, abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, as well as the physical examination findings of mild right upper abdominal quadrant tenderness, are consistent with a hepatic abscess. The laboratory results showing a marked increase in inflammatory markers and the imaging findings of a hypodense, multiloculated lesion on computed tomography and an heterogeneous, capsulated lesion with numerous septa delimiting large areas of necrosis on magnetic resonance imaging, are also consistent with a hepatic abscess.

In contrast, choice A, hydatid cyst, is a parasitic infection caused by the larval form of the dog tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus. While hydatid cysts can cause similar symptoms, they typically have a different imaging appearance, with a characteristic "target sign" or "ring-like" structure. The patient's negative serological test result for echinococcosis and the absence of any history of exposure to dogs or sheep also make this diagnosis less likely.

Choice B, infected biliary cystadenoma, is a rare condition that typically presents with symptoms of biliary obstruction, such as jaundice, itching, and abdominal pain. While the patient's symptoms could be consistent with this diagnosis, the imaging findings do not support it, as the lesion is not located in the biliary tree and does not have the characteristic features of a biliary cystadenoma.

Choice D, inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver, is a rare benign tumor-like lesion that can mimic a malignant tumor. While the patient's symptoms and laboratory results could be consistent with this diagnosis, the imaging findings do not support it, as the lesion is not typically capsulated or septated, and does not have the characteristic "swirling" or "spiculated" margins.

**Answer**:C. Primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) with multiple brown tumors

The correct answer is C. Primary hyperparathyroidism (pHPT) with multiple brown tumors, as it best fits the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

A. Malignant bone tumor: This choice is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not suggest a malignant bone tumor. The patient's age and lack of a family history of bone cancer, along with the absence of any abnormalities on physical examination, make it less likely that the patient has a malignant bone tumor. Additionally, the radiographic and MRI findings do not support this diagnosis, as the lesions are cystic and nonsclerotic, and there is no evidence of bone destruction or soft tissue mass.

B. Aneurysmatic bone cyst: This choice is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not suggest an aneurysmatic bone cyst. While the patient's symptoms of pain after a tap on the knee may be consistent with an aneurysmatic bone cyst, the radiographic and MRI findings do not support this diagnosis. The lesions are not expansile or multilocular, and there is no evidence of bone destruction or soft tissue mass. Additionally, the patient's age and lack of a family history of bone cancer make it less likely that the patient has an aneurysmatic bone cyst.

D. Giant cell tumor: This choice is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not suggest a giant cell tumor.
