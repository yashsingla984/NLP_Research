**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of intermittent apneic episodes, bilateral rhonchi, and altered mental status are concerning for an aspiration event. The presence of coin-shaped opacities in the stomach on chest radiograph suggests that the patient may have ingested a foreign body, which could be causing the aspiration. It is important to determine the composition of the foreign body to inform further management.

**Answer**: B: Arrange endoscopy. An endoscopy would allow for visualization of the esophagus and stomach to identify any foreign bodies or lesions that may be causing the patient's symptoms. It would also allow for the removal of any foreign bodies that are found.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a neurological disorder affecting the right side of the face and head, including facial weakness and numbness, vision changes, and headaches. The patient's history of a previous melanoma and numerous other skin cancers raises the possibility of a malignancy affecting the nervous system. The absence of other neurological abnormalities and the normal initial MRI suggest a possible diagnosis of Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, a rare condition characterized by unilateral painful ophthalmoplegia and cranial nerve palsies caused by inflammation of the cavernous sinus. However, the patient's history of skin malignancies and the presence of periorbital headaches suggest that the condition may be related to perineural spread of cutaneous malignancy. A biopsy of the affected nerve is needed to confirm the diagnosis.

Sure, I'll do my best to answer your question. Here's my reasoning and answer:

**Reasoning**:
The patient presents with symptoms of fever, hemoptysis, and syncopal episodes, which suggest a potential cardiac arrhythmia. The electrocardiogram (ECG) shows monomorphic ventricular tachycardia with a morphology suggesting right ventricular (RV) origin. The patient has a history of breast cancer and pulmonary nodules, which increases the likelihood of a cardiac arrhythmia. Additionally, the patient has severe RV and left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction, which further supports the need for further cardiac evaluation.

**Answer**: B: Electrophysiology study.

An electrophysiology study (EPS) would be the next appropriate step in managing this patient's condition. An EPS is a diagnostic test that helps to identify the origin and mechanism of the arrhythmia. It can also help to determine the best course of treatment, which may include medication, cardioversion, or catheter ablation. In this case, an EPS would help to confirm the diagnosis of ventricular tachycardia and determine the optimal treatment strategy.

Please let me know if you have any further questions or if there's anything else I can help with.

Sure, I'll do my best to provide a well-structured answer. Here's my reasoning and answer:

**Reasoning**:
The patient presents with a pigmented iris lesion that is shifting with gravity, which suggests that it is likely a cystic lesion. The absence of corneal guttatae or edema suggests that the lesion is not causing significant inflammation or fluid accumulation in the eye. The patient's age and history of sports-related blunt trauma suggest that the lesion may be related to a previous injury.

Given these findings, the next step would be to perform a diagnostic test to further evaluate the nature of the lesion. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy with cytology and cytogenetics (Option A) would be the most appropriate choice, as it would allow for a definitive diagnosis of the lesion and help guide further management.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with a possible choroidal melanoma. However, the lack of pigmentation and elevation of the lesion, along with the patient's history of macular degeneration and retinal detachment, suggest that the lesion may be an amelanotic fundus lesion. Additionally, the MRI findings of a hypointense circumferential band and a hyperintense nodular mass are consistent with a choroidal melanoma. Therefore, to further evaluate the lesion and determine the appropriate treatment, the next step would be to perform a fine-needle aspiration biopsy.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of uveitis, specifically juvenile idiopathic arthritis-related uveitis. The presence of a macular star, optic disc edema, and retinal vein dilation suggest inflammation in the eye. The patient's history of recurrent urinary tract infections and recent mild fever and flulike symptoms also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the presence of hypopigmented dots in the retinal pigment epithelium suggests possible previous inflammation.

**Answer**: B: Order serologic testing for infectious neuroretinitis.

The next step would be to order serologic testing to confirm the diagnosis of uveitis and to rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, such as infectious neuroretinitis. Corticosteroids may be prescribed later to treat the inflammation, but first, it is important to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes. A brain tumor is unlikely given the patient's age and symptoms, and there is no evidence to suggest hypertension is a concern.

**Reasoning**: The patient's history of a similar episode of rash and delayed wound healing after laparoscopy 1 year prior to presentation, along with the negative bacterial culture result, suggests that the current rash and poor wound healing may be related to an allergic or immune-mediated response rather than a bacterial infection. Additionally, the presence of a papulovesicular rash on the trunk and extremities suggests a possible viral exanthemata, such as herpes zoster or herpes simplex.

**Answer**: B: Prescribe acyclovir (400 mg orally 3 times daily for 7 days). Acyclovir is an antiviral medication that is effective against herpes simplex and herpes zoster viruses. It may help to reduce the severity and duration of the rash, promote wound healing, and prevent further episodes of rash and delayed wound healing.

**Reasoning**:
The patient presented with a red, protuberant tumor on her right upper arm that had been gradually enlarging over 6 months. The tumor had a hard nodule inside and was accompanied by a nontender, firm-to-hard nodule. The patient had no history of local trauma or insect bite. On physical examination, there was no regional lymphadenopathy, and the results of the rest of the physical and systemic examinations were normal. Laboratory examinations of hematologic, biochemical, and urinalysis tests were also normal.

The patient's age and the absence of any remarkable personal, past, or family history suggest that the tumor is unlikely to be a matrical carcinoma (Option A).

Panfolliculoma (Option B) is a benign tumor that arises from the follicular infundibulum. It typically appears as a small, flesh-colored or pink papule on the face, neck, or upper torso. The patient's tumor is larger and has a different appearance, making panfolliculoma an unlikely diagnosis.

Bullous pilomatricoma (Option C) is a rare benign tumor that arises from the hair matrix. It typically presents as a rapidly growing, painless nodule or tumor on the scalp, face, or neck. The patient's tumor does not have the characteristic appearance of a pilomatricoma, and the absence of a history of rapid growth makes this diagnosis unlikely.

Trichodiscoma (Option D) is a rare benign tumor that arises from the hair follicle. It typically presents as a small, flesh-colored or pink papule on the scalp, eyebrow, or eyelashes. The patient's tumor is larger and has a different appearance, making trichodiscoma an unlikely diagnosis.

**Answer**: B, Panfolliculoma.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms and examination findings are concerning for a retinal astrocytic hamartoma, which is a type of benign tumor that can occur in the retina. The presence of associated intraretinal hemorrhages and exudates, as well as the abnormal fluorescein angiography findings, support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of lightly pigmented patches of skin and subungual fibromas on her toes suggests that she may have tuberous sclerosis complex, a genetic disorder that can cause various types of non-cancerous tumors, including retinal astrocytic hamartomas. It is important to rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a retinal vein occlusion or diabetic retinopathy, which can also cause macular edema and hemorrhages. However, given the patient's history and examination findings, a retinal astrocytic hamartoma is the most likely diagnosis.

**Answer**: B: Order brain magnetic resonance imaging to look for associated central nervous system tumors.

It is important to note that while the patient's symptoms and examination findings are concerning for a retinal astrocytic hamartoma, a definitive diagnosis cannot be made without further testing. Imaging studies, such as MRI or CT scans, may be necessary to confirm the presence of a hamartoma and to rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms. Additionally, genetic testing may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis complex.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of acute cerebellar ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and bilateral mydriasis, along with the physical examination findings of brisk reflexes, poor coordination, and wide-based unsteady gait, are concerning for a possible autoimmune or inflammatory condition affecting the nervous system. The patient's recent upper respiratory symptoms and conjunctivitis treated with topical ofloxacin may suggest a possible viral or bacterial infection triggering an autoimmune response. The patient's age and presentation of bilateral mydriasis also raise concern for a possible autoimmune disorder such as Miller Fisher syndrome or Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis. Therefore, it is important to investigate further for evidence of autoimmune or inflammatory disease affecting the nervous system.

**Answer**: C: Order anti-GQ1b antibody and start intravenous immune globulin. This answer choice is appropriate because anti-GQ1b antibody is commonly associated with Miller Fisher syndrome and Bickerstaff brainstem encephalitis, and intravenous immune globulin is a common treatment for these conditions. Additionally, the patient's symptoms of acute cerebellar ataxia, ophthalmoplegia, and bilateral mydriasis are consistent with these conditions.

**Reasoning**: The patient's history of a gradually growing mass on the left shoulder, along with the physical examination findings of a large, fungating, necrotic, and ulcerated mass, suggests a malignant skin lesion. The patient's occupation as a construction worker and daily tobacco use may also contribute to the development of skin cancer. The punch biopsy results showing sheets of highly pleomorphic atypical spindle and epithelial cells within the superficial and deep dermis, extending into the subcutaneous tissue, and with 18 mitoses/mm2, further supports the diagnosis of a high-grade malignancy. Additionally, the immunohistochemistry results demonstrating SOX10-positive and pankeratin-negative tumor cells, are consistent with a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma. Finally, the PET-CT scan showing an intensely hypermetabolic left shoulder mass and multiple hypermetabolic enlarged left axillary lymph nodes, without any distant metastases, suggests that the cancer is locally advanced.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with retinal vasculitis and vitritis, which can be caused by various inflammatory conditions, including infections. The presence of pigmented cells in the anterior chamber and lens capsule, as well as the sheets of pigmented cells and vascular sheathing in the fundus, suggest a possible infectious etiology. The recent initiation of cabozantinib therapy and the negative result of vitreous biopsy cytology suggest that the retinal detachment may be related to the drug. The patient's history of B-cell lymphoma and active RCC increases the likelihood of an underlying inflammatory or infectious condition.

**Answer**: B: Stop prednisone and proceed with diagnostic vitrectomy.

A diagnostic vitrectomy would allow for a more thorough evaluation of the vitreous and retinal tissue to determine the underlying cause of the retinal vasculitis and vitritis. It would also allow for the removal of any inflammatory or infectious material that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. Stopping prednisone would allow for a more accurate assessment of the patient's response to treatment and reduce the risk of steroid-induced complications. Cabozantinib therapy should be stopped because it may be contributing to the retinal detachment, and intravenous solumedrol may be considered for the patient's active RCC. Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits and lumbar puncture may also be considered to evaluate for any central nervous system involvement.

**Reasoning**: The patient presents with acute chest pain and symptoms consistent with myocardial ischemia, and the electrocardiogram (ECG) shows ST-segment elevation and premature ventricular contractions, which suggest an acute coronary event. The cardiac point-of-care ultrasonography demonstrates a severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and hypokinesis of the anterolateral and posterior walls, which further support the diagnosis of myocardial ischemia. The emergent cardiac catheterization reveals spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) of the left main coronary artery. Given these findings, the next step would be to treat the patient's myocardial ischemia and SCAD.

**Reasoning**: The patient presented with progressive skin laxity, which worsened with developmental growth, and yellowish papules on the dorsal neck. The patient's younger sister also had similar skin symptoms, suggesting a possible genetic disorder. The patient had a low clotting activity of factor X and a prolonged prothrombin time, indicating a coagulation deficiency. The skin biopsy showed excessive calcification of elastic fiber fragments in the reticular dermis, which is consistent with pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE). However, the patient's symptoms are more severe than typical PXE, and the presence of coagulation deficiency suggests a possible overlap syndrome.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms, including skin lesions, numbness, and hand contractures, are consistent with Hansen's disease, also known as leprosy. The fact that the patient is from Samoa, where Hansen's disease is endemic, further supports this diagnosis. A negative rapid plasma reagin test and negative acid-fast bacilli stains do not rule out Hansen's disease, as the bacteria can be difficult to detect in skin biopsies. The patient's age and lack of exposure to herbal supplements or medications also make Hansen's disease more likely.
**Answer**: C: Send skin biopsy specimen to the US National Hansen’s Disease Program for PCR testing. This is the most appropriate next step in diagnosing and managing the patient's condition. PCR testing can confirm the presence of Mycobacterium leprae DNA in the skin biopsy specimen, which would support the diagnosis of Hansen's disease.

Sure, I can do that. Here's my answer:

**Reasoning**: The patient's presentation of chest pain, shortness of breath, and bilateral lower extremity numbness, along with the electrocardiogram (ECG), echocardiogram, and bone scintigraphy results, suggest the possibility of a cardiac condition, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). HCM is a genetic disorder that can cause left ventricular hypertrophy, cardiac fibrosis, and arrhythmias. The patient's history of lumbar spinal stenosis increases the likelihood of a neurological component to the patient's symptoms. Additionally, the patient's unintended weight loss and recent onset of neuropathy suggest a possible systemic condition.

**Answer**: B: Order genetic testing.

I chose this answer because genetic testing can help identify genetic mutations associated with HCM and other cardiac conditions. It is an appropriate next step in the patient's diagnostic workup, given the patient's symptoms and test results.

**Reasoning**:
The patient's symptoms of diminution of vision, progressive redness, and dull aching pain in the right eye, along with the physical findings of dilated corkscrew conjunctival vessels, shallow anterior chamber, and serous choroidal detachment, suggest a possible diagnosis of ocular inflammation. The absence of any history of trauma and the patient's unremarkable medical history suggest that the inflammation is likely to be of an inflammatory nature. Additionally, the presence of a large choroidal detachment nasally and shallow detachment all around suggests a possible diagnosis of serous choroidal detachment.

**Answer**: B: Uveitis workup and steroids.

I choose this answer because the patient's symptoms and physical findings suggest a possible diagnosis of ocular inflammation, and a workup for uveitis and possible treatment with steroids would be appropriate to manage the inflammation and prevent further vision loss.

Sure, I'll do my best to help you with that! Here's my reasoning and answer:

**Reasoning**: Based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings, it seems like she has developed an unusual spontaneous acute deepening of the anterior chamber, possibly related to anterior uveitis and posterior synechiae. This has led to a decrease in her visual acuity and an inferior retinal detachment. Given the presence of a cortical and nuclear cataract, it's important to address the cataract and the anterior chamber deepening to improve her vision.

**Answer**: B: Perform full-thickness sclerectomy.

In this case, I would recommend performing a full-thickness sclerectomy to address the deepening of the anterior chamber and the posterior synechiae. This procedure involves creating a full-thickness incision in the sclera to allow the aqueous humor to drain and relieve the pressure in the anterior chamber. Additionally, it allows for the removal of the cataract and the opportunity to inspect the retina for any tears or retinal pathology.

Performing a peripheral iridotomy (Option A) may be necessary as well, but it would not address the underlying cause of the deepening anterior chamber. Administering intravenous corticosteroids (Option C) may help reduce inflammation, but it would not necessarily address the mechanical issue causing the deepening anterior chamber. Scheduling combined phacoemulsification-vitrectomy surgery (Option D) may also be necessary, but it would not address the acute deepening of the anterior chamber and may not be necessary if the patient's vision can be improved with less invasive measures.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of decreased visual acuity, bilateral panuveitis, and pigmentary abnormalities on fundus examination suggest a possible inflammatory or infectious etiology. The history of stage 3 cutaneous melanoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia increases the likelihood of an underlying systemic condition contributing to the patient's ocular symptoms. The recent exposure to nivolumab and obinutuzumab, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and positive Lyme disease exposure further support the possibility of an immune-related adverse event.

The patient's condition did not improve with oral prednisone therapy, and the recurrence of active anterior and vitreous cells after discontinuing prednisone suggests a possible steroid-resistant or steroid-dependent process. The negative results of repeat testing for Treponema pallidum, Lyme disease, and HIV reduce the likelihood of an active infection.

Given the patient's history of cancer and immune-related adverse events, and the lack of response to steroid therapy, it is reasonable to consider immunomodulatory therapy with another course of oral steroids (Option A) to control the inflammation and prevent further vision loss.

**Answer**: A. Immunomodulatory therapy with another course of oral steroids.

Additionally, the patient's fundus examination reveals papilledema with changes of hypertensive retinopathy, which is also consistent with PRES.

**Answer**: C: Fibromuscular dysplasia.

Fibromuscular dysplasia is a rare condition that affects the blood vessels, particularly the renal arteries. It is characterized by the proliferation of fibromuscular tissue in the arterial walls, leading to stenosis or occlusion of the affected vessels. Renovascular hypertension is a common complication of fibromuscular dysplasia, and PRES is a known complication of renovascular hypertension.

Sure, I'll do my best to provide a well-structured answer. Here's my reasoning and answer:

**Reasoning**:
The patient's black tongue discoloration is an unexpected finding, and it's essential to determine its cause to provide appropriate treatment and prevent any potential complications. The patient's history of recent shoulder surgery, fever, and shoulder pain suggests a possible bacterial or viral infection. However, the patient's lack of symptoms related to the tongue discoloration and no history of smoking, using chewing tobacco, or illicit drugs reduces the likelihood of a nicotine or substance-related cause. The patient's age and recent surgery increase the likelihood of a medication-related side effect or an opportunistic infection.

**Answer**: C: Provide reassurance and prescribe oral care.

I choose option C because the patient's black tongue discoloration is likely a side effect of the antibiotic treatment or an opportunistic infection related to the recent surgery. Providing reassurance and prescribing oral care to maintain good oral hygiene and prevent any further complications is the appropriate next step. It's essential to monitor the patient's condition closely and consider further diagnostic tests, such as a tongue biopsy, if the discoloration persists or worsens over time.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms and examination findings, such as bilateral blurry vision, eye redness, discharge, photophobia, and pain, are consistent with bilateral hypopyon. The patient's history of Leber congenital amaurosis treated with voretigene neparvovec and recent chemotherapy for acute myeloid leukemia increases the likelihood of an infectious etiology. The presence of fibrin and hypopyon in both eyes suggests a bilateral infectious process. The patient's recent chemotherapy and removal of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) increase the risk of infection.

**Answer**: C: Obtain a sample of the hypopyon through anterior chamber paracentesis and inject intravitreal antibiotics. This is the most appropriate next step in management, as it allows for the diagnosis of the underlying infection and prompt treatment to prevent further vision loss.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of alternating vertical and torsional nystagmus, along with the absence of any family history of ocular disease, suggest a possible underlying neurological cause. The patient's history of esophageal atresia, small bowel obstruction, mild cognitive impairment, low tone, and increased reflexes also support this possibility. Furthermore, the normal optic nerve and foveal reflexes, as well as the strong ipsilateral activity of the occipital lobe on flash VEP, suggest that the issue is likely not related to the eyes themselves, but rather to the brain's processing of visual information.

**Answer**: A: Review brain MRI and order electroretinogram.

It would be appropriate to review the patient's brain MRI to look for any abnormalities that may be contributing to the nystagmus. Additionally, an electroretinogram (ERG) could be ordered to assess the function of the retina and rule out any retinal abnormalities that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms.

**Reasoning**: The patient's history of end-stage kidney disease and multiple kidney transplants, along with the visual changes she is experiencing, suggest a possible diagnosis of ocular ischemic syndrome. This is a condition that can occur in patients with systemic vasculitis, such as polyarteritis nodosa, which is a known complication of kidney transplantation. The patient's age and history of smoking also increase her risk for ocular ischemic syndrome.

The absence of central vessels on the left optic disc, as well as the peripherally located blood vessels, are consistent with ocular ischemic syndrome. Additionally, the right optic disc appears dysplastic, which may indicate a congenital or developmental abnormality that could be related to the patient's history of kidney disease.

Therefore, the next step would be to order a cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to further evaluate the patient's brain and orbit for signs of vasculitis or other intracranial causes of ocular ischemia. This would help to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.

**Reasoning**: The patient's presentation of pulmonary edema and bilateral infiltrates on chest radiography, despite adequate diuresis, suggests acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient's history of recent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and administration of amiodarone increases the likelihood of drug-induced lung injury. Additionally, the patient's episodes of supraventricular tachycardia and atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular response suggest that the patient may have developed an arrhythmia-induced cardiac injury.

**Answer**: B: Discontinue amiodarone and administer a corticosteroid.

Discontinuing amiodarone may help to prevent further lung injury and reduce the risk of progression to more severe ARDS. Administering a corticosteroid may help to reduce inflammation and improve lung function. Bronchoalveolar lavage (Option C) may not be necessary at this point, as the patient's clinical presentation and radiographic findings are consistent with ARDS, and lung biopsy (Option A) may not be feasible or necessary in this clinical scenario. Checking amiodarone plasma level (Option D) may not be helpful in this case, as the patient's clinical presentation and radiographic findings suggest drug-induced lung injury, rather than a dosing issue.

**Reasoning**: The patient's presentation of spontaneous blistering on the right lower extremity, hyperpigmented macules, and patches on the anterior lower legs, and tense bullae on the anterior aspect of the right lower extremity, dorsal foot surface, and toes, are consistent with diabetic dermopathy. Diabetic dermopathy is a skin condition that occurs in patients with diabetes and is associated with poor blood sugar control. The patient's history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and gastroparesis, as well as the laboratory results showing a high blood glucose level and hemoglobin A1c level, support the diagnosis. The patient's lack of symptoms such as pruritus or pain, and the absence of surrounding erythema or edema, also suggest diabetic dermopathy.

**Answer**: B: Perform a skin biopsy for histopathology and direct immunofluorescence. A skin biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of diabetic dermopathy and to rule out other potential causes of blistering skin conditions. The biopsy will also help to assess the severity of the condition and guide further management. Direct immunofluorescence can help to identify immune deposits and confirm the diagnosis of diabetic dermopathy.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of unilateral hearing loss and middle ear effusion, along with the presence of a CSF leak, suggest a possible diagnosis of a temporal bone lesion. The imaging findings of a lytic aspect of the right temporal bone extending to the petrous apex and mastoid air cells, with associated soft tissue opacification, are consistent with a destructive process involving the temporal bone. The presence of a hyperintense T2 signal in the petrous apex and mastoid air cells, along with suspected communication into the soft tissues of the right neck, suggests a possible CSF leak. The patient's young age and absence of other symptoms make Gorham-Stout disease a less likely diagnosis. Langerhans cell histiocytosis is also unlikely given the absence of other symptoms and the patient's age. Cholesteatoma is unlikely given the presence of a CSF leak. Sarcoma is a possibility, but the imaging findings do not suggest a typical sarcoma.

**Reasoning**:
The patient's history of long-term hydroxyurea therapy and the clinical presentation of numerous ulcerated plaques on sun-exposed areas suggest a possible adverse effect of the medication. Hydroxyurea is known to cause skin toxicity, including ulcerations, and the patient's cumulative dose of approximately 2500 g over 14 years is within the range associated with this side effect. The patient's history of nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSCa) and previous surgical treatment also increase the likelihood of a skin-related diagnosis.

The histopathologic findings (hematoxylin-eosin stain) shown in Figure D are consistent with hydroxyurea-induced ulcerations, as they demonstrate a lack of rete ridges, a thin epidermis, and a dermal inflammatory infiltrate. These features are consistent with a diagnosis of iatrogenic epidermodysplasia verruciformis, which is a known side effect of long-term hydroxyurea therapy.

Therefore, based on the patient's history, clinical presentation, and histopathologic findings, the most likely diagnosis is iatrogenic epidermodysplasia verruciformis.

**Reasoning**: The patient has a history of recurrent torsade de pointes, a potentially life-threatening arrhythmia. The patient is currently receiving metoprolol succinate, which can exacerbate this condition. Therefore, it is important to consider alternative treatments that may be more effective in managing the patient's arrhythmia.

**Answer**: B: Start intravenous amiodarone. Amiodarone is an anti-arrhythmic drug that is effective in converting torsade de pointes back to normal sinus rhythm. It is also effective in preventing recurrent episodes of torsade de pointes. Intravenous amiodarone is the preferred route of administration in emergency situations like this, as it acts quickly and can be easily titrated to achieve the desired effect.

**Reasoning**: The patient presented with a wide complex tachycardia, which suggests a ventricular arrhythmia. The patient's history of nonspecific T-wave abnormalities on ECG and the recent onset of chest discomfort, diaphoresis, and shortness of breath suggest that the arrhythmia may be related to coronary artery disease. The patient's stable vital signs and normal electrolyte levels suggest that the arrhythmia is not caused by an electrolyte imbalance. The patient's high-sensitivity troponin level suggests that there may be some degree of myocardial damage. The patient's cardiac catheterization revealed patent coronary arteries, which suggests that the arrhythmia is not caused by a blockage in the coronary arteries. The patient's cardiac magnetic resonance imaging showed a dilated right ventricle with moderately reduced systolic function and transmural late gadolinium enhancement with akinesis and dyskinesis involving the right ventricular free wall and outflow tract extending to the left ventricular anterior, septal, and apical segments, which suggests that the arrhythmia may be related to a cardiomyopathy.

**Answer**: C: Transthoracic echocardiogram. A transthoracic echocardiogram would provide further information about the patient's cardiac function and help to confirm the diagnosis of cardiomyopathy. It would also help to identify any other potential causes of the arrhythmia, such as a cardiac tumor or vegetation.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with primary syphilis. The irregular gray-white ulcers with surrounding erythema on the soft palate, uvula, and tonsils are characteristic of primary syphilis. The absence of other symptoms such as sore throat, dysphagia, hoarse voice, cough, dyspnea, nausea, vomiting, headache, fever, night sweats, weight loss, rash, or genital, rectal, or oral ulcers suggests that the patient is in the early stages of the disease. The patient's history of sexual contact with one male partner over the past 6 months increases the likelihood of a sexually transmitted infection. Therefore, it is important to rule out other sexually transmitted infections such as chlamydia and gonorrhea.
**Answer**: B: Perform a biopsy of the gray-white plaque. A biopsy of the plaque will help to confirm the diagnosis of primary syphilis and rule out other possibilities such as oropharyngeal cancer. Additionally, a biopsy will allow for further testing, such as dark field microscopy or PCR, to detect the presence of Treponema pallidum, the bacteria that causes syphilis.

Sure, I'll do my best to provide a well-structured answer. Here's my reasoning and answer:

**Reasoning**:
The patient's symptoms of intermittent dull pain in his left eye, along with the physical examination findings of keratoconus, corneal scarring, and an amelanotic choroidal lesion with associated subretinal fluid, suggest a possible diagnosis of uveal melanoma. The patient's family history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and leukemia also raises the possibility of a hematologic malignancy. Therefore, it is important to further evaluate the patient with imaging studies and laboratory tests to determine the underlying cause of the choroidal lesion.

**Answer**: C: Positron emission tomography scan.

A positron emission tomography (PET) scan would be the next step in the diagnostic workup of this patient. The PET scan would help to identify any potential malignant cells in the choroidal lesion and determine the extent of the disease. Additionally, it would provide valuable information on the metabolic activity of the lesion, which would help guide further management and treatment.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of a rapidly progressing rash and swelling of the left side of the chest wall, along with the physical examination findings of bilateral gynecomastia and inverted left nipple, are concerning for a malignancy. The patient's history of receiving the second dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (Moderna) shortly before the onset of symptoms raises the possibility of a vaccine-related adverse event. However, the patient's age and medical history, including metabolic syndrome and chronic kidney disease, also suggest a possible underlying malignancy. The punch biopsy results showing a diffuse island of atypical cells in the dermis and the immunohistochemical staining results, which were positive for CK-7, GATA-3, and PAX-8, are consistent with a diagnosis of cutaneous angiosarcoma. The positron emission tomography–computed tomography scan findings of a diffuse, infiltrating fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid cutaneous lesion on the left chest wall and multiple FDG-avid nodes in the axilla, left internal mammary, and left cervical chain, also support this diagnosis.

The patient's history of thyroid cancer and chronic left accessory nerve injury increase the likelihood of a paraneoplastic myositis. Additionally, the low-positive Mi2 antibodies and small IgG κ paraprotein found in the patient's serum suggest an autoimmune myopathy. The patient's age and absence of a family history make late-onset Pompe disease less likely. Myasthenia gravis is unlikely given the absence of symptoms such as diplopia, dysarthria, and fatigable weakness.

Sure, I'll do my best to provide a well-structured answer. Here's my reasoning and answer:

**Reasoning**:
The patient's symptoms of loud snoring, infrequent abrupt awakenings with a sensation of breathlessness, and fatigue are consistent with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The patient's history of hypertension and epilepsy also increases the likelihood of OSA. The home sleep test results show a high apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 32.4 events per hour, which supports the diagnosis of OSA.

**Answer**: B: Initiate continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy.

CPAP therapy is the standard treatment for OSA, and it is effective in reducing symptoms and improving quality of life. The patient's high AHI and symptoms indicate a moderate to severe OSA, which would likely respond well to CPAP therapy. Therefore, initiating CPAP therapy would be the next appropriate step in managing this patient's OSA.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of severe physical exhaustion, syncopal episodes, dysphagia, and sinus congestion, along with the findings of diffuse facial edema and erythema without proptosis, suggest a systemic inflammatory response. The presence of mild chemosis and hyperemia in both eyes and a patent Baerveldt tube ostium in the midanterior chamber with normal bleb morphology without a tense capsule, suggest that the inflammation is not related to the tube shunt. The 24-2 Humphrey visual field showed new glaucoma progression in the left eye, indicating that the patient's glaucoma is not well-controlled.

The patient's history of severe primary open-angle glaucoma, elevated IOP in response to topical corticosteroids, and chronic macular edema in both eyes after remote cataract surgery and vitrectomy with membrane peel, suggest that the patient may benefit from additional glaucoma surgery.

**Answer**: D: Place a second nonvalved tube in the left eye with adjuvant micropulse laser.

This answer is chosen because it addresses the patient's uncontrolled glaucoma and the possibility of inflammation, which may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. The addition of a second nonvalved tube in the left eye with adjuvant micropulse laser may help to further reduce IOP and control the patient's glaucoma. Discontinuing fluorometholone eye drops (option A) may not adequately address the patient's glaucoma and inflammation. Performing systemic workup, including chest imaging (option B) may be unnecessary and may not address the patient's glaucoma. Adding netarsudil eye drops every night at bedtime in the left eye (option C) may not be effective in reducing IOP and controlling glaucoma, especially in the presence of a patent Baerveldt tube ostium.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of acute-onset periorbital swelling, binocular diplopia, and right periorbital pain, along with the MRI findings of an intraconal mass, suggest a possible orbital cellulitis or abscess. The patient's history of blunt orbital trauma increases the likelihood of an infectious etiology. Ordering a homovanillic acid and vanillylmandelic acid test can help support the diagnosis of a dermoid/epidermoid cyst, which is less likely given the patient's symptoms and history. Starting high-dose steroids may be considered if the patient's symptoms worsen or if there is evidence of optic nerve damage, but it is not the most appropriate step at this time. Emergency orbital exploration with lesion biopsy may be necessary if the patient's symptoms continue to worsen or if there is evidence of optic nerve damage, but it is not the most appropriate step at this time.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of bilateral blurry vision, large blue paracentral scotomata, and a migraine without a scintillating scotoma, along with the physical examination findings of subtle reddish geographic irregularities at the level of the retinal pigment epithelial at a nasal juxtafoveal location in both eyes, suggest a possible retinal vascular abnormality. The near-infrared imaging findings also support this suspicion. Therefore, the next step would be to perform a diagnostic test that can further evaluate the retinal vasculature and help identify the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

**Answer**: C: Optical coherence tomography (OCT). OCT is a non-invasive imaging test that uses low-coherence interferometry to produce high-resolution cross-sectional images of the retina and choroid. It can help evaluate the retinal thickness, texture, and vasculature, and can diagnose various retinal conditions, including retinal vein occlusion, diabetic retinopathy, and retinal artery occlusion. In this case, OCT can help determine if there is any damage to the retinal vasculature, which may be causing the patient's symptoms.

**Reasoning**: The patient's history of rapidly spreading intensively pruritic papules on her extremities, with no involvement of the palms, soles, or oral mucosa, is consistent with a diagnosis of eruptive pruritic papular porokeratosis (EPP). EPP is a rare, benign, and chronic skin condition characterized by the sudden onset of numerous, small, intensely itchy papules on the extremities. The patient's age and lack of any remarkable medical or family history also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the presence of scattered, erythematous, annular papules measuring up to 5 mm wide, as seen in Figure 1, is consistent with the characteristic histopathologic features of EPP, which include a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate and a granulomatous reaction around the hair follicles.

**Answer**: C: Eruptive pruritic papular porokeratosis.

**Reasoning**: The patient presents with a strong family history of premature ASCVD, with multiple first-degree relatives having coronary artery disease, including a myocardial infarction in his father at age 39 and angioplasty with multiple stents in his older brother at age 43. The patient's 10-year ASCVD risk is low (1.6%) based on the PCEs, but his family history and elevated Lp(a) level (136 nmol/L) indicate a high lifetime risk of ASCVD. The patient's coronary calcium score of 137 Agatston units is also notable and places him in the 94th percentile for his age. Therefore, it is important to address all modifiable cardiovascular risk factors and initiate cascade screening to identify first-degree relatives with elevated Lp(a). Additionally, high-intensity statin therapy and aspirin, 81 mg, daily, may be considered to further reduce the patient's ASCVD risk.

**Answer**: C. Address all modifiable cardiovascular risk factors and initiate cascade screening to identify first-degree relatives with elevated Lp(a).

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of progressive imbalance, intense fear of falling, gaze-evoked horizontal nystagmus, slow saccades, and ataxic dysarthria, along with the absence of stretch reflexes and mute plantar fascia, are consistent with a diagnosis of cerebellar ataxia. The patient's history of hypercholesterolemia and anxiety may also be relevant to the patient's overall health and potential treatment plan, but they are not directly related to the likely diagnosis of cerebellar ataxia.

The patient's age and duration of symptoms, as well as the presence of T2 hyperintensities in bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles, cerebellar white matter, pons, and bilateral thalamus on brain MRI, suggest a slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia.

Of the options provided, the most likely diagnosis is Friedreich ataxia, which is a slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia caused by mutations in the FXN gene. It typically presents with gaze-evoked nystagmus, slow saccades, and ataxic dysarthria, as well as a loss of reflexes and mute plantar fascia, which are all consistent with the patient's symptoms.

The patient's history of a rash on the dorsal aspect of his hand that gradually increased in severity over six months, along with the physical examination findings of large, firm, mildly swollen erythematous plaques with purulent discharge and crusting on the back of the left forearm, are consistent with a diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis. The patient's denial of any systemic symptoms and concerns, and the normal results of routine laboratory investigations, including complete blood cell count, biochemical profile, and chest radiography, also support this diagnosis. The pathological examination findings of hyperkeratosis, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, and lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with neutrophils, plasma cells, and a small amount of multinucleated giant cells in the dermis, as well as the positive staining with periodic acid-Schiff and transmission electron microscopy, further support the diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis.

Sure, I'll do my best to help you with that! Here's my reasoning and answer:

**Reasoning**: The patient presents with intermittent chest pain, which could be indicative of coronary artery disease. The patient's history of smoking and elevated troponin T levels further support this possibility. However, the patient's age and lack of any other significant medical history suggest that other causes of chest pain, such as pulmonary embolism or pneumonia, are less likely. Additionally, the patient's initial electrocardiogram (ECG) shows biphasic T waves in leads V2 and V3, which could indicate myocardial ischemia.

**Answer**: B: Order a dobutamine stress echocardiogram. This test can help confirm or rule out coronary artery disease by assessing the heart's function and blood flow during physical activity. It is a non-invasive test that can provide valuable information to guide further management.

**Reasoning**: The patient has experienced recurrent retrobulbar hemorrhages, which suggests an underlying vascular malformation or an inflammatory condition. The absence of any contributory medical history, recent trauma, or surgery makes it less likely that the hemorrhages are caused by a systemic condition. The persistent, mild, nonreducible, nonpulsatile proptosis unrelated to Valsalva maneuver but associated with extraocular movement limitation in upgaze suggests that there may be a structural lesion in the orbit. The T2-weighted coronal and axial MRI images show an intraorbital lesion, which supports the hypothesis of a structural lesion.

**Reasoning**: Given the patient's history of intermittent bilateral uveitis and scleritis, the current presentation of painful left uveitis and an episcleral nodule, and the presence of elevated intraocular pressure bilaterally, it is likely that the patient has treatment-refractory nodular scleritis. The patient's history of Rosai-Dorfman-Destombes (RDD) disease also suggests an underlying immune-mediated process.

The current treatment of oral prednisone, topical prednisolone acetate, and oral ibuprofen has not provided relief, and the patient's symptoms have persisted for 10 days. Therefore, it is appropriate to consider alternative systemic therapies that can effectively manage the patient's symptoms and address the underlying immune-mediated process.

Intra-arterial melphalan is a treatment option for refractory uveitis, but it may not be the most appropriate choice for this patient given the presence of an episcleral nodule and the patient's history of RDD disease. Subtenon triamcinolone may provide some relief for the patient's symptoms, but it is not a long-term solution and may not address the underlying immune-mediated process.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to initiate an alternative systemic therapy, such as an immunomodulatory agent, to effectively manage the patient's symptoms and address the underlying immune-mediated process.

**Answer**: B: Initiate an alternative systemic therapy (ie, an immunomodulatory agent).

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest the presence of a retinal infection, likely endophthalmitis. The patient has a history of recent cataract surgery and was treated for presumed endophthalmitis with intravitreal injections of antibiotics and a vitreous tap. However, the patient's symptoms and examination findings have not improved as expected, and numerous white retinal lesions are now present. These lesions are concerning for fungal infection, and the patient's history of recent cataract surgery and previous treatment for endophthalmitis increase the likelihood of fungal infection.

**Answer**: B: Pars plana vitrectomy with vitreous biopsy. This is the most appropriate next step in management, as it allows for a definitive diagnosis of fungal infection and provides the opportunity for removal of any infectious material. The patient's history of recent cataract surgery and previous treatment for endophthalmitis increase the likelihood of fungal infection, and the presence of numerous white retinal lesions supports this diagnosis.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of painful and pruritic lower eyelid lesion with a vermiform appearance, followed by conjunctival swelling, and recent exposure to farm animals suggest a possible diagnosis of ocular larva migrans. This is a rare condition caused by the migration of parasitic larvae, usually from the nematode family, into the eye. The presence of whitish linear opacities within the conjunctival lesion supports this diagnosis.

The next step would be to perform a biopsy of the conjunctival lesion to confirm the diagnosis. Cryotherapy and adjuvant therapy with interferon alfa-2b may be effective in treating ocular larva migrans, but a biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis before starting treatment. Surgical removal of the lesion may also be necessary, but a biopsy should be performed first to determine the appropriate course of action. Oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and topical corticosteroids may help alleviate symptoms, but they are not a definitive treatment for ocular larva migrans.

**Reasoning**: The patient presents with a regular supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with a rate of 178 beats/min and a 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) ratio, consistent with a re-entry tachycardia. The presence of right bundle branch block (RBBB) and alternating QRS complexes with a definite allorhythmic distribution suggests a ventricular tachycardia (VT) with aberrant conduction. The patient's history of mitral valve repair increases the likelihood of a cardiac arrhythmia. The absence of any other signs of heart failure or ischemia suggests that the arrhythmia is likely due to a re-entry circuit.

**Answer**: B: Place a temporary pacemaker and start treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin and amiodarone.

A temporary pacemaker should be placed to control the ventricular rate and prevent ventricular fibrillation. Low-molecular-weight heparin should be administered to prevent further embolic events, and amiodarone should be given to convert the arrhythmia and prevent recurrences. DC shock is not necessary in this case, as the arrhythmia is regular and controlled. An urgent electrophysiologic investigation is not necessary at this time, as the clinical presentation and ECG findings are diagnostic of a re-entry tachycardia.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of blurry vision, eye dryness, and lagophthalmos, along with the physical examination findings of upper eyelid retraction and lag on downgaze, suggest a possible diagnosis of an eyelid disorder. The patient's history of a functional pituitary adenoma, breast cancer, and tamoxifen therapy may also be relevant to the patient's overall health and potential treatment plan, but they do not directly explain the eyelid symptoms.

**Answer**: A: Serum thyroid laboratory testing.

The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a possible thyroid-related eyelid disorder, such as Graves' ophthalmopathy or thyroid-associated orbitopathy. Serum thyroid laboratory testing can help determine if there is an underlying thyroid disorder that may be contributing to the patient's eyelid symptoms. Additionally, measuring the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level can help assess the patient's thyroid function and rule out other potential causes of eyelid retraction, such as hyperthyroidism.

Therefore, the next step in the patient's evaluation would be to order serum thyroid laboratory tests, including TSH, free thyroxine (FT4), and free triiodothyronine (FT3), to help determine the underlying cause of the patient's eyelid symptoms.

**Reasoning**: The patient's history of cutaneous melanoma and the presence of a pigmented corneal mass suggest a possible diagnosis of melanocytic lesion. The absence of any other symptoms or signs of intraocular melanoma, such as ectropion uvea, corectopia, or feeder vessels, and the lack of any metabolically active disease on positron emission tomography/computed tomography scans, make it less likely that the lesion is a melanoma. However, the presence of a well-demarcated pigmented brown lesion without extension into the angle, as seen on four-mirror gonioscopy, raises the possibility of a benign melanocytic nevus. To further evaluate the lesion and establish a definitive diagnosis, a corneal biopsy would be the next step.

**Reasoning**: The patient has a persistent cheek and orbit lesion, dense amblyopia, large-angle monocular esotropia and hypertropia, and proptosis of the left eye despite previous treatments. The repeated magnetic resonance image shows persistent orbital involvement causing medial displacement of the lateral rectus muscle and mass effect on the globe. Given the patient's young age and the risk of amblyopia, it is important to consider treatments that can effectively reduce the size of the lesion and improve vision.

**Answer**: B: Interventional radiology embolization and debulking. This treatment has been shown to be effective in reducing the size of hemangiomas and improving vision in similar cases. It is minimally invasive and can be performed under local anesthesia, which is ideal for young children. Additionally, it allows for precise targeting of the lesion and can be repeated as needed.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms, including asymptomatic erythematous-infiltrated patches and plaques on the scalp and face, gradually enlarging and coalescing into large plaques and nodules, with occasional mild erosions on the surface of the lesions, are consistent with intravascular anaplastic large cell lymphoma. The biopsy results, which showed sheets of medium to large mononuclear cells infiltrated in the dermis, some of which filled and expanded apparent dermal blood vessels and had large, irregular, pleomorphic nuclei, also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the fact that the tumor cells were positive for CD3 and negative for CD20, AE1/AE3, CK20, chromogranin A, and melan-A, and had a high Ki-67 labeling index of 70%, further suggests an aggressive lymphoma such as intravascular anaplastic large cell lymphoma.

**Reasoning**: The patient has bilateral refractory neurosensory retinal and pigment epithelial detachments, with persistent subretinal fluid and enlarging pigment epithelial detachments despite 32 monthly injections of anti-VEGF. The presence of yellow subretinal deposits in the right eye suggests central serous chorioretinopathy. The patient's visual acuity is 20/40 OD and 20/25 OS, and the OCT scans show thinning of the choroid.

Considering the patient's history and clinical presentation, the most appropriate next step would be to start photodynamic therapy. Photodynamic therapy is a treatment that uses a light-sensitive medication and low-intensity laser light to damage and shrink the abnormal blood vessels in the retina, which can help reduce the amount of subretinal fluid and improve vision.

**Reasoning**:
The patient presented with a left upper neck mass that was first noted at birth, with no fevers, constitutional symptoms, or enlargement of the mass. On physical examination, there was a nontender 4-cm mass in the left submandibular region with no overlying skin changes. Ultrasonography results showed an avascular cystic structure with internal debris and a single thin septation. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the neck soft tissue revealed a 3-cm low attenuation, nonenhancing, cystic-appearing mass that elevated the submandibular gland to the level of the parapharyngeal fat space with medial extension of the lesion into the tongue musculature. The walls were thin except for mildly thickened capsule along the posterior aspect of the lesion. Fluid that aspirated from the cyst was serous, and cytology showed mature and anucleate squamous cells with acute inflammation. The mass returned after 3 weeks. Further analysis 8 months after the initial CT via contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a large, multiseptated cystic structure. The capsule of the wall was mildly thickened and was contrast enhancing. At age 12 months, the mass was excised via neck dissection. A lateral component at the level of the sternocleidomastoid muscle was completely excised. An intraoperative rupture of the thin capsule caused some spillage of cystic contents that were milky white in some areas and mucinous in others.
Based on the patient's symptoms and the results of the imaging studies, the most likely diagnosis is a branchial cleft cyst.

Sure, I'll do my best to help you with that! Here's my reasoning and answer:

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of bilateral retro-orbital pain, blurred vision, and wavy lines in her vision, along with the physical examination findings of bilateral grade 1 optic disc edema, suggest a possible diagnosis of papilledema. The absence of any intracranial pressure (ICP) elevation on lumbar puncture and the patient's normal neurological examination except for moderate weakness of dorsiflexors at the ankles bilaterally as well as toe extensors and everters, suggest that the papilledema is unlikely to be caused by a space-occupying lesion or hydrocephalus. The patient's history of mild obesity and thrombocytosis suggest a possible diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). IIH is a condition characterized by elevated ICP without an identifiable cause, and it is often associated with obesity and platelet dysfunction.

**Answer**: B: Serum vascular endothelial growth factor.

The next step in the management of this patient would be to check for the presence of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in her serum, as elevated levels of VEGF have been associated with IIH. If the VEGF level is elevated, it would support the diagnosis of IIH and guide further management.

Please let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like me to elaborate on my reasoning.

The patient's symptoms of fever, night sweats, fatigue, weight loss, and abdominal pain, along with the physical examination findings of bilateral cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymphadenopathy, and the laboratory results of elevated levels of IL-10, IL-6, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, are consistent with a diagnosis of multicentric Castleman disease. The patient's age and medical history also support this diagnosis, as Castleman disease is more common in older adults and can occur in association with other medical conditions, such as mitral valve repair. The patient's negative HIV, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C assays also support this diagnosis, as Castleman disease is not associated with these infections. The computed tomography scan and positron emission tomography–computed tomography findings of extensive cervical, supraclavicular, retroperitoneal, pelvic, and inguinal lymphadenopathy, with extensive inflammation and fat stranding adjacent to these enlarged nodes, are also consistent with multicentric Castleman disease.

**Reasoning**:
The patient presented with an asymptomatic, slowly growing, reddish verrucous plaque on the right temple, with surface hemorrhagic crust and no associated symptoms. The lesion was non-tender, with no purulent discharge or severe necrotic changes. The patient had no history of fever, weight loss, or night sweats. The laboratory tests, including blood cell counts, urinalysis, and kidney and hepatic panels, revealed no abnormalities. The histopathological examination showed papillomatous epidermal hyperplasia, edema of dermal papillae, and neoplastic infiltration consisting of small round blue cells with alternating areas of dense and loose cellularity. The tumor cells were positive for MyoD1.

**Answer**: B: Primary superficial Ewing sarcoma.

Ewing sarcoma is a rare type of cancer that occurs in the bones or soft tissues, and it typically affects children and young adults. The primary superficial Ewing sarcoma is a rare variant of Ewing sarcoma, accounting for only 6% of all Ewing sarcoma cases. It usually presents as a slowly growing, painless mass in the soft tissues, and it has a better prognosis than the conventional Ewing sarcoma. The patient's symptoms and the histopathological findings are consistent with primary superficial Ewing sarcoma. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate answer.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of bilateral complete ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, and decreased sensation to light touch and pinprick in the V1/V2 distribution of the trigeminal nerve bilaterally, along with the physical examination findings of normal intraocular pressure and no exophthalmos, suggest a diagnosis of bilateral complete ophthalmoplegia. The patient's history of a recent robotic cystectomy and the presence of a large sellar mass on MRI, which no longer had central enhancement, suggest that the ophthalmoplegia is likely due to a pituitary tumor. The absence of any other signs of orbital compartment syndrome, such as proptosis or ophthalmoplegia, and the lack of any history of trauma or recent surgery, make orbital compartment syndrome less likely. Ocular motor apraxia is also less likely given the patient's normal visual acuity and full visual fields on confrontational visual field testing. Pituitary apoplexy is a possibility, but the absence of any other symptoms such as headache, vomiting, or altered mental status, and the lack of any evidence of hemorrhage on MRI, make it less likely.

**Reasoning**: The patient's presentation of jaundice and malaise, along with a history of intravenous heroin use and chronic inactive HBV infection, suggests a possible diagnosis of acute liver injury. The patient's last intravenous heroin use occurred 9 days prior to presentation, which may be a contributing factor to the liver injury. The patient's normal liver enzyme values and lack of evidence of cirrhosis suggest that the liver injury is likely due to a viral hepatitis infection rather than alcohol-related liver disease. The patient's history of chronic HBV infection increases the likelihood of HDV superinfection.

Ordering testing for hepatitis E virus IgM antibody may help identify another cause of acute liver injury, such as hepatitis E virus infection. However, the patient's history of intravenous heroin use and chronic HBV infection make it less likely that hepatitis E virus infection is the cause of the liver injury.

Ordering testing for HDV IgM and IgG antibodies and, if positive, testing for HDV RNA is a higher priority because HDV superinfection is a more likely cause of acute liver injury in this patient population. If HDV superinfection is confirmed, it may guide treatment decisions and influence the patient's prognosis.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Answer**: D: Order testing for hepatitis delta virus (HDV) IgM and IgG antibodies and, if positive, test for HDV RNA.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of recurrent eye and ear pain, along with the physical examination findings of scleral erythema and auricular swelling, suggest a possible diagnosis of ocular and auricular inflammation. The patient's history of similar episodes in the past, along with the negative results for antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies and HLA-B27, make it less likely that the condition is caused by Wegener granulomatosis or polyarteritis nodosa. The patient's weight loss and cough suggest that there may be a systemic component to the disease. The elevated ESR and CRP support the idea of an inflammatory process.

**Answer**: C: Prescribe prednisone, 0.25 to 1 mg/kg orally daily. Prednisone is a corticosteroid that is commonly used to treat inflammatory conditions such as this. The dosage of 0.25 to 1 mg/kg orally daily is a typical starting dose for adult patients with inflammatory conditions.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with myasthenia gravis (MG), an autoimmune disorder that affects the nervous system and causes muscle weakness. The left upper eyelid ptosis and the decreased margin-to-reflex distance 1 on the left side are indicative of MG. The absence of other neurological deficits, such as diplopia, dysarthria, or dysphagia, is consistent with a mild form of MG. The patient's history of hyperlipidemia and hypothyroidism may also be relevant to the patient's overall health and potential treatment plan, but they are not directly related to the patient's current symptoms.

Single-fiber electromyography (SFEMG) is a diagnostic test that can confirm the diagnosis of MG by measuring the abnormal electrical activity of the muscles. It is the most sensitive and specific test for MG, and it can help differentiate MG from other conditions that may cause similar symptoms. In this case, SFEMG should be performed to confirm the diagnosis of MG and guide further management.

**Reasoning**: The patient presents with a subluxated PCIOL in the right eye, which is likely causing the vision loss. The superonasal pigmented scleral lesion may be related to the subluxation or may be an incidental finding. To determine the cause of the vision loss and the appropriate course of treatment, it is important to perform a biopsy of the ocular surface lesion. This will help to determine if the lesion is related to the subluxation or if it is a separate entity that needs to be addressed.

**Answer**: D: Perform a biopsy of the ocular surface lesion.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of bilateral corneal ulcers, dry and leathery conjunctiva, and eyelash hypertrichosis suggest a diagnosis of ocular surface disease. The patient's history of severe autism spectrum disorder and restrictive and repetitive behaviors may indicate a higher risk of developing ocular surface disease due to difficulty with proper eye care and hygiene. The patient's diet, consisting exclusively of cookies, apples, potato chips, and Gatorade, may also contribute to the development of ocular surface disease.

The presence of a 3-mm paracentral epithelial defect with 60% stromal thinning and a 1-mm infiltrate in the right cornea, as well as a small crescentic fibrin deposit nasally in the right anterior chamber, suggest a more severe condition that requires prompt intervention.

Given the severity of the disease and the risk of vision loss, the best course of action would be to perform therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty of the right eye. This procedure would involve replacing the damaged corneal tissue with healthy donor tissue, which would help to restore vision and prevent further complications.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of sudden onset vertigo, right aural fullness, and subjective right-sided hearing loss, along with a positive Dix-Hallpike test and worsening symptoms over time, suggest a peripheral vestibular disorder. The audiogram results show a right-sided low- to mid-frequency moderate conductive hearing loss and bilateral high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss, which is consistent with a middle ear or inner ear disorder. The patient's history of no prior otologic surgery, head trauma, or recent upper respiratory infection reduces the likelihood of other causes of vertigo such as Meniere disease or superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome. A CT scan of the temporal bone would help to further evaluate the inner ear and rule out other causes of vertigo.

**Reasoning**: The patient presented with a 4-month history of a slowly progressive painless lateral neck mass on the right side, which suggests a benign etiology. The mass moved with swallowing, indicating that it was likely a thyroid or parathyroid lesion. The patient had normal thyroid stimulating hormone and calcium levels, which ruled out hyperthyroidism and hypoparathyroidism. The neck ultrasonography and CT scan revealed a well-circumscribed anechoic lesion in the right thyroid lobe, which was consistent with a thyroid or parathyroid cyst. The NIRAF camera yielded a homogenously dim lesion, which suggested a benign lesion. The pathologic examination confirmed a normal right thyroid lobe, a normal right parathyroid gland, and a cystic lesion at the inferior pole with no evidence of malignant disease in the specimen. The tissue inside the lesion stained positive for PTH, which supported the diagnosis of a parathyroid cyst.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of preauricular and right upper neck swelling, along with the physical examination findings of no erythema or tenderness of the parotid, suggest a possible diagnosis of a parotid gland tumor. The patient's history of coronary artery disease and prior myocardial infarction may also indicate a potential risk of bleeding complications. The urinalysis results showing slight hematuria and the patient's international normalized ratio (INR) of 4.4 suggest that the patient may be taking anticoagulant medication, which could contribute to bleeding complications. The contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan revealing an ill-defined infiltrative mass centered in the deep lobe of the right parotid gland with extension into surrounding soft tissue spaces supports the diagnosis of a parotid gland tumor. The follow-up CT scan performed 6 weeks later shows progression of the tumor.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of fatigue, night sweats, and weight loss, along with the physical examination findings of tender, nonfluctuant plaques on the scalp and dorsal hands, are concerning for a possible diagnosis of necrotizing vasculitis. The patient's history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia increases the likelihood of this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's low hemoglobin level, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and elevated C-reactive protein level support this diagnosis. The presence of acute deep vein thrombosis (DVT) also suggests a possible underlying inflammatory condition.

**Answer**: B: Perform a bone marrow biopsy with flow cytometry and cytogenetics. This is the most appropriate next step in the patient's diagnostic workup, as it can help to confirm the diagnosis of necrotizing vasculitis and identify any underlying hematological disorders. The bone marrow biopsy will also allow for further evaluation of the patient's marrow elements, including the presence of any abnormal cells or infiltrates.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of pruritic wheals on her face and bilateral, transient eyelid swelling, which spread over her neck, chest, trunk, and arms, and resolved within 24 hours, are consistent with urticaria. The patient's history of no recent infections, atopy, urticaria, angioedema, or food or drug allergy, and no recent use of over-the-counter medications, suggests that the COVID-19 mRNA booster vaccine is the likely cause of her urticaria. The patient's normal vital signs, absence of tongue, lip, or throat swelling, and clear lungs, suggest that she does not have anaphylaxis. The patient's positive response to pressure testing with a pen cap and tongue depressor, indicates that she has a type of physical urticaria, likely cholinergic urticaria.

**Answer**: C: Prescribe a nonsedating antihistamine at a standard dose and increase to high-dose antihistamine if symptoms persist.

It is important to note that the patient should be referred for allergy testing to confirm the diagnosis and to determine the appropriate course of action for future vaccinations. Additionally, the patient should be advised to avoid future COVID-19 mRNA vaccination until further evaluation and guidance from an allergist.

**Reasoning**:
The patient's symptoms of intermittent pain in the operative site, associated with a small lump over the left neck, and the pain being worse on touch and head turning, suggest a possible inflammatory or infectious process. The fact that the patient has a history of previous left superficial parotidectomy 10 years before for a Warthin tumor, and the presence of a focus of nodular oncocytic hyperplasia in the adjacent parenchyma and reactive intraparotid lymph nodes in the histology results, increase the likelihood of a benign rather than malignant process. The absence of any focal lesion in either parotid glands or at the area of interest over the left sternocleidomastoid muscle on the MRI scan, supports the hypothesis of a benign process. The patient's age and the presence of a small lump also suggest a possibility of a benign tumor.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of fluctuating diplopia and worsening right upper eyelid ptosis, along with the small exotropia and supraduction deficit, suggest a possible diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. The application of an ice pack to the ptotic eyelid, which led to a 1.5-mm improvement in ptosis and no appreciable change in strabismus, supports this diagnosis. Myasthenia gravis is a chronic autoimmune disorder that affects the nervous system and can cause weakness in the extraocular muscles, leading to ptosis and strabismus. The patient's history of hypertension may also be relevant, as hypertension can be a comorbidity in patients with myasthenia gravis.

**Answer**: B: Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbit.

The next step in the patient's evaluation would be to order magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbit to look for any abnormalities in the brain and orbit that may be related to the patient's symptoms. MRI is a non-invasive imaging technique that can provide detailed information about the structure and function of the brain and orbit. In patients with myasthenia gravis, MRI may show abnormalities in the thymus, such as a thymoma or thymic hyperplasia, which are common findings in patients with this condition. Additionally, MRI can help to rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a brain tumor or stroke.

Therefore, the answer is B: Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbit.

**Reasoning**:
The patient's symptoms of blurry vision, ocular pain, and subconjunctival yellow discoloration in the left eye, along with the physical findings of diffuse conjunctival chemosis, low-grade aqueous reaction, and pseudophakia, suggest a possible diagnosis of choroidal melanoma. The presence of a solid lesion on B-scan ultrasonography and the association with choroidal hemorrhage further support this diagnosis. However, the patient's history of bilateral cataract surgery and the absence of any other symptoms or signs in the right eye suggest that the lesion may not be a metastasis from a primary melanoma in the right eye. Therefore, it is important to rule out an occult systemic neoplasm before proceeding with treatment.

Sure, I can help you with that. Here's my reasoning and answer:

**Reasoning**: The patient's fever, hypotension, and worsening necrotic wound suggest that she is experiencing septic shock due to a severe infection. The negative wound cultures and blood cultures suggest that the infection is not caused by a bacterial, mycobacterial, or fungal organism. The patient's recent history of methergine injection and the development of a painful swelling at the injection site suggest that the infection may be caused by a reaction to the methergine. The patient's elevated white blood cell count, lactate level, and procalcitonin level support the diagnosis of sepsis. The histopathologic examination of the excised tissue showing dense dermal neutrophilic infiltration suggests that the infection is caused by a non-bacterial, non-fungal agent.

**Answer**: C: Start hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is indicated for the treatment of necrotizing soft tissue infections, which is consistent with the patient's worsening necrotic wound. It is also possible that the methergine injection may have caused a localized tissue reaction, which could be treated with hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Additionally, hyperbaric oxygen therapy may help to reduce the risk of further tissue damage and promote wound healing.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of joint pain, nasal deformity, and abnormal urinalysis suggest a possible diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE is an autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organ systems, including the joints, skin, and kidneys. The patient's history of osteoarthritis and obstructive sleep apnea may also be relevant to the patient's overall health and potential treatment plan, but they are not directly related to the patient's current symptoms.

The urinalysis findings of red blood cell casts and proteinuria suggest kidney involvement, which is consistent with SLE. The patient's elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels also support the diagnosis of SLE.

Therefore, the next step would be to confirm the diagnosis of SLE by checking for the presence of antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, which are commonly elevated in SLE patients. Additionally, a kidney biopsy may be necessary to evaluate the extent of kidney damage and to rule out other potential causes of nephritis.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of bilateral periorbital pain and swelling, diplopia, and pain with extraocular movement, along with the findings of bilateral lateral rectus muscle enlargement and mild enlargement of the left medial rectus muscle on orbital computed tomography, suggest orbital inflammation. The absence of constitutional, dermatologic, or neurologic symptoms and the recent change in medication for Crohn disease suggest that the orbital inflammation is likely related to the patient's Crohn disease. The patient's history of Crohn disease and the presence of a chronic inflammatory process with infiltrates composed of a mixture of epithelioid histiocytes and small-sized lymphocytes associated with severe muscle atrophy on lateral rectus biopsy support this diagnosis.

**Answer**: B: Change therapies for Crohn disease.

The patient's symptoms and findings suggest that the orbital inflammation is related to his Crohn disease. The patient's medication for Crohn disease was recently changed from infliximab to ustekinumab, which may not be effective in controlling the inflammation. Therefore, changing the therapy for Crohn disease to a different medication may be effective in resolving the orbital inflammation and preventing further recurrences.

Sure, I'll do my best to help you with that! Here's my reasoning and answer:

**Reasoning**:
The patient's history of abnormal retinal findings and mildly decreased visual acuity, along with the physical examination findings of multiple vitelliform lesions involving the macula and superior macula bilaterally, suggest a possible diagnosis of acute exudative polymorphous vitelliform maculopathy (AEPVM). However, the absence of a choroidal neovascular membrane and the presence of hyperreflectance corresponding to the yellow pigment in the vitelliform lesions in the subretinal space on OCT suggest that the idiopathic or paraneoplastic variant of AEPVM is more likely. The patient's lack of a significant medical history and family history of retinal diseases also support this diagnosis.

To confirm the diagnosis and rule out any potential underlying malignancy, I would recommend the following steps:

1. Computed tomographic scan of chest, abdomen, and pelvis: This imaging modality can help identify any potential systemic malignancies that may be associated with the paraneoplastic variant of AEPVM.
2. Repeat anti-VEGF treatment: If the patient's visual acuity has not improved with previous anti-VEGF treatment, repeat treatment may be necessary to help improve vision and reduce the risk of further vision loss.
3. Genetic testing: Genetic testing may be useful in identifying genetic mutations associated with the idiopathic or paraneoplastic variant of AEPVM, which can help guide further management and counseling.
4. Antiretinal antibody testing: This test can help rule out the presence of antiretinal antibodies, which are commonly seen in paraneoplastic retinal degenerations.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of flickering photopsias and a temporal scotoma progressing to a “brown tint” of her vision in her left eye, along with the physical examination findings of shallow subretinal fluid and choroidal detachments without retinal breaks, inflammation, or optic nerve edema, are consistent with worsening angle closure after successful laser peripheral iridotomy. The patient's history of narrow angles in both eyes and the failure of systemic corticosteroids to resolve the subretinal fluid also support this diagnosis.

**Answer**: D: Perform a clear lens exchange in the left eye.

A clear lens exchange is the best option for this patient as it will effectively treat the worsening angle closure by removing the lens that is contributing to the narrow angles and increasing the risk of further angle closure. Repeat LPI (option A) may not be effective in treating the worsening angle closure and may even worsen the condition. Performing an LPI in the right eye (option B) is not necessary at this time as the patient's symptoms are only affecting the left eye. Sclerectomy (option C) may be considered in cases where the angle closure is caused by a plugged drainage channel, but it is not the best option for this patient as the angle closure is caused by the lens.

**Reasoning**: Based on the patient's history of rosacea and the clinical appearance of the lesions, the most likely diagnosis is lichen spinulosus. Lichen spinulosus is a rare, benign condition characterized by the development of multiple, small, skin-colored to yellowish keratotic spiny projections on the skin, often associated with rosacea. The condition typically affects the face, neck, and upper limbs, but can also occur on other parts of the body. The lesions are usually asymptomatic and may be present for many years. The patient's history of rosacea and the distribution of the lesions on the left side of the body, sparing the face, palms, soles, and entire right side, are consistent with lichen spinulosus. The histopathological findings of orthokeratosis with parakeratotic columns emerging from an epidermal invagination, mild acanthosis, and a normal granular layer also support this diagnosis.

**Reasoning**: The patient's recent development of hematuria and laboratory parameters suggestive of hemolysis, along with chest radiography showing pulmonary edema and low-flow alarms sounding on the device console, indicate that the patient is experiencing complications related to the pVAD support. Specifically, the severe mitral regurgitation (MR) revealed by the transesophageal echocardiogram suggests that the pVAD may not be effectively unloading the left ventricle, leading to increased left atrial pressure and pulmonary edema. Moreover, the hemolysis may be caused by the pVAD's shear stress on the blood elements.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to consult cardiovascular surgery to discuss mitral valve surgery, as the patient's severe MR may require surgical intervention to address the underlying valve dysfunction. This would be the most efficient way to address the root cause of the patient's complications and optimize their chances of recovery.

**Answer**: B: Consult cardiovascular surgery to discuss mitral valve surgery.

Sure, I'll do my best to provide a well-structured answer. Here's my reasoning and answer:

**Reasoning**:
The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest the presence of macular fluid in the right eye, which may be related to the patient's history of normal-tension glaucoma. The patient's history of latanoprost use for the past five years and lack of reproducible visual field defects suggest that the fluid may be related to another cause. The patient's cup-disc ratio is also abnormal, which may indicate a possible glaucomatous optic neuropathy.

**Answer**: C: OCT of the optic nerve head.

I choose this answer because the patient's history of normal-tension glaucoma and the abnormal cup-disc ratio suggest that there may be a glaucomatous optic neuropathy. The OCT of the optic nerve head will help to evaluate the structure of the optic nerve and confirm the diagnosis of glaucoma. Additionally, it will help to identify any potential retinal nerve fiber layer defects that may be related to the patient's symptoms.

Sure, I'll do my best to help you with that! Here's my reasoning and answer:

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of painless vision loss, photophobia, and disc edema with flame hemorrhages suggest a possible diagnosis of bilateral hemorrhagic optic disc edema. The patient's history of intravenous drug abuse and multiple sexual partners increases the likelihood of a diagnosis related to infectious or inflammatory causes. The patient's hypertension and diabetes may also contribute to the development of this condition.

**Answer**: B: Administer 1000 mg of intravenous methylprednisolone. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a possible inflammatory or infectious cause of the bilateral hemorrhagic optic disc edema. Intravenous methylprednisolone can help reduce inflammation and swelling in the optic nerve and retina, potentially improving vision. It is important to note that this answer is based on the information provided and may not be the only appropriate course of action.

**Reasoning**: Given the patient's history of advanced primary open-angle glaucoma and recent surgical interventions, the current symptoms of eye pain, decreased vision, and scleral thickening suggest a possible diagnosis of autoimmune scleritis. The negative lab workup for autoimmune scleritis does not rule out the diagnosis, as some cases may have negative serology. The patient's worsening eye pain and development of a dense cataract with retrolenticular plaque suggest a possible infectious etiology, such as endophthalmitis. The lack of growth on vitreous samples may indicate the presence of a fastidious organism or a sterile inflammation.

**Reasoning**: The patient presents with bilateral upper eyelid ecchymosis and edema, as well as a mass on the right temporal area. The patient has a history of hitting the right side of his head on a table, which could have caused the ecchymosis and edema. The mass on the right temporal area could be a result of a hematoma or swelling from the trauma. The patient's young age and lack of other symptoms suggest that the cause is likely traumatic rather than infectious or inflammatory. The presence of subconjunctival hemorrhage temporally on the right eye also supports this diagnosis.

**Answer**: B: Reassurance and treatment with cool compresses and artificial tears. The patient's condition is likely a result of trauma and not a serious medical condition. The patient should be reassured and treated with cool compresses and artificial tears to help reduce swelling and promote healing. Brain/orbital imaging may be necessary if the patient's condition worsens or if there are concerns of a more serious injury. Contacting Child Protective Services may be necessary if there are concerns of child abuse. A serologic workup for bleeding diathesis may be necessary if the patient has a family history of bleeding disorders or if there are other signs of bleeding.

Sure, I can help you with that! Here's my reasoning and answer:

**Reasoning**:
The patient's isolated reduced diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (Dlco) cannot be explained by the hemoglobin level alone, as the patient's hemoglobin level is within the normal range. The Dlco is a measure of the ability of the lungs to transfer gas from the alveoli to the blood, and a reduced Dlco can indicate an abnormality in the alveolar-capillary membrane or the small airways. The patient's normal forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume suggest that the problem is not with the large airways, but rather with the small airways or the alveolar-capillary membrane.

**Answer**: C: The isolated reduced Dlco likely reflects an alveolar-capillary gas transfer abnormality.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of polyarthralgia and swelling of bilateral fingers and toes, along with the elevated alkaline phosphatase level, suggest a possible diagnosis of calciphylaxis. Calciphylaxis is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of kidney transplantation, characterized by deposition of calcium in the soft tissues. The patient's history of tertiary hyperparathyroidism and invasive fungal infection of the central nervous system increases the likelihood of this diagnosis.

It is important to note that the patient's medications, including tacrolimus and voriconazole, may also contribute to the development of calciphylaxis. Therefore, it is crucial to evaluate the patient's medication regimen and consider potential drug interactions.

**Answer**: B: Perform a bone biopsy. A bone biopsy would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of calciphylaxis and assess the extent of bone involvement. The biopsy would also help to rule out other potential causes of polyarthralgia and swelling, such as infection or neoplasm.

**Reasoning**: The patient presents with a mass on the lateral canthus of her right eye, which has gradually grown over 2 months and is tender to palpation. The patient denies any vision changes, facial trauma, redness, or discharge from the lesion. The examination reveals a 3-mm subcutaneous, firm, mobile, noncompressible lesion near the lateral canthus of the right eye without overlying erythema, warmth, telangiectasia, or ulceration. The rest of the ophthalmic and orbital examination is normal.

Given the patient's symptoms and examination findings, it is important to consider the possibility of a benign or malignant tumor. The patient's age and the location of the lesion near the lateral canthus of the eye increase the likelihood of a benign tumor, such as a dermoid cyst or a benign orbital tumor. However, it is important to rule out the possibility of a malignant tumor, such as a basal cell carcinoma or a squamous cell carcinoma, which can also occur in this location.

Conservative management with warm compresses and eyelid massage may be appropriate for a benign tumor, but it is not sufficient to rule out malignancy. Excisional biopsy of the lesion is the most appropriate next step to determine the diagnosis and guide further management.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of acute-onset weakness of his bilateral lower limbs, ascending numbness, and sensory level at T6, along with the MRI findings of an area of T2 hyperintensity in the left posterolateral cord at T7, are consistent with a diagnosis of acute myelopathy. The patient's history of an asymptomatic papular skin eruption, with a recent increase in the number of lesions, and the absence of other systemic symptoms, suggests a diagnosis of malignant atrophic papulosis (MAP). MAP is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome associated with certain types of cancer, such as lung, breast, and lymphoma. The patient's negative workup for malignancy, including a full-body CT scan and paraneoplastic antibody panel, makes a diagnosis of MAP less likely. However, the presence of skin papules and the patient's symptoms of acute myelopathy, which can be a presenting symptom of MAP, support this diagnosis.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of pharyngitis and tonsillar exudates, along with the negative rapid strep test and throat culture results, suggest a possible diagnosis of viral pharyngitis. The patient's age and lack of sexual history make it less likely that the cause is a sexually transmitted infection. The presence of bilateral white tonsillar exudates and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy support the diagnosis of pharyngitis. The patient's lack of improvement after taking antibiotics for 7 days also suggests that the infection is likely viral in nature.

**Answer**: B: Prescribe azithromycin. Azithromycin is a macrolide antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of bacterial and viral pathogens, including those that cause pharyngitis. It is a reasonable choice for treating viral pharyngitis, as it may help to reduce the severity and duration of symptoms. However, it is important to note that antibiotics are not effective against viral infections, and the patient's symptoms may not improve with treatment. Further follow-up and testing may be necessary to determine the cause of the patient's symptoms and to rule out other possible diagnoses.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms and findings, such as ocular and periocular pain, photophobia, conjunctival hyperemia, ciliary congestion, anterior chamber flare, keratic precipitates, and swelling of the optic disc, are consistent with anterior uveitis. The patient's history of atopic dermatitis increases the likelihood of an autoimmune etiology. The presence of vitritis and swelling of the optic disc in both eyes suggests a possible inflammatory or infectious cause. The negative anti–Treponema pallidum antibodies test reduces the likelihood of syphilis-related uveitis. The patient's age and the absence of other systemic symptoms suggest that the condition is unlikely to be related to a systemic infection or a malignancy.

**Answer**: C: Order magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits.

The patient's symptoms and findings suggest an inflammatory or infectious cause, and the presence of swelling of the optic disc in both eyes raises the possibility of a central nervous system (CNS) involvement. MRI of the brain and orbits would help to rule out any intracranial inflammatory or infectious disease, such as multiple sclerosis, and would provide further information on the extent of the inflammation in the optic nerves. Topical corticosteroids and cycloplegics may provide some symptomatic relief, but they would not address the underlying cause of the uveitis. Urinalysis and urinary β2-microglobulin test may be useful in the evaluation of some systemic diseases, but they are not directly related to the patient's symptoms and findings. Observation alone would not provide any further information and would not be an appropriate management strategy for this patient.

The absence of anhidrosis and the presence of a small pupillary defect suggest a possible diagnosis of a cranial nerve palsy. The patient's history of trigeminal neuralgia and recent normal CT scan of the brain make it less likely that the symptoms are due to a stroke or tumor. Therefore, the next step would be to perform a lumbar puncture to analyze the cellular composition of the cerebrospinal fluid to help confirm the diagnosis of cranial nerve palsy.
**Answer**: B: Perform lumbar puncture to analyze cellular composition of cerebrospinal fluid.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of bilateral eye redness and pain, along with the physical examination findings of diffuse scleral injection that does not blanch after administration of phenylephrine, suggest a diagnosis of scleritis. Scleritis is a serious inflammatory condition that can cause vision loss if left untreated. The patient's history of dry eye disease and use of preservative-free artificial tears suggest that the scleritis may be caused by an autoimmune response. The patient's history of unprotected sexual contact with multiple male partners also raises the possibility of an infectious cause, such as syphilis or herpes simplex virus.

**Answer**: C: Laboratory work-up for infectious and autoimmune disease.

It is important to note that the patient's history of HIV and highly active antiretroviral therapy may also play a role in the patient's overall health and potential treatment plan, but it is not directly related to the likely diagnosis of scleritis.

Sure, I'll do my best to provide a well-structured answer. Here's my reasoning and answer:

**Reasoning**:
The patient presents with sudden enlargement of a cystic iris stromal lesion, which is causing cloudy vision and discomfort in the left eye. The lesion is large and has increased in size since the patient's last examination four years ago. The patient has a history of primary open-angle glaucoma and pseudophakia in both eyes, which increases the risk of complications. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest that the lesion may be causing increased intraocular pressure and potentially obstructing the visual axis.

**Answer**: C: Biopsy.

I would recommend a biopsy to determine the nature of the cystic lesion and guide further management. The patient's history of glaucoma and pseudophakia increases the risk of complications, and a biopsy will help to determine whether the lesion is benign or malignant. If the lesion is malignant, prompt treatment will be necessary to prevent further spread and potential loss of vision. If the lesion is benign, close observation may be appropriate, but the patient should be monitored closely for any changes in the lesion or symptoms.

**Reasoning**: The patient has a history of glaucoma and pseudoexfoliation syndrome, which increases the risk of bleb-related complications. The patient also has a history of pulmonary Mycobacterium avium infection, which may affect the immune system and increase the risk of endophthalmitis. The patient's symptoms of acute vision loss and conjunctival hyperemia, along with the presence of a hypopyon, are consistent with endophthalmitis. The presence of a small hypopyon in the left eye suggests that the infection may have spread bilaterally.

**Answer**: C: Review and adjust systemic medications and treat with topical corticosteroids.

It is important to review the patient's systemic medications, including the antibiotics she is taking for the pulmonary infection, to ensure that they are appropriate and effective in treating the endophthalmitis. Topical corticosteroids should also be prescribed to reduce inflammation and prevent further damage to the eye. Pars plana vitrectomy with intravitreal antibiotics may be necessary if the infection does not respond to medical treatment or if there is evidence of retinal detachment or other severe complications. Treatment with oral antibiotics alone (option B) may not be sufficient to treat the endophthalmitis, and treatment with systemic and topical corticosteroids alone (option D) may not be effective in eliminating the infection.

The patient presented with violaceous plaques on the left lower extremity, which had been present for years but have been enlarging and darkening over the past 5 years. The patient is a young man, which makes Kaposi sarcoma less likely as it is more common in older men. The patient also does not have a history of HIV or AIDS, which is a common association with Kaposi sarcoma. The patient does not have any symptoms such as pruritus, bleeding, or pain, which is consistent with Stewart-Bluefarb syndrome. Acroangiodermatitis of Mali is a rare condition that is usually seen in children and young adults in West Africa, and it is not associated with violaceous plaques. Lichen planus is a common skin condition, but it does not present with violaceous plaques.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of episodic breathlessness, cough, and wheezing with expectoration of brownish sputum, along with the physical examination findings of a depressed plaque and multiple nodules on the right cheek, suggest a respiratory infection. The patient's occupation as a painter and exposure to hay dust suggest a possible environmental exposure to fungal spores. The patient's recent-onset headache while reading may indicate a spread of the infection to the central nervous system. The chest radiography findings of nodular opacities in the right upper zone and bronchiectasis further support a respiratory infection. The punch biopsy results showing inflammatory infiltrate composed of giant cells in the deeper dermis extending into the subcutaneous fat, epithelioid cell granulomas, and fungal profiles within giant cells, are consistent with a fungal infection. The periodic acid-Schiff stain highlighting septate fungal hyphae with acute-angled branching within giant cells supports the diagnosis of a fungal infection.

**Reasoning**: The patient presents with multiple systemic lesions, including a large echogenic mass on the inferior aspect of the interatrial septum with infiltration of the coronary sinus, anterior mitral valve annulus, and aortic root, as well as a left hilar mass encasing the left upper lobe bronchus with extension into the left main pulmonary artery, a nodular soft tissue lesion along the anterior nasal septum, and a left paraclinoid mass lesion consistent with a meningioma and right Meckel cave lesions. The patient's history of Burkitt lymphoma and the presence of multiple lesions suggest a high likelihood of metastatic disease.

The next step would be to perform a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. Given the location of the lesions, a thoracoscopic biopsy of the hilar mass would be the most appropriate choice. This would allow for a minimally invasive approach to obtain a tissue sample for further analysis.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms and clinical findings, including a central corneal ulcer, diffuse microcystic corneal edema, and stromal thickening, suggest a diagnosis of microbial keratitis. The history of recent exposure to a freshwater lake increases the likelihood of an aquatic organism being the causative agent. The negative initial corneal cultures do not rule out the possibility of an infection, as the organism may not have been detected or may have been overgrown by other bacteria or fungi. In vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) was performed to evaluate the stromal infiltrate and aid in the diagnosis.

**Answer**: C: Voriconazole.

Given the patient's history and clinical presentation, it is likely that the causative agent is a fungus, such as Fusarium or Aspergillus. Voriconazole is a broad-spectrum antifungal medication that is effective against these types of fungi and is commonly used to treat fungal keratitis. While awaiting the results of the repeated corneal cultures, empirical treatment with voriconazole would be appropriate to cover the possible fungal etiology.

Sure, I'll do my best to answer your question. Here's my reasoning and answer:

**Reasoning**:
The patient presents with worsening vision in the left eye, along with findings of intraretinal thickening and schisis-like separation on OCT. These findings are concerning for a new-onset macular schisis, which can be caused by various factors, including glaucoma, uveitis, and retinal vein occlusion. The patient's history of primary open-angle glaucoma and previous trabeculectomies increases the likelihood that the schisis is related to glaucoma.

**Answer**: A. Pars plana vitrectomy.

In this case, the patient's new-onset macular schisis is likely related to glaucoma, and pars plana vitrectomy may be necessary to relieve the schisis and improve vision. Laser barricade (B) may be considered as an alternative treatment option, but it may not be as effective in relieving the schisis as pars plana vitrectomy. Observation (C) may be appropriate for some cases of macular schisis, but given the patient's symptoms and findings, it is not the most appropriate next step. Genetic testing for the RS1 gene (D) is not relevant to the patient's current condition and is not necessary at this time.

**Reasoning**:
The patient's symptoms of bilateral macular atrophy, hearing loss, and headache, along with the fundus autofluorescence and optical coherence tomography findings, suggest a possible diagnosis of a mitochondrial disease. Mitochondrial diseases can cause a wide range of symptoms, including vision and hearing loss, and can affect various parts of the body, including the retina and cochlea. It's important to note that the patient's family history does not suggest a clear inheritance pattern, which is consistent with mitochondrial diseases, which can have a variable inheritance pattern. Therefore, it's appropriate to consider genetic testing to rule out a mitochondrial disease.

**Reasoning**: The patient presents with sudden vision loss in the right eye, which is concerning for a potential retinal vascular event. The presence of blurred optic disc margins, tortuous and dilated retinal veins, and intraretinal hemorrhages in all quadrants on ophthalmoscopy, as well as the presence of cystoid macular edema on OCT, are consistent with a diagnosis of central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). The absence of any other obvious causes of vision loss, such as a retinal detachment or vitreous hemorrhage, supports this diagnosis. The patient's history of dyslipidemia increases her risk for cardiovascular disease, which could potentially contribute to the development of CRVO.

**Answer**: B: Perform a thoracoabdominopelvic computed tomography scan.

A thoracoabdominopelvic CT scan should be performed to rule out any underlying systemic conditions that may have contributed to the development of CRVO, such as a thrombotic event or aneurysm. This is particularly important given the patient's history of dyslipidemia and the potential for cardiovascular disease. Additionally, the CT scan can help to identify any other potential causes of vision loss, such as a carotid artery dissection or a posterior communicating artery aneurysm. Once the underlying cause of the CRVO has been identified, appropriate treatment can be initiated to manage the condition and prevent further vision loss.

**Reasoning**:
The patient's symptoms of a compressive neck mass with dyspnea while supine, along with the physical examination findings of a visible and palpable fullness in the right neck, suggest a possible thyroid or parathyroid mass. The ultrasonography and contrast-enhanced computed tomography scan results show a large, nonenhancing cystic lesion abutting the lateral and posterior margins of the right thyroid lobe, which is consistent with a parathyroid cyst. Additionally, the elevated parathyroid hormone level in the fine-needle aspirate supports this diagnosis.

The patient's history of allo-SCT for FLT3-mutated AML and chronic gastrointestinal graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) increases the likelihood of a complication related to the transplant. The presence of a right vocal fold neoplasm crossing the posterior commissure, with associated bilateral vocal fold motion impairment and obstruction of the glottic airway, supports a diagnosis of extramedullary myeloid sarcoma (EMM) of the larynx. EMM is a rare complication of allo-SCT, but it has been reported in the literature as a potential late effect of stem cell transplantation.

**Reasoning**: Given the patient's history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy with a depressed ejection fraction, acute kidney injury, and severe right pulmonary fibrosis, it is likely that the worsening cardiomyopathy is caused by progression of the underlying disease. The patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) shows alternating QRS morphologies, which suggests that the biventricular pacing may not be effectively capturing the ventricles. The chest radiography reveals that the pacemaker lead position is unchanged from implantation, which suggests that the lead has not migrated.

**Answer**: C: Change the LV pacing configuration.

The patient's worsening cardiomyopathy despite biventricular pacing suggests that the current pacing configuration may not be optimal. Changing the LV pacing configuration may help to improve the capture of the ventricles and reduce the risk of ventricular arrhythmias. Suppressing premature ventricular contractions (Option A) may not address the underlying issue of worsening cardiomyopathy. Increasing the basal pacing rate (Option B) may not be appropriate given the patient's current clinical status. Referring for LV lead repositioning (Option D) may be considered, but it is not the most appropriate next step given the patient's clinical status and the unchanged lead position.

Sure, I'll do my best to provide a well-structured answer. Here's my reasoning and answer:

**Reasoning**:
The patient presents with acute-onset, painless vision loss in his right eye, accompanied by tinnitus and severe intermittent headaches. His visual acuity is 20/400 OD and 20/30 OS, and his fundi show bilateral optic nerve edema. The patient has a history of hypertensive retinopathy, and recent imaging studies (CT/MRI) and lumbar puncture were reportedly normal. Given the patient's symptoms and history, it is likely that the optic nerve edema is caused by a bilateral disc edema masquerade.

The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with a bilateral disc edema masquerade, which can be caused by various conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and inflammatory conditions. The patient's history of hypertensive retinopathy increases the likelihood of a hypertension-related cause. The normal imaging studies and lumbar puncture results suggest that the cause is unlikely to be a space-occupying lesion or an inflammatory condition.

**Answer**: D: Continue acetazolamide and repeated Humphrey visual fields test and optical coherence tomography of the retinal nerve fiber layer in 3 months.

Given the patient's symptoms and examination findings, it is appropriate to continue the current treatment with acetazolamide and to monitor the patient's condition with repeated Humphrey visual fields tests and optical coherence tomography of the retinal nerve fiber layer. This will help to assess the progression of the disease and to identify any potential complications. Tighter blood pressure control (option A) may also be beneficial, but it is not the most appropriate next step in the patient's management. Repeated lumbar puncture with serologies (option B) is unlikely to provide additional useful information, given the patient's normal lumbar puncture results. High-dose corticosteroids (option C) may be considered in certain cases of bilateral disc edema

**Reasoning**: The patient presents with severe headaches and progressive bilateral vision loss, with no localizing signs on neurologic examination. The MRI and lumbar puncture results are unremarkable, and syphilis serologic tests are negative. The fundus examination shows bilateral creamy-yellow lesions in the peripheral retina, with discrete nummular lesions in the posterior pole. These findings suggest a possible diagnosis of uveitis or retinitis, which can cause vision loss if left untreated.

**Answer**: B: Send for infectious and inflammatory tests, begin oral prednisone therapy, and follow up in 1 week. This answer choice allows for further evaluation and management of the patient's symptoms, while also considering the possibility of an infectious or inflammatory etiology. Oral prednisone therapy can help reduce inflammation and prevent further vision loss, while follow-up in 1 week allows for monitoring of the patient's response to treatment and adjustment of management as needed.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of painless central scotoma and worsening floaters, along with the physical examination findings of a white macular lesion, disc edema, and hemorrhages, suggest a possible infectious or inflammatory process in the eye. The fact that the patient had recently undergone pars plana vitrectomy with gas tamponade and had received intravitreal injection of triamcinolone acetonide and ceftazidime increases the likelihood of an infectious process. The presence of a residual epiretinal membrane on optical coherence tomography also supports this diagnosis.

Therefore, the next step would be to perform a vitreous tap and injection of intravitreal antibiotics to treat the possible infection. This would help to alleviate the patient's symptoms and prevent further damage to the eye.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms of blurred vision and corneal edema after phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation suggest a possible diagnosis of nonclearing corneal edema. The patient's age and history of nuclear sclerotic cataracts also increase the likelihood of this diagnosis. The patient's current treatment with topical prednisolone acetate has not been effective in improving their symptoms.

Therefore, the next step in management would be to consider alternative treatments for nonclearing corneal edema. Option B, Provide medical management with topical corticosteroids and hypertonic saline solution for an additional 3 months, is not the most appropriate choice as the patient has already been treated with topical corticosteroids without improvement.

Option A, Perform penetrating keratoplasty, may be considered in cases where the corneal edema is severe and not responsive to other treatments. However, it is not the first line of treatment for nonclearing corneal edema and carries a higher risk of complications compared to other options.

Option C, Obtain an anterior-segment optical coherence tomogram, may be useful in evaluating the severity of the corneal edema and assessing the effectiveness of treatment. However, it is not the most appropriate next step in management.

Option D, Perform an endothelial keratoplasty (Descemet stripping and endothelial keratoplasty or Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty), is a surgical procedure that may be considered in cases of nonclearing corneal edema that are caused by endothelial dysfunction. It is a less invasive procedure compared to penetrating keratoplasty and may be effective in improving symptoms and visual acuity.

Therefore, the best answer is:

**Answer**: D: Perform an endothelial keratoplasty (Descemet stripping and endothelial keratoplasty or Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty).

**Reasoning**: The patient presents with acute unilateral painless vision loss, which is concerning for frosted branch angiitis, a severe form of retinal vasculitis. The presence of purpuric rash on the hands and feet, digital ischemia, and perivenular exudates on fundus examination support this diagnosis. The patient's history of immunosuppression and recent increase in dosage of azathioprine suggest that the vision loss may be related to an adverse effect of the medication.

**Answer**: B: Diagnostic anterior chamber paracentesis and intravitreal foscarnet.

Anterior chamber paracentesis can help to confirm the diagnosis of frosted branch angiitis by identifying inflammatory cells in the aqueous humor. Intravitreal foscarnet can be used to treat the condition by reducing inflammation and preventing further vision loss. It is important to note that the patient's systemic immunosuppression may need to be adjusted, but this should be done in consultation with the patient's primary care physician or a specialist in immunosuppression management.

**Reasoning**: The patient's symptoms, such as rapidly growing, widespread, asymptomatic skin nodules all over his body, and the fact that the patient had no history of malignant neoplasm or chemical exposure, suggest a diagnosis of aleukemic cutaneous myeloid sarcoma. The elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase level and the histologic findings of diffuse dermal infiltrates extending to the subcutis, with sparing of the upper papillary dermis, and characterized by immature myeloid cells, further support this diagnosis.

**Answer**: A. Aleukemic cutaneous myeloid sarcoma.

**Reasoning**:
The patient presented with a slowly enlarging neck mass, which is a common symptom of various head and neck lesions. The location of the mass near the angle of the mandible and the absence of any skin changes or drainage suggest a parotid gland origin. The patient's history of recurrent upper respiratory infections and previous adenotonsillectomy and ear tube placement may indicate a possible infectious or inflammatory etiology for the mass. However, the patient's persistent pain and increasing size of the mass suggest a more likely neoplastic origin. The ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging results support this suspicion, as they show a well-defined, heterogeneous intraparotid nodule with internal and marginal vascularity. The fine needle aspiration biopsy results, which demonstrated benign-appearing salivary gland tissue and clusters of myoepithelial cells, further support a diagnosis of a parotid gland neoplasm.

The gross and histologic findings of the excised parotid mass are consistent with a diagnosis of acinic cell carcinoma. The well-demarcated solid nodule with tan-white, glistening cut surfaces and the multilobulated, complex lesion with prominent stromal fibrosis and collections of ductal structures with varying degrees of cystic change are characteristic features of acinic cell carcinoma. Additionally, the presence of brightly eosinophilic intracytoplasmic granules in the acinar cells is a distinctive feature of this tumor type.

Therefore, based on the patient's clinical presentation, imaging results, and histopathologic findings, the diagnosis is:

**Answer**: A. Acinic cell carcinoma.

**Reasoning**: The patient's history of systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, and recent kidney transplant suggest a possible immune-mediated etiology for the perianal ulcers. The presence of thrombocytopenia and recent acute cellular transplant rejection also support this possibility. The absence of ocular or oral ulcers and the presence of a clean base suggest that the ulcers are not due to herpes simplex virus infection. The patient's recent use of immunosuppressive medications, including prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil, may have contributed to the development of the ulcers. The patient's history of external hemorrhoids increases the likelihood that the ulcers are cutaneous Crohn disease.
**Answer**: D: Cutaneous Crohn disease.
