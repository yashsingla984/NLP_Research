Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of intermittent apneic episodes, bilateral rhonchi, and altered mental status, along with the presence of coin-shaped opacities in the stomach on chest radiograph, suggest a possible foreign body ingestion or aspiration. The appropriate next step would be to arrange for an endoscopy to evaluate the presence of a foreign body and assess the extent of any potential damage to the gastrointestinal tract. Administering activated charcoal (option A) may not be effective in this case as the patient's symptoms are already present, and it may not be able to reach the foreign body in time. Performing gastric lavage (option C) may also not be appropriate as it may push the foreign body further into the gastrointestinal tract and cause more harm. Providing supportive care (option D) is important, but it should not be the first step in this situation.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of persistent fever, neck pain, and air tracking towards the left lobe of the thyroid gland on the CT scan suggest the presence of an abscess in the thyroid gland. Emphysematous thyroiditis is a rare condition where gas accumulates within the thyroid gland, often as a result of bacterial infection. The patient's history of a recent esophageal foreign body and the presence of air in the thyroid gland on the CT scan support this diagnosis. Parapharyngeal and retropharyngeal abscesses are less likely given the location of the foreign body and the absence of symptoms such as difficulty swallowing or hoarseness. Mediastinitis is also less likely as the patient does not have symptoms of a mediastinal infection such as chest pain or cough.

Answer: C
Explanation: The clinical presentation of acute-onset painful scattered umbilicated papulopustules and ovoid ulcerated plaques with elevated, pink borders on the face, trunk, and extremities, along with a new-onset cough, is consistent with molluscum contagiosum. The Tzanck smear shows ballooning of keratinocytes and peripheralization of nuclear material, which is consistent with a viral infection such as molluscum contagiosum. The patient's significant immunocompromise due to AIDS increases the likelihood of this diagnosis. Herpes simplex virus (A) may also cause similar lesions, but the absence of fever and other systemic symptoms makes it less likely. Histoplasmosis (B) typically presents with respiratory symptoms and is less likely to cause the described skin lesions. Mpox (D) is a rare disease that can cause skin lesions, but it is not typically associated with immunocompromise and is not consistent with the described clinical presentation.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's peripheral blood smear shows a significant number of immature myeloblasts (6% to 8% blast forms), which is highly suggestive of myeloid leukemia. The flow cytometry results also support this diagnosis, as they identify a small population of CD34+/CD117+ cells, which are markers of immature myeloblasts. Given the patient's history of bladder carcinoma and atrial fibrillation, it is likely that the myeloid leukemia is a result of chemotherapy-induced damage to the bone marrow.

Therefore, the best course of action would be to repeat the complete blood cell count with differential in 1 to 2 weeks to monitor the patient's response to chemotherapy and assess for any changes in the peripheral blasts. This will help guide further management decisions, such as whether to continue or modify the current chemotherapy regimen, or consider alternative treatments such as bone marrow transplantation.

Option A, performing a bone marrow biopsy, may also be considered, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. While a bone marrow biopsy can provide valuable information about the bone marrow microenvironment and help confirm the diagnosis of myeloid leukemia, it is not necessary at this point in the patient's management. The patient's peripheral blood smear and flow cytometry results are already highly suggestive of myeloid leukemia, and a bone marrow biopsy may not provide significant additional information.

Option B, prescribing all-trans retinoic acid, is not appropriate in this case. All-trans retinoic acid is a chemotherapy agent that is used to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia, a type of myeloid leukemia that is characterized by the presence of promyelocytes. However, the patient's peripheral blood smear and flow cytometry results do not suggest the presence of promyelocytes, and therefore all-trans retinoic acid would not be an appropriate treatment option at this time.

Option D, starting cytoreductive therapy with hydroxyurea,

Answer: C. Perineural spread of cutaneous malignancy.
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive cranial neuropathy, including facial numbness and weakness, vision changes, and headaches, are consistent with perineural spread of a cutaneous malignancy. The patient's history of multiple cutaneous squamous and basal cell carcinomas, including a completely excised left cheek melanoma, increases the likelihood of this diagnosis. The fact that the patient's symptoms began 5 years after the excision of the melanoma suggests a delayed presentation of the perineural spread. The patient's right-sided ptosis and severe facial weakness in a lower motor neuron pattern, as well as the fixed and dilated pupil, are also consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of type 2 diabetes and hyperlipidemia may increase the risk of perineural spread. The negative results for infection and autoimmune disease and the mildly elevated protein values in the CSF studies further support this diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of intermittent itching and night sweats, along with the physical examination findings of left cervical and inguinal masses, and the laboratory results of marked leukocytosis, eosinophilia, and elevated vitamin B12, are consistent with T-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia (T-ALL). The patient's age and the presence of a high white blood cell count and eosinophilia also support this diagnosis. The bone marrow biopsy findings of hypercellular marrow, myeloid hyperplasia, increased eosinophils with some dysplasia, and a blast count of 2% are also consistent with T-ALL. The positron emission tomographic–computed tomographic (PET/CT) scan showing a left upper cervical lymph node of 2.6 cm and a left inguinal lymph node of 3.1 × 2.3 cm with an standardized uptake value max of 5.7, and the lymph node biopsy immunohistochemical stain with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization for FIP1L1::PDGFRA rearrangement (positive), further support the diagnosis of T-ALL. Therefore, option C, T-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia, is the correct answer.

Answer: B
Explanation: Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease, also known as histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis, is a rare condition that is characterized by the combination of lymphadenopathy, fever, and skin eruption. The pathological findings of extensive coagulative necrosis, apoptosis, and karyorrhectic debris in the lymph nodes, as well as the absence of neutrophils and hematoxylin bodies, are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's history of α-thalassemia may also be a relevant factor, as Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease has been associated with certain genetic disorders. The other options, lymphoma, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Rosai-Dorfman disease, can also present with lymphadenopathy and skin eruptions, but the combination of symptoms and pathological findings in this case is most consistent with Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease.

Answer: D
Explanation: The patient's presentation of ventricular tachycardia, syncope, and hemoptysis, along with a history of breast cancer and pulmonary nodules, suggests a high likelihood of an underlying cardiac condition. The patient's age and history of cancer also increase the likelihood of a cardiac arrhythmia. Given the patient's unstable vital signs and the presence of a regular wide complex tachycardia with a left bundle branch block morphology, it is appropriate to consider implantation of a cardiac defibrillator to prevent sudden cardiac death. While cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (Option A) may be useful in evaluating the patient's cardiac function and identifying any scar tissue, it is not the most urgent step in managing the patient's arrhythmia. Electrophysiology study (Option B) may be considered in the future to assess the patient's arrhythmia mechanism and potential for catheter ablation, but it is not the most appropriate next step. Genetic testing (Option C) may be considered if there is a suspicion of a genetic disorder contributing to the patient's arrhythmia, but it is not the most pressing concern given the patient's symptoms and history.

Answer: C. Diffuse-type neurofibroma.
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of headaches and visual-spatial difficulties, along with the physical examination findings of a progressively enlarging lesion on the left scalp, are consistent with a diagnosis of diffuse-type neurofibroma. The MRI and angiography results also support this diagnosis, as they show a hypervascular mass with prominent vascularity and underlying calvarial thickening, without any osseous destruction or intracranial extension. Additionally, the positive staining for S100 and SOX10 immunostains is consistent with a diagnosis of neurofibroma.

It is important to note that the patient's age and lack of significant nuclear pleomorphism or mitotic activity also support the diagnosis of diffuse-type neurofibroma, as this type of neurofibroma typically affects young adults and has a more indolent course compared to other types of neurofibromas.

The other options, arteriovenous malformation of the scalp (A), solitary fibrous tumor (B), and dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (D), can be excluded based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and imaging results. Arteriovenous malformation would typically have a more rapid growth rate and would likely cause more severe neurological symptoms, such as seizures or stroke-like episodes. Solitary fibrous tumor is a rare entity that typically affects the thorax or abdomen and is not usually associated with scalp lesions. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is a cutaneous malignancy that typically affects the skin and subcutaneous tissue, and is not associated with scalp lesions or the findings described in this case.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including the development of erythematous scaly plaques on the face and proximal extremities, palatal perforation, stridor, and wheezing, are consistent with blastomycosis, a fungal infection caused by Blastomyces dermatitidis. The patient's history of respiratory symptoms and the physical examination findings of saddle nose deformity and necrotic plaques on the ear are also consistent with this diagnosis. The histopathological analysis and culture results shown in Figure C, which reveal an infiltrate of foamy histiocytes and pigmented yeasts without multiaxial septation, are also consistent with blastomycosis. Therefore, option C, Blastomycosis, is the correct answer.

Option A, Chromoblastomycosis, is a type of fungal infection caused by Fonsecaea pedrosoi, which typically affects the skin and subcutaneous tissue. While it can cause similar symptoms to blastomycosis, such as skin lesions and respiratory symptoms, it is less likely to cause palatal perforation and stridor.

Option B, Hyalohyphomycosis, is a type of fungal infection caused by Hyalohyphomyces variabilis, which typically affects the skin and subcutaneous tissue. It can cause skin lesions and respiratory symptoms, but it is less likely to cause palatal perforation and stridor.

Option D, Phaeohyphomycosis, is a type of fungal infection caused by various species of dematiaceous fungi, which typically affects the skin and subcutaneous tissue. While it can cause skin lesions and respiratory symptoms, it is less likely to cause palatal perforation and stridor.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of seizures, left-sided otorrhea, otalgia, and hearing loss, along with the imaging findings of diffuse enhancement and possible coalescence in the left mastoid process with adjacent dural enhancement and sigmoid sinus occlusion, are consistent with acute coalescent mastoiditis with sigmoid sinus thrombosis. The histopathological findings of cells with oval nuclei and abundant cytoplasm arranged in syncytial clusters with occasional whorls, pseudoinclusions, and psammomatous calcifications, and positive immunohistochemical stains for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and vimentin, support the diagnosis of mastoiditis. Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's age and the absence of characteristic histopathological features such as Langerhans cells. Meningioma is unlikely given the absence of meninges involvement. Cholesteatoma is also unlikely given the absence of characteristic histopathological features such as keratinizing squamous epithelium and cholesterol clefts.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with leprosy. The patient's history of travel to Guyana, where leprosy is endemic, and the presence of subcutaneous nodules and neck cellulitis, which are common manifestations of leprosy, support this diagnosis. Additionally, the negative results for other infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis and bacterial pharyngitis, suggest that the patient's symptoms are not caused by another condition. The patient's failure to respond to empirical treatment with antibiotics and the presence of granulomatous inflammation on biopsy also support the diagnosis of leprosy. Leishmaniasis and tuberculosis can also cause granulomatous inflammation, but the patient's history and symptoms are not consistent with these diagnoses. Lethal midline granuloma is a rare condition that can cause similar symptoms, but it is not associated with travel to endemic areas or exposure to acid-fast bacillus, and the patient's age and lack of other symptoms make it less likely. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is leprosy.

Answer: D
Explanation: The patient's history of mycosis fungoides and the presence of hyperpigmented patches on the skin and mucous membranes suggest that the oral mucosal pigmentation is likely a result of the disease's progression. Mycosis fungoides can involve the oral mucosa, causing pigmentation changes, and it is not uncommon for patients with advanced disease to experience oral involvement. The patient's previous treatment with romidepsin and pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, which were not effective in controlling the disease, also supports this diagnosis. Laugier-Hunziker syndrome (A) is a rare condition characterized by pigmentation of the oral mucosa, but it is not associated with mycosis fungoides. Melanoma (B) is a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's history of mycosis fungoides and the absence of other signs of melanoma. Medication adverse effect (C) is also a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's history of disease progression and the absence of other signs of medication toxicity.

Answer: D: Exploration of conjunctiva and removal of foreign body.
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and signs, such as the "pulling and popping" sensation in his left eye, the irregular serpiginous extension from beneath the plica semilunaris toward the corneal limbus with localized conjunctival hyperemia, and the recent swelling of the left side of his face with associated numbness and occasional swelling of his left hand, are consistent with a conjunctival foreign body. The patient's history of a similar episode 5 years ago, which was diagnosed as allergic conjunctivitis, suggests that he may have had a previous exposure to a foreign body. The absence of any conjunctival hyperemia, foreign bodies, or other abnormalities on slitlamp examination does not rule out the presence of a foreign body, as it may have been removed or dislodged before the examination. The patient's mild eosinophilia may also be indicative of a parasitic infection, such as onchocerciasis, which can cause conjunctival foreign bodies. Therefore, the next step would be to perform an exploration of the conjunctiva and removal of the foreign body, if present, to alleviate the patient's symptoms and prevent any further complications.

Explanation: The patient's history of elephantiasis nostras verrucosa, a condition characterized by thickening and hardening of the skin, and the physical examination findings of multiple firm skin-colored papules and nodules coalescing to form a large plaque on the anterior aspect of the left lower leg, are consistent with the diagnosis of elephantiasis nostras verrucosa. Additionally, the patient's history of morbid obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and stroke increases the likelihood of this diagnosis. The other options, pretibial myxedema, lobomycosis, and euthyroid pretibial mucinosis, can also cause skin thickening and nodules, but do not fit the patient's history and physical examination findings as well as elephantiasis nostras verrucosa.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation, family history, and histopathological findings are consistent with a diagnosis of familial cerebral cavernous malformations. The patient's bluish, partially keratotic papules and nodules on the lower legs, lipolymphedema of the lower legs, and positive family history of cerebral venous malformations involving the patient's father and aunt, are all consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the sonography of the skin lesions demonstrated intradermal slow-flow vascular malformations, which is also consistent with familial cerebral cavernous malformations. The patient's history of recurrent seizures and hemiparesis/hemianopsia also support this diagnosis.

The other options do not fit the patient's clinical presentation and family history. Blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome is a rare condition characterized by multiple soft, bluish papules and nodules on the skin, but it is not associated with neurological symptoms or a positive family history of cerebral venous malformations. Glomuvenous malformations are benign vascular tumors that can occur in the skin, but they are not typically associated with neurological symptoms or a positive family history of cerebral venous malformations. Verrucous venous malformations are characterized by slow-flow vascular malformations in the skin, but they are not typically associated with neurological symptoms or a positive family history of cerebral venous malformations.

Answer: C: Plaque radiotherapy 
Explanation: Based on the clinical case presented, the most appropriate next step would be to perform plaque radiotherapy. The patient has a history of cutaneous basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, which suggests a higher risk of developing uveal melanoma. The presence of an amelanotic fundus lesion in the left eye, along with the shallow circumferential buckle effect and the inferotemporal mass, raises suspicion for choroidal melanoma. Plaque radiotherapy is a common treatment for uveal melanoma and would be appropriate in this case to prevent further growth and potential metastasis. Whole-body positron emission tomography scan (Option A) may be useful in detecting any potential metastasis, but it would not be the next step in management. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (Option B) may not be feasible or necessary given the location and size of the lesion. Observation (Option D) would not be appropriate given the suspicion for choroidal melanoma and the potential for vision loss if left untreated.

Answer: C 
Explanation: The clinical presentation of multiple itchy erythematous papules and plaques localized to one shin, with histopathological findings of dermoepidermal separation and milia, is consistent with epidermolysis bullosa pruriginosa (EBP). EBP is a rare autoimmune bullous disorder characterized by pruritic papules and plaques with a predilection for the extensor surfaces, particularly the shins. The histopathological features of dermoepidermal separation and milia are also typical of EBP. Pretibial pruritic papular dermatitis (PPPD) typically presents with smaller, more numerous lesions and is more commonly seen on the lower legs. Hypertrophic lichen planus (HLP) typically has a more widespread distribution and may have a rough, scaly texture. Lichen amyloidosis (LA) typically presents with more widespread, symmetrical, and asymptomatic deposits of amyloid in the skin, without the characteristic histopathological findings of EBP.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and findings, including painless vision loss, central scotoma, and optic disc swelling, are consistent with infectious neuroretinitis. The presence of a macular star and retinal vein dilation also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of recurrent urinary tract infections increases the likelihood of a systemic infection that may have spread to the eye. Therefore, it is appropriate to order serologic testing to confirm the diagnosis of infectious neuroretinitis. Prescribing systemic corticosteroids (option A) may be considered after the diagnosis is confirmed, but it is not the most appropriate next step. Ruling out a brain tumor (option C) is not directly related to the patient's symptoms and findings, and checking blood pressure (option D) is not likely to provide useful information in this case.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and the results of the MRI are consistent with a diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma. Rhabdomyosarcoma is a type of cancer that develops in the soft tissues of the body, such as muscles, tendons, and connective tissue. It is a malignant tumor that can occur in various parts of the body, including the head and neck. The patient's age and the fact that the mass has been present since birth also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the MRI findings of a uniformly solid and well-circumscribed mass without cystic components or flow voids, and the homogeneous contrast enhancement on T1, are consistent with rhabdomyosarcoma. Hemangioma (A) is a benign tumor of blood vessels, and would not explain the patient's symptoms or MRI findings. Rhabdomyoma (B) is a benign tumor of muscle origin, and would not explain the patient's age or the MRI findings. Teratoma (D) is a type of germ cell tumor, and would not explain the patient's symptoms or MRI findings.

Explanation: The patient's history of a similar episode of rash and delayed wound healing after laparoscopy 1 year prior to presentation, along with the negative skin swab bacterial culture result, suggests that the current rash and poor wound healing may be related to a viral infection. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a common cause of viral exanthemata and can cause a papulovesicular rash similar to the one described in the case. Acyclovir, an antiviral medication, would be effective in treating HSV infection and promoting wound healing. Therefore, the best next step would be to prescribe acyclovir (400 mg orally 3 times daily for 7 days).

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as painful necrotic skin lesions, nonproductive cough, and altered mental status, along with the physical examination findings of dusky, purpuric, and pink papulonodules, are consistent with invasive aspergillosis. The patient's history of severe mucositis, acute kidney injury, and neutropenic fever, as well as the CT scan findings of multifocal bilateral ground-glass patchy opacities and a moderately sized pericardial effusion, also support this diagnosis. The biopsy specimen from a skin nodule on the left lateral thigh showed septated hyphae and oval microconidia, which are consistent with Aspergillus species. Therefore, option B, invasive aspergillosis, is the most likely diagnosis.

Option A, disseminated fusariosis, is less likely as the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are not consistent with this diagnosis. Fusariosis typically presents with fever, chills, and skin lesions that are not necessarily painful.

Option C, pseudomonal ecthyma gangrenosum, is also less likely as the patient's skin lesions are not consistent with this diagnosis. Pseudomonal ecthyma gangrenosum typically presents with small, painless, brown-black papules or pustules on the skin.

Option D, Sweet syndrome, is unlikely as the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are not consistent with this diagnosis. Sweet syndrome typically presents with fever, severe headache, and a characteristic rash on the face, neck, and extremities.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's history of primary salivary duct carcinoma of the hard palate and recent radiotherapy treatment suggest that the current lesion may be a radiation-induced effect. Acquired angiokeratomas (option C) are benign vascular lesions that can arise in response to radiation therapy. They typically appear as red or purple papules or nodules and may have a characteristic "sausage-like" or "cobblestone" appearance on histopathology. The patient's lesion, which is composed of multiple infiltrative papules and nodules with varying sizes, is consistent with this diagnosis. In contrast, radiotherapy-induced epithelioid angiosarcoma (option A) is a rare and aggressive malignancy that can arise in previously irradiated tissue. It typically has a more aggressive growth pattern and would be unlikely to present with the gradual progression and asymptomatic nature described in this case. Kaposi sarcoma (option B) is a malignant vascular tumor that can occur in immunosuppressed individuals, but it is not typically associated with radiation therapy. Carcinoma hemorrhagiectoides (option D) is a rare and aggressive variant of squamous cell carcinoma that can present with hemorrhagic and erythematous plaques, but it is not typically associated with radiation therapy.

Answer: C
Explanation: The clinical presentation and histopathological findings described in the case are consistent with a diagnosis of bullous pilomatricoma. The patient's age and the location of the tumor on the right upper arm are also consistent with this diagnosis. Bullous pilomatricoma is a rare benign tumor that typically affects young adults and children, and it often presents as a slowly growing, painless mass on the skin, particularly on the extremities. The tumor has a characteristic "bullous" appearance, with a red, semitransparent, and shiny surface, and it may have a firm or hard consistency. The histopathological findings in this case, including the presence of basophilic cells and shadow cells, as well as dilated lymphatic vessels, are also consistent with a diagnosis of bullous pilomatricoma. In contrast, matrical carcinoma is a rare type of skin cancer that typically affects older adults and is characterized by a rapidly growing, painless mass on the skin, often with a ulcerated surface. Panfolliculoma is a rare benign tumor that affects the skin and is characterized by a slowly growing, painless mass that is usually located on the face or neck. Trichodiscoma is a rare benign tumor that affects the hair follicles and is characterized by a slowly growing, painless mass that is usually located on the scalp.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's presentation of unilateral exudative retinal lesion, along with the presence of a vascular papule on her cheek and a history of lightly pigmented patches of skin and subungual fibromas on her toes, suggests a diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). TSC is a genetic disorder that affects the growth and development of organs, including the brain, heart, kidneys, and eyes. The retinal lesion in this case is consistent with a type 1 astrocytic hamartoma, which is a common feature of TSC. The presence of bulblike telangiectasis on fluorescein angiography and the associated macular edema also support this diagnosis. Therefore, the next step would be to order a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to look for associated central nervous system tumors, which is the most appropriate answer (B). Initiating anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment (A) may be considered later if the patient's condition warrants it, but it is not the most urgent step at this point. Performing a hypercoagulable workup (C) and ordering an echocardiogram and carotid ultrasonography (D) may also be necessary, but they are not the most appropriate next steps given the patient's presentation and suspected diagnosis.

Answer: D: Prescribe 10 days of prednisone (60 mg daily)
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of dysphagia, weight loss, cough productive of yellow sputum, dyspnea on exertion, and fatigue, along with the physical examination findings of a maculopapular rash over the neck and chest and bibasilar crackles on lung auscultation, are consistent with a diagnosis of pulmonary disease. The laboratory test results, including an elevated white blood cell count, creatine kinase level, aldolase level, C-reactive protein level, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, support this diagnosis. The chest CT scan showing bibasilar pulmonary consolidations and ground glass opacities further supports a diagnosis of interstitial lung disease. The patient's history of Raynaud disease and positive antinuclear antibody immunofluorescent assay findings suggest a possible autoimmune disorder. Given these findings, prescribing 10 days of prednisone (60 mg daily) would be an appropriate next step in the patient's management, as it may help to reduce inflammation in the lungs and improve symptoms.

Arranging a percutaneous lung tissue biopsy (option A) may be considered, but it is not the most appropriate next step in the patient's management, as the diagnosis of interstitial lung disease is already supported by the clinical and laboratory findings. Checking an antisynthetase antibody panel (option B) may also be considered, but it is not the most appropriate next step, as the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are not consistent with a diagnosis of an antisynthetase syndrome. Performing a quadriceps muscle biopsy (option C) is not relevant to the patient's current symptoms and diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of dysphagia and mild dyspnea, along with the physical examination findings of fullness in the left oropharynx and neck, and the computed tomography imaging results of a heterogeneously enhancing mass in the left oropharynx and hypopharynx with cystic components, are consistent with a diagnosis of a pediatric fibromyxoid soft tissue tumor (PFMST). PFMSTs are rare, slow-growing tumors that typically occur in the soft tissues of the head and neck, and can cause symptoms such as dysphagia, dyspnea, and neck mass. They are usually benign, but can be locally aggressive and infiltrate surrounding tissues. The patient's age and the location of the mass in the oropharynx and hypopharynx also support this diagnosis.

Perineurioma (A) is a rare benign tumor that arises from the peripheral nerves, usually in the head and neck. It is unlikely to cause the symptoms and findings described in the patient.

Fibroblastic lipoblastoma (B) is a rare benign tumor that usually occurs in the soft tissues of the extremities, and is unlikely to cause the symptoms and findings described in the patient.

Schwannoma (D) is a benign tumor that arises from the supporting cells of the peripheral nerves, and is unlikely to cause the symptoms and findings described in the patient.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of sudden-onset bilateral mydriasis, ophthalmoplegia, and diminished reflexes, along with the physical examination findings of fixed and dilated pupils, sluggish but reactive pupils, and unsteady gait, are consistent with a diagnosis of acute ophthalmoplegic migraine. This is a rare but well-known complication of migraine, which can be associated with anti-GQ1b antibodies. The presence of diffuse enhancement of the lower thoracic and cauda equina nerve roots and enhancement of the left oculomotor nerve on MRI supports this diagnosis. Intravenous immune globulin is a recommended treatment for acute ophthalmoplegic migraine, as it can help to reduce inflammation and prevent further nerve damage. Therefore, the best next step would be to order anti-GQ1b antibody and start intravenous immune globulin. Repeat blood cultures and lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid studies may not provide additional useful information, and starting intravenous corticosteroids may not be effective in treating the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and imaging results are consistent with a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The fungating and ulcerated mass on the left shoulder, with a high mitotic rate (18 mitoses/mm2) and positive SOX10 immunostaining, are characteristic features of SCC. Additionally, the absence of a personal or familial history of cancer and the patient's occupation as a construction worker, suggest that the tumor is likely to be associated with exposure to carcinogens such as UV radiation and chemicals. The patient's age of 46 years also falls within the typical age range for SCC diagnosis. While Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and Melanoma (C) can also present with skin lesions, they typically have a different clinical appearance and histopathological features. Merkel cell carcinoma (D) is a rare type of skin cancer that typically affects the elderly and has a more aggressive clinical course than SCC. Therefore, option A, Squamous cell carcinoma, is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of left shoulder pain, stiffness, and reduced range of motion, along with the physical examination findings of mild tenderness, reduced abduction and flexion, and atrophic scapular muscles, suggest a possible diagnosis of a shoulder joint disorder. The radiograph showing complete absence of the left humeral head and a well-demarcated smooth osseous margin of the proximal humerus with associated soft tissue swelling and periarticular calcification, supports the diagnosis of a destructive lesion of the shoulder joint. Given the patient's history of thoracolumbar scoliosis and previous surgical decompression for syringomyelia, it is likely that the destructive lesion is related to a chronic condition such as osteonecrosis or avascular necrosis.

Therefore, the next step would be to obtain an orthopedic surgery evaluation for shoulder replacement surgery, which is option C. This would allow for a thorough assessment of the patient's shoulder joint and surrounding tissue, as well as a determination of the best course of treatment, which may include surgical intervention.

Option A, obtaining an MRI of the left shoulder, may also be useful in evaluating the extent of the destructive lesion and assessing for any soft tissue abnormalities. However, given the patient's symptoms and radiographic findings, it is likely that the MRI would primarily serve to confirm the diagnosis, rather than provide new information.

Option B, ordering serum tumor marker testing, is not directly relevant to the patient's symptoms or radiographic findings, and is therefore not the most appropriate next step.

Option D, performing an urgent left shoulder joint aspiration, may be considered in cases of suspected infection or inflammatory conditions affecting the joint. However, given the patient's history and physical examination findings, it is unlikely that aspiration would provide valuable diagnostic information or improve the patient's symptoms.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient presented with acute pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, and nausea, which are symptoms consistent with acute coronary syndrome. The electrocardiogram showed subcentimeter ST-segment elevation in leads I and aVL and 1-mm ST-segment depression in leads II, III, aVF, and V5 through V6, indicating myocardial ischemia. The high-sensitivity troponin level was elevated at 110,000 ng/mL, further supporting the diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome. Cardiac point-of-care ultrasonography showed a severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of 40%, with hypokinesis of the anterolateral and posterior walls, indicating left ventricular dysfunction. Emergent cardiac catheterization revealed spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) of the left main coronary artery. Given the severity of the patient's symptoms and the presence of SCAD, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) would be the most appropriate next step in management. PCI can be used to treat SCAD by opening up the blocked vessel and restoring blood flow to the heart. In this case, PCI would be preferred over coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) because it is a less invasive procedure and the patient is relatively young and healthy. Medical management with medications such as beta blockers, nitrates, and antiplatelet agents may also be considered, but PCI would be the most urgent intervention needed to address the acute coronary syndrome. Observation would not be appropriate given the severity of the patient's symptoms and the presence of SCAD.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's presentation of diffuse erythematous, edematous annular plaques, low-grade fevers, and mild leukopenia, along with a history of SCLE and lack of response to various treatments, suggests a diagnosis of Histiocytoid Sweet syndrome. This is a rare condition characterized by the infiltration of histiocytes in the skin, leading to the formation of papules, plaques, and nodules. The patient's history of SCLE and treatment with various medications, including prednisone, which appeared to elicit a response, supports this diagnosis. The absence of other symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, and joint pain, which are commonly associated with systemic autoimmune diseases, also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's mild neutropenia and lymphopenia, as well as the elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, are consistent with Histiocytoid Sweet syndrome. VEXAS syndrome, drug-induced SCLE, and Halogenoderma are less likely diagnoses given the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory results.

Answer: B
Explanation: Inherited cutis laxa syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by loose, wrinkled, and inelastic skin, often with a characteristic "sagging" appearance. The patient's history of progressive skin laxity, beginning in early childhood and affecting flexural areas, is consistent with this diagnosis. The presence of yellowish papules on the dorsal neck, axillae, inguinal regions, abdomen, and limbs also supports this diagnosis, as these papules are typically seen in cutis laxa. The patient's family history, with her younger sister also affected, suggests an inherited pattern. The low clotting activity of factor X and prolonged prothrombin time may indicate a coagulation disorder, which could be a contributing factor to the skin symptoms. Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (Option A) is a similar condition, but it typically presents with more widespread and severe skin symptoms, including papillary calcification, and is often associated with ocular and cardiovascular manifestations, which are not mentioned in this case. A pseudoxanthoma elasticum–like disorder with coagulation deficiency (Option C) is possible, but the absence of other systemic manifestations and the patient's family history suggest inherited cutis laxa syndrome as the more likely diagnosis.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest the possibility of an echinococcal infection. Echinococcus granulosus is a parasite that can cause hydatid disease, which typically affects the liver and lungs. The patient's exposure to dogs, cattle, and sheep increases the likelihood of this diagnosis. The presence of a large pulmonary cyst and liver cysts on CT scan supports this diagnosis. Serologic testing for E granulosus antibodies (option B) would help confirm the diagnosis. Stool testing for Echinococcus eggs (option A) may also be useful, but it is not as specific as serologic testing. Lung biopsy (option C) may be necessary if the diagnosis is still uncertain after serologic testing, but it is not the most appropriate next step. Liver biopsy (option D) is not necessary at this time, as the patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a pulmonary rather than hepatic focus of infection.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including skin lesions, numbness, and hand contractures, are consistent with Hansen's disease, also known as leprosy. The fact that the patient immigrated from Samoa, where Hansen's disease is still prevalent, increases the likelihood of this diagnosis. The negative results for rapid plasma reagin, antinuclear antibodies, and rheumatoid factor rule out other potential causes of these symptoms, such as syphilis or autoimmune disorders. The granulomatous periadnexal and perivascular dermatitis with diffuse granulomatous infiltrate and foamy histiocytes observed in the skin biopsy also support the diagnosis of Hansen's disease. Therefore, the next step would be to send the skin biopsy specimen to the US National Hansen’s Disease Program for PCR testing to confirm the diagnosis. This is the most appropriate answer among the given options.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of heart failure, neuropathy, and spinal stenosis, along with the laboratory results of high-sensitivity troponin, brain-type natriuretic peptide, and abnormal liver enzymes, suggests a potential diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis. Genetic testing would be appropriate to confirm the diagnosis, as it can identify the presence of amyloidogenic transthyretin (TTR) mutations. Bone marrow biopsy may also be useful in the diagnostic workup, but it would not be the next best step. Random skin biopsies and 24-hour urine testing for monoclonal proteins are not typically used in the diagnostic evaluation of cardiac amyloidosis.

Answer: D
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of redness, pain, and vision loss, along with the physical examination findings of shallow anterior chamber, corkscrew conjunctival vessels, and serous choroidal detachment, suggest a possible diagnosis of uveitis. The presence of an occludable angle on gonioscopy also supports this diagnosis. Uveitis is a condition characterized by inflammation in the uveal tract, which can cause a variety of symptoms and signs, including redness, pain, and vision loss. The patient's age and lack of any significant medical history also increase the likelihood of uveitis as the underlying cause of her symptoms.

Therefore, the next step in management would be to perform imaging studies to further evaluate the extent of the uveitis and any potential complications. Magnetic resonance imaging with magnetic resonance angiography or digital subtraction angiography (MRI/MRA or DSA) would be the most appropriate imaging modality to use in this case, as it can provide detailed information about the vasculature and any potential inflammation or abnormalities in the eye.

Ultrasound biomicroscopy (Option A) may also be useful in evaluating the anterior segment of the eye, but it may not provide as much information about the posterior segment and the vasculature as MRI/MRA or DSA. Uveitis workup and steroids (Option B) may be necessary in the management of uveitis, but they are not the next step in the diagnostic workup. Thyroid profile (Option C) is not relevant to the patient's symptoms or physical examination findings, and therefore would not be the next step in management.

Performing peripheral iridotomy (option A) or full-thickness sclerectomy (option B) may be necessary later, but they are not the most urgent interventions needed at this point. Combined phacoemulsification-vitrectomy surgery (option D) may also be considered, but it is not the most appropriate next step, as the patient's symptoms and examination findings do not indicate a need for immediate surgical intervention.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination findings, including bilateral panuveitis, diffuse pigmentary abnormalities, and retinal pigment epithelium loss, suggest a possibility of uveal leukemic infiltration. The negative results of repeat testing for Treponema pallidum, Lyme disease, and HIV, as well as the negative results of magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbit for leukemic infiltration, make it less likely that the patient's condition is caused by an infectious or inflammatory process. Immunomodulatory therapy with oral steroids (Option A) may not be effective in treating leukemic infiltration, and observation (Option D) may not be appropriate given the severity of the patient's symptoms and examination findings. Intravitreal steroid injection (Option C) may provide some benefit in reducing inflammation, but it is not likely to address the underlying cause of the patient's condition. Pars plana vitrectomy for vitreous biopsy with or without chorioretinal biopsy for flow cytometry to assess for leukemic cells (Option B) would allow for a definitive diagnosis of uveal leukemic infiltration and guide further management.

Answer: C
Explanation: Pleomorphic adenoma is a type of salivary gland tumor that can arise in the parapharyngeal space. The patient's symptoms of left jaw tightness, aural fullness, and facial discomfort are consistent with a PPS mass. The MRI findings of a well-circumscribed, ovoid mass that is hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging and demonstrates heterogeneous enhancement following gadolinium administration are also consistent with a pleomorphic adenoma. The patient's age and the location of the mass in the left prestyloid PPS also support this diagnosis.

A Schwannoma (Option A) is a benign tumor of the nerve sheath that can occur in the head and neck, but it is less likely to occur in the PPS. Venous malformation (Option B) is a congenital vascular anomaly that can occur in the head and neck, but it is not typically isointense on T1-weighted imaging and hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging. Paraganglioma (Option D) is a rare tumor that arises from the paraganglia and can occur in the head and neck, but it is less likely to occur in the PPS and typically demonstrates a different imaging pattern.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of left-sided facial weakness and swelling, along with the physical examination findings consistent with left lower-motor-neuron type of facial nerve palsy, suggest a neurological disorder affecting the left facial nerve. The MRI findings of mucosal thickening and bony destruction with foci of remodeling involving the walls of the maxillary sinuses, along with the enhancement of the facial nerve and its branches, are consistent with perineural extension of disease. The patient's history of recurrent high-grade serous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary and recent cycle of chemotherapy suggest a possible metastatic spread of the cancer to the maxillary sinus. The absence of any neuroparenchymal or meningeal lesions on MRI and the presence of diffuse enhancement and thickening of the extracranial left facial nerve proximal to the site of involvement suggest that the neurological symptoms are likely due to the perineural spread of the cancer. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is maxillary carcinoma with perineural spread, which is option A.

Answer: C
Explanation: The clinical presentation of a nodular lesion on the midline dorsal tongue, along with the histopathological findings of acellular, amorphous, and eosinophilic material arranged in lobules, is consistent with a diagnosis of median rhomboid glossitis (nodular variant). This condition is a rare benign inflammatory lesion that affects the tongue, characterized by a central nodular component and surrounding atrophic papillae. The patient's age and lack of symptoms also support this diagnosis.

The other options are less likely:

A: Fibroma is a benign tumor of connective tissue origin, but it typically presents as a slow-growing, painless mass, and the histopathological features do not match the description of median rhomboid glossitis.

B: Granular cell tumor is a rare benign neoplasm that can occur in various parts of the body, including the tongue. However, it typically presents as a painless, slow-growing mass, and the histopathological features of granular cell tumor are different from the ones described in the case.

D: Localized amyloidosis (amyloidoma) is a rare condition characterized by the accumulation of amyloid fibrils in a localized area. While it can affect various organs, including the tongue, the clinical and histopathological features do not match the presentation of median rhomboid glossitis.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of a diffuse cutaneous eruption with folliculocentric scaly papules and waxy, exfoliative scale on the palms and soles, as well as ectropion, suggests a diagnosis of psoriasis. The patient's history of no recent viral or bacterial infection, absence of fever, night sweats, fatigue, and recent unintentional weight loss, and lack of any new medications or supplements, supports this diagnosis. A skin biopsy with T-cell clonality studies would be appropriate to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.

Option A, ordering a myositis-specific autoantibody panel, would not be appropriate at this time, as the patient does not have any symptoms or signs suggestive of myositis.

Option C, ordering testing for anti–double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody, may be appropriate in the future if the patient's symptoms persist or worsen, as psoriasis can sometimes be associated with autoimmune disorders. However, it is not the most appropriate next step at this time.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's black tongue discoloration is likely a result of medication-related adverse effects, specifically due to the intravenous cefazolin therapy that was initiated for the subscapularis pyomyositis. Cefazolin is a cephalosporin antibiotic that has been associated with a rare but known side effect of black hairy tongue, also known as lingua nigra. This condition is caused by the deposition of pigmented material on the surface of the tongue, which can be seen as black or dark brown discoloration. The patient's lack of symptoms and history of no prior lingual discoloration, as well as the temporal association with the initiation of cefazolin therapy, support this diagnosis. Therefore, option C, providing reassurance and prescribing oral care, is the most appropriate next step in management. Option A, measuring serum cortisol level, is not relevant to the patient's current condition. Option B, performing a tongue biopsy, may be unnecessary and invasive, as the diagnosis of black hairy tongue is primarily clinical. Option D, stopping cefazolin, may be considered if the patient experiences persistent or severe symptoms, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this time.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and signs of bilateral blurry vision, eye redness, discharge, photophobia, and pain, along with the physical examination findings of chemosis, conjunctival hyperemia, microcystic corneal edema, and hypopyon, are concerning for endophthalmitis. Endophthalmitis is a sight-threatening infection that can occur after intraocular surgery or penetrating ocular trauma. The patient's recent history of voretigene neparvovec gene therapy and removal of a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) increases the likelihood of endophthalmitis. The presence of a hypopyon, which is a collection of inflammatory cells in the anterior chamber, is a hallmark sign of endophthalmitis.

Therefore, the next step would be to obtain a sample of the hypopyon through anterior chamber paracentesis and inject intravitreal antibiotics to treat the infection. This is the most appropriate answer among the options provided.

Option A, observing the patient without intervention, is not appropriate as endophthalmitis is a medical emergency that requires prompt treatment to prevent further vision loss.

Option B, performing pars plana vitrectomy, is not necessary at this point as there is no evidence of a vitreous infection or retinal detachment.

Option D, awaiting results from systemic laboratory tests and blood culture, may be necessary to rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, but it is not the most urgent step in managing the patient's condition.

Answer: C
Explanation:
The patient's history of esophageal atresia, small bowel obstruction, mild cognitive impairment, low tone, and increased reflexes, along with the presence of nystagmus since birth, suggests a possible neurological disorder. The absence of a family history of ocular disease and the normal pupillary responses further support this suspicion. The patient's brain MRI scan was previously reported as normal, but given the persistent nystagmus, it would be appropriate to review the scan and consider ordering additional tests such as an electroretinogram (ERG) to evaluate the retinal function and potentially identify any underlying neuro-ophthalmic disorders. Therefore, option C, "Order genetic workup," is the most appropriate next step in management.

Option A, "Review brain MRI and order electroretinogram," is also a reasonable choice, but it is not the most appropriate next step, as it does not take into account the patient's entire clinical presentation.

Option B, "Refer for strabismus surgery," is not appropriate at this time, as the patient's nystagmus is not due to strabismus.

Option D, "Treat with clonazepam," is not appropriate, as clonazepam is not used to treat nystagmus in children, and it may have unintended consequences, such as sedation and respiratory depression.

LCV is a rare condition characterized by inflammation and destruction of blood vessels, leading to the formation of ulcers and other skin lesions. The patient's history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and isolated deletion 5q (del5q) increases the likelihood of LCV. The presence of neutrophils and histiocytes in the skin lesions, as well as the negative results for herpes zoster virus and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, support the diagnosis of LCV. Additionally, the patient's use of lenalidomide, which has been associated with LCV in some cases, further supports this diagnosis. Pyoderma gangrenosum (option B) is a possible alternative diagnosis, but the absence of characteristic features such as a history of ulceration, pain, and swelling, as well as the lack of Neisseria aeruginosa colonization, makes it less likely. Leukemia cutis (option A) is unlikely given the absence of immature myeloid precursors in the skin lesions, and lymphomatoid papulosis (option D) is not supported by the patient's history or laboratory results.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's history of end-stage kidney disease, proteinuria since age 7, and Mycobacterium avium complex infection suggests that she may have a genetic disorder affecting her kidneys and eyes. The anomalous appearance of the optic discs, particularly the central excavation in the left eye, is consistent with a genetic disorder such as optic disc pit or coloboma. Therefore, genetic testing (option B) would be the most appropriate next step to determine the underlying cause of the patient's visual changes and optic disc abnormalities.

The other options do not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms:

* Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (option A) may show abnormalities related to the patient's kidney disease or other intracranial pathology, but it would not specifically diagnose a genetic disorder affecting the eyes.
* Vasculitis serological evaluation (option C) would be appropriate if the patient had symptoms or signs of active vasculitis, but there is no indication of this in the case description.
* Positron emission tomography (option D) is not likely to provide useful information in this case, as it is primarily used to image metabolic activity in the body and would not specifically diagnose a genetic disorder affecting the eyes.

Answer: C 
Explanation: The patient's history of multiple squamous cell carcinomas and the presence of a tender, enlarging scalp lesion with overlying vessels suggest a diagnosis of solitary fibrous tumor. The histopathologic findings of a dermal-based tumor with a vague nodular configuration, proliferation of tumor cells around small vessels, and scattered mitoses and necrosis are also consistent with this diagnosis. The positive staining for smooth muscle actin further supports this diagnosis. While symplastic glomus tumor and angioleiomyoma are also possible diagnoses, the absence of a purulent discharge and overlying skin changes suggests that the lesion is not infected, which is consistent with a diagnosis of solitary fibrous tumor. Malignant myopericytoma is a rare and aggressive tumor that typically affects the soft tissues of the extremities and is not typically associated with a history of multiple squamous cell carcinomas. Therefore, option C, solitary fibrous tumor, is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as the gradual growth of multiple infiltrated erythematous-violaceous patches and plaques with occasional slight pain, are consistent with acquired progressive lymphangioma. The irregular borders and absence of scaling are also consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the histopathological examination reveals irregularly branched, thin-walled blood vessels dissecting through collagen bundles within the superficial to mid dermis, which is a characteristic feature of lymphangioma. The positive staining of endothelial cells for CD31 further supports this diagnosis.

Therefore, option C, acquired progressive lymphangioma, is the correct answer.

Option A, patch-stage Kaposi sarcoma, is incorrect because although both conditions may present with similar skin lesions, Kaposi sarcoma typically affects the lower extremities and is more common in males.

Option B, interstitial granulomatous dermatitis, is also incorrect because although it may present with skin lesions, the histopathological examination reveals a different picture, with a granulomatous inflammation and no evidence of blood vessel proliferation.

Option D, microvenular hemangioma, is incorrect because although it may present with similar skin lesions, the histopathological examination reveals a different picture, with a proliferation of small blood vessels, which is not seen in this case.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and radiologic findings are consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which can be caused by various etiologies, including sepsis, pneumonia, and lung injury. In this case, the likely cause of ARDS is the osteal occlusion of the left main coronary artery, which led to cardiogenic shock and hypoperfusion of the lungs. The patient's history of anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction and reduced left ventricle systolic function also support this diagnosis.

The patient's treatment with amiodarone, which is an anti-arrhythmic drug, suggests that the clinicians were concerned about the patient's arrhythmias, but it is not the most appropriate treatment for ARDS.

Performing a lung biopsy (option A) may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of ARDS, but it is not the most urgent step in the patient's management. Discontinuing amiodarone and administering a corticosteroid (option B) may be appropriate if the patient's arrhythmias are caused by an inflammatory process, but it is not the most immediate intervention needed for the patient's respiratory distress. Performing bronchoalveolar lavage (option C) may be helpful in diagnosing and managing respiratory infections, but it is not the most appropriate step in the patient's management given the patient's history and clinical presentation. Checking amiodarone plasma level (option D) may be necessary to ensure that the patient is not experiencing adverse effects from the drug, but it is not the most urgent step in the patient's management.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in the patient's management would be to perform a lung biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of ARDS and guide further treatment.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of syncope and frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) suggest a potential arrhythmic cause. Nadolol, a beta-blocker, is the appropriate choice to treat the patient's symptoms. It will help to slow the heart rate, reduce the number of PVCs, and prevent the development of a more serious arrhythmia.

Option A, implanting a defibrillator, may be considered for patients with a high risk of sudden cardiac death, but it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient as there is no evidence of a life-threatening arrhythmia.

Option B, performing provocative drug testing with procainamide, may be considered to assess the patient's arrhythmic risk, but it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient as the symptoms and ECG findings are already suggestive of a significant arrhythmic disorder.

Option D, ablating PVCs, may be considered for patients with refractory symptoms despite medical therapy, but it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient as the symptoms are not severe and the patient has not failed medical therapy.

Answer: D
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest that she has developed a gallstone-related complication, such as a gallstone impaction or fistula, which may have led to a bowel obstruction. The patient's hypotension and tachycardia suggest that she is septic, which is consistent with the presence of a fistula. The patient's history of atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure also increases the risk of complications.

Given these findings, the most appropriate next step would be to plan for surgical intervention after intravenous fluid resuscitation in the intensive care unit (ICU). This will allow for further evaluation and management of the patient's condition, including the possibility of surgical repair or drainage of the fistula, and management of any related complications such as sepsis or bowel obstruction.

Administering barium through the nasogastric tube may be useful in evaluating for bowel obstruction, but it is not the most urgent step in the patient's management. Ordering magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography may provide additional information about the biliary tree, but it is not as urgent as addressing the patient's sepsis and potential bowel obstruction. Performing an emergency exploratory laparotomy may be necessary, but it should be done after the patient has received appropriate fluid resuscitation and stabilization in the ICU.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, and bloating, along with the physical examination findings of purpuric macules and thumbprint-like patches on the abdomen and chest, suggest a possible diagnosis of vasculitis. The patient's history of bullous pemphigoid and recent episode of dyspnea also support this diagnosis. ANCA (antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody) is often elevated in patients with vasculitis, so it would be appropriate to order an ANCA level to help confirm the diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's recent exposure to prednisolone, a steroid medication, may have contributed to the development of vasculitis. Therefore, option C is the best answer.

Given the patient's history of resistance to these medications, it may be reasonable to consider alternative treatments. Observation with systemic cidofovir and CMV immune globulin may be a reasonable next step, as it allows for continued management of the patient's CMV viremia while avoiding the potential side effects and resistance associated with continued intravitreal injections. Additionally, cidofovir has been shown to have some efficacy in treating CMV retinitis, and CMV immune globulin may provide additional benefit by neutralizing CMV antigens and reducing inflammation.

Explanation: The patient's history of a palpable left axillary mass, combined with the imaging findings of a high-density irregular mass in the left axilla and the biopsy diagnosis of high-grade adenocarcinoma with papillary features, suggests a primary breast cancer with axillary metastasis. The patient's history of long-term estradiol use and postmenopausal status increases the likelihood of a hormone-sensitive tumor. The positive immunostaining for PAX8, p53, and WT1 and negative staining for GATA3 supports the diagnosis of a high-grade breast carcinoma. The absence of any breast lesions on magnetic resonance imaging and the high uptake in the left axilla region on positron emission tomography/computed tomography also support the diagnosis of an occult primary breast cancer. Therefore, option C, high-grade carcinoma of the breast with occult primary, is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and test results indicate a cervical chondrocutaneous branchial remnant. A cervical chondrocutaneous branchial remnant is a rare congenital abnormality that happens when the branchial arches, which form the neck and throat during fetal development, do not properly disappear. The presence of cartilage in the subcutis, as shown by the histopathological analysis, supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the location of the mass on the anterior border of the lower third of the left sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM) is consistent with a cervical chondrocutaneous branchial remnant. The other options, such as a branchial cleft cyst, epidermoid cyst, or hair follicle nevus, do not align with the patient's symptoms and test results.

Answer: B 
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as a slow-growing, painless neck mass with no other masses, cervical lymphadenopathy, or systemic symptoms, and the imaging findings, such as a hypoechoic mass on ultrasound and a well-circumscribed mass of mainly soft tissue density with contrast enhancement on MRI, are consistent with an ossifying fibromyxoid tumor (OFMT). OFMTs are rare, benign soft tissue tumors that typically affect children and young adults. They are characterized by a fibromyxoid stroma with osteoclast-type giant cells and thin trabeculae of woven bone surfaced with osteoblasts, which are similar to the histopathological findings described in the case. Additionally, the positive USP6 locus rearrangement (17p13.2) on florescence in situ hybridization supports the diagnosis of OFMT. The other options, soft tissue giant cell tumor, soft tissue aneurysmal bone cyst, and soft tissue osteosarcoma, can also present with similar symptoms and imaging findings, but their histopathological features are distinct from those of OFMT. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is an ossifying fibromyxoid tumor.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's presentation of spontaneous blistering on the right lower extremity, hyperpigmented macules, and tense bullae on the anterior aspect of the right lower extremity, dorsal foot surface, and toes, is consistent with diabetic dermopathy. Diabetic dermopathy is a skin condition that occurs in patients with diabetes and is characterized by skin thickening, hyperpigmentation, and skin fragility, leading to spontaneous blistering. Performing a skin biopsy for histopathology and direct immunofluorescence would be the appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis of diabetic dermopathy. Aspirating the bullae with a sterile needle and covering with a clean dressing may provide temporary relief, but it would not address the underlying cause of the condition. Starting oral prednisone may be considered for the management of diabetic dermopathy, but it would not be the next step in the diagnostic workup. Treating with oral cephalexin for 7 days would not be appropriate, as there is no indication of a bacterial infection.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of sudden painless vision loss in one eye, along with ear pain and fullness, nasal congestion, and night sweats, suggest a possible diagnosis of giant cell arteritis (GCA). GCA is a vasculitis that affects the medium and large arteries, including the ophthalmic artery, which can cause vision loss. The cherry red spot and hyperreflectivity on optical coherence tomography (OCT) are also consistent with GCA. The patient's elevated inflammatory markers, such as white blood cell count, neutrophilia, and C-reactive protein, support this diagnosis. Therefore, the next step would be to request a magnetic resonance image (MRI) of the orbits and sinuses to further evaluate the extent of the vasculitis and identify any potential complications, such as stenosis or aneurysm. This would help guide further management and treatment decisions.

Explanation: The patient's history of metastatic breast cancer and the presence of scaly macules and papules on her forearms, face, chest, and upper back, which are typical locations for cutaneous metastases, suggest that the rash is likely due to cutaneous deposits of metastatic breast cancer. The fact that the rash did not respond to treatment with topical clindamycin, oral solumedrol, or doxycycline, which are commonly used to treat skin conditions such as actinic keratoses or medication hypersensitivity reactions, supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of substantial sun exposure increases the likelihood of cutaneous metastases. Therefore, option A is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C. Schwannoma.
Explanation: A Schwannoma, also known as a neurilemmoma, is a benign tumor that originates from the supporting cells of the nervous system called Schwann cells. The patient's symptoms of intermittent stridor, which worsened while sleeping and at rest, and the location of the mass in the distal cervical trachea, are consistent with a Schwannoma. The fact that the mass was pedunculated and emanated from the anterior wall of the cervical trachea, as seen in the intraoperative photographs, also supports this diagnosis. Chondroma (A) is a benign cartilaginous tumor that can occur in the trachea, but it is less likely given the patient's symptoms and the location of the mass. Glomus tumor (B) is a rare benign tumor that originates from the glomus cells of the trachea, but it typically presents with symptoms of bleeding, coughing, and hoarseness, which were not mentioned in the case. Granular cell tumor (D) is a rare benign tumor that can occur in various parts of the body, including the trachea, but it is not typically associated with the patient's symptoms or the location of the mass.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and imaging results are consistent with Gorham-Stout disease, a rare condition characterized by the proliferation of lymphatic vessels in the bone. The patient's unilateral hearing loss and middle ear effusion suggest a possible CSF leak, which was confirmed by the presence of β-2-transferrine in the middle ear fluid. The lytic aspect of the right temporal bone extending to the petrous apex and the petrous bone, sparing the otic capsule, is consistent with Gorham-Stout disease. The hyperintense T2 signal in the petrous apex and mastoid air cells, as well as the suspected communication into the soft tissues of the right neck, are also consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's imaging results and clinical presentation support the diagnosis of Gorham-Stout disease over the other options. Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a condition that can cause bone lesions, but it typically affects the skull and long bones, and is not associated with CSF leaks. Cholesteatoma is a condition that can cause middle ear effusion, but it is not associated with bone lesions or CSF leaks. Sarcoma is a type of cancer that can affect the temporal bone, but it typically presents with pain, swelling, and facial weakness or paralysis, and is not associated with CSF leaks.

Hydroxyurea is known to cause cutaneous side effects, including ulcerations, particularly in patients with a history of skin cancer. The patient's history of nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSCa) and the absence of other constitutional symptoms also support this diagnosis. The histopathologic findings (hematoxylin-eosin stain) shown in Figure D are consistent with hydroxyurea-induced ulcerations. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including multiple hard nodules on the scalp and subcutaneous nodules on the hands, feet, trunk, and lower extremities, are consistent with lipoid proteinosis. This condition is characterized by the accumulation of a homogeneous eosinophilic hyaline matrix, which is supported by the histopathological findings described in the case (large amounts of homogeneous eosinophilic hyaline matrix with scattered fibroblasts). Additionally, the patient's history of recurring tumors and lack of tenderness or swelling are also consistent with lipoid proteinosis.

Infantile myofibromatosis (option A) typically presents with multiple subcutaneous masses in the first year of life, and the patient's age at onset (5 years old) and the gradual increase in size and number of tumors over time do not fit this diagnosis.

Mafucci syndrome (option B) is a rare condition characterized by multiple non-pigmented skin nodules and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). The patient's consanguineous parents and lack of other family members with the disease do not support this diagnosis.

Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis (option D) is a rare benign tumor that typically affects children and young adults. The patient's age at onset and the histopathological findings do not support this diagnosis.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient has developed torsade de pointes (TdP), a potentially life-threatening arrhythmia, while receiving metoprolol succinate. TdP is a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation, and is associated with a high risk of sudden death. The presence of alternans in T-wave polarity and amplitude in the electrocardiogram (ECG) suggests that the patient has a prolonged QTc interval, which is a known risk factor for TdP.

Given the severity of the patient's condition, the most appropriate next step would be to start intravenous amiodarone, which is a class III antiarrhythmic drug that is effective in converting TdP to a stable rhythm. Amiodarone has a rapid onset of action and can be administered intravenously, making it the best choice for emergency situations like this.

Discontinuing metoprolol (answer A) may not be sufficient to address the underlying arrhythmia, and starting sotalol (answer A) may not be appropriate given the patient's history of TdP. Starting intravenous magnesium (answer C) may be considered, but it may not be as effective as amiodarone in converting TdP to a stable rhythm. Emergent implantable cardioverter defibrillator implant (answer D) may be considered in certain cases, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this scenario.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's sudden onset of dyspnea and retrosternal chest pain during balloon mitral valvotomy suggests a potential embolic event. Catheter-directed thromboembolectomy (option C) would be the most appropriate next step, as it allows for the removal of any potential emboli that may have formed during the procedure. This procedure involves using a catheter to remove the emboli from the pulmonary artery or other vessels. The other options do not address the potential embolic event and may not improve the patient's symptoms. Pericardiocentesis (option A) is a procedure that involves draining fluid from the pericardial sac surrounding the heart and may not be necessary in this case. Intravenous thrombolysis (option B) is a treatment for deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism, but it may not be effective in this case as the emboli may be located in the pulmonary artery and not in the veins.

Obtaining aqueous fluid for fungal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) would be the next step in the management of this patient, as it would help to confirm the diagnosis and guide further treatment.

Increasing the frequency of topical corticosteroids (Option A) may help to reduce inflammation, but it would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Referring the patient to an ocular oncologist (Option B) may be appropriate if the lesions are suspected to be melanoma, but there is no indication of this in the patient's history or examination findings.

Angiosarcoma is a rare but known complication of MF, and the patient's symptoms of recurrent hemorrhagic and friable nodules on the hips and forearms are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's previous exposure to radiation therapy and immunosuppressive therapy following HSCT may have increased his risk of developing angiosarcoma. The patient's history of chronic GVHD and the presence of granulation tissue on histology also support this diagnosis.

Answer: C: IgG4-related disease
Explanation: IgG4-related disease is a systemic condition characterized by the infiltration of various organs by IgG4-positive plasma cells, leading to fibrosis, inflammation, and tissue damage. The patient's symptoms of orbital swelling, eye pain, and blurry vision, as well as the bilateral proptosis and sinusitis, are consistent with IgG4-related disease. The patient's family history, with a brother and father who both had chronic orbital swelling, suggests a possible genetic component. The patient's elevated IgG4 levels and normal white blood cell count, thyroid-stimulating hormone, angiotensin-converting enzyme, lysozyme, antinuclear antibody, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) levels, are also consistent with IgG4-related disease. The patient's history of hypertension, poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, tobacco use, and asthma may also be relevant to the patient's overall health and potential treatment plan, but they are not directly related to the likely diagnosis of IgG4-related disease.

The other options are less likely:
A: Graves disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes hyperthyroidism, and is not associated with IgG4-related disease.
B: Invasive fungal sinusitis with orbital extension is a possibility, given the patient's symptoms and the findings on imaging, but the patient's history and laboratory results do not support this diagnosis.
D: Sarcoidosis is a systemic inflammatory disease that can affect various organs, including the eyes, but it is not associated with IgG4-related disease.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of redness, swelling, and discharge from the tumor site, as well as the absence of leukocytosis and negative wound cultures, suggest that the tumor is responding to the neoadjuvant immunotherapy. The formation of a white head and spontaneous drainage of cloudy discharge are consistent with immunotherapy-related inflammation, which can cause the tumor to become inflamed and produce fluid. The patient's lack of pain and fever also support this diagnosis. Infection and suppuration (option A) would typically present with more severe symptoms, such as pain, swelling, and redness, and would likely require antibiotic treatment.

The patient's symptoms of a painful bruise on her hand that has persisted for 2 years, along with the physical examination findings of an ill-defined indurated blue-green plaque on the dorsum of the hand, are consistent with the diagnosis of Pigmented dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (Bednar tumor). This type of tumor is a rare soft tissue sarcoma that typically presents as a slowly growing mass with a characteristic blue-green discoloration of the overlying skin. The patient's age and lack of personal or family history of bleeding disorders also support this diagnosis.

The other options are less likely:

A, Pigmented epithelioid melanocytoma, is a rare type of melanoma that typically presents as a pigmented lesion on sun-exposed skin. It is unlikely in this case because the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest a pigmented lesion.

B, Hemosiderotic fibrolipomatous tumor, is a rare benign tumor that typically presents as a slowly growing mass in the soft tissues of the extremities. It is unlikely in this case because the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest a benign tumor, and the patient's age is not consistent with the typical age range for this diagnosis.

D, Angiomatoid fibrous histiocytoma, is a rare soft tissue tumor that typically presents as a slowly growing mass in the soft tissues of the extremities. It is unlikely in this case because the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest a vascular tumor, and the patient's age is not consistent with the typical age range for this diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with eosinophilic, polymorphic, and pruritic eruption associated with radiotherapy (EPPER). EPPER is a rare but recognized side effect of radiotherapy, characterized by a pruritic, polymorphic rash with eosinophilic infiltration. The patient's history of recent postoperative radiotherapy and the presence of eosinophilia on her complete blood cell count support this diagnosis. Additionally, the histopathological examination of the punch biopsy showed a moderately dense perivascular and interstitial infiltrate of mononuclear cells with innumerable eosinophils, which is consistent with EPPER.

The other options do not fit the patient's presentation. Radiation-induced bullous pemphigoid (option A) is a rare side effect of radiotherapy that presents with large, tense blisters and is associated with positive direct and indirect immunofluorescence tests for IgG and C3. Urticarial vasculitis (option B) is a condition characterized by inflammation of the blood vessels, leading to the formation of urticarial lesions, and is often associated with systemic symptoms such as fever, joint pain, and abdominal pain. Urticaria multiforme (option D) is a condition characterized by the development of multiple urticarial lesions, but it does not have the same level of eosinophilic infiltration as EPPER.

Answer: A: Discharge home after implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator
Explanation: The patient has been stabilized and has undergone cardiac catheterization, which revealed patent coronary arteries. The patient also had a dilated right ventricle with moderately reduced systolic function and transmural late gadolinium enhancement with akinesis and dyskinesis involving the right ventricular (RV) free wall and outflow tract extending to the left ventricular (LV) anterior, septal, and apical segments. Given these findings, it is likely that the patient has a cardiomyopathy, which is a condition that can lead to arrhythmias. In this case, the patient has already had a wide complex tachycardia and nonsustained ventricular tachycardia, which suggests that they are at high risk for sudden cardiac death. An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is a device that can detect and terminate life-threatening arrhythmias, and it would be appropriate to discharge the patient home with an ICD after implantation.

Therefore, option A is the correct answer.

Option B, cardiac positron emission tomography, may be useful in certain cases to assess myocardial perfusion and metabolism, but it is not necessary in this case given the patient's stable condition and the availability of other diagnostic tests.

Option C, transthoracic echocardiogram, may provide additional information about the patient's cardiac function and structure, but it is not necessary at this time given the patient's stable condition and the availability of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, which has already been performed.

Option D, electrophysiology study, may be useful in certain cases to assess the electrical activity of the heart and identify potential arrhythmogenic sites, but it is not necessary in this case given the patient's stable condition and the availability of other diagnostic tests.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of severe neck pain, accompanied by swelling and persistent dull pain of the upper anterior chest wall, followed by an electric shock-like numbness on the ipsilateral side of the tongue, are consistent with a diagnosis of Rickettsial infection. The presence of pustules on both hands and the negative results of workup for rheumatic and infectious disease, including antinuclear, antineutrophil cytoplasmic, and anticardiolipin antibodies, human leukocyte antigen B27, repeated blood cultures, rapid plasma reagin test, Aspergillus galactomannan antigen, brucella, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and rickettsial antibodies, support this diagnosis. Additionally, the abnormal enhancement of C1/C2 vertebrae with prevertebral and retrodental tissue as well as of the anterior vertebrae at C4/C5 with hyperostotic anterior osteophytes on MRI, and the multiple pustules on the palm, are also consistent with Rickettsial infection. Therefore, option C, Rickettsial infection, is the correct answer.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with oropharyngeal candidiasis, also known as thrush. This is a common opportunistic infection caused by the fungus Candida, which can affect the mouth and throat. The patient's history of recent antibiotic use and lack of significant medical history suggest that this is likely a case of acute oropharyngeal candidiasis. Performing a biopsy of the gray-white plaque (option B) would be the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis. This would involve removing a small sample of tissue from the affected area and examining it under a microscope for signs of fungal infection.

Option A, obtaining serologic test results for Treponema pallidum, may be necessary if the patient had a history of genital ulcers or other symptoms suggestive of syphilis, but it is not the most appropriate next step given the patient's current symptoms and history.

Option C, prescribing oral amoxicillin, may be effective in treating bacterial infections, but it would not be effective against a fungal infection such as oropharyngeal candidiasis.

Option D, starting topical nystatin, may be a reasonable treatment option for oropharyngeal candidiasis, but it would not be the most appropriate next step without first confirming the diagnosis through a biopsy.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and clinical findings, including intermittent dull pain, blurred vision, and an amelanotic choroidal lesion with associated subretinal fluid and hyperpigmentation, are concerning for a choroidal melanoma. The presence of a second, subtle amelanotic elevated lesion under the fovea also raises concern for a potential second melanoma or a metastasis. Given the patient's history of keratoconus and the presence of a choroidal lesion, a positron emission tomography (PET) scan would be the most appropriate next step in the patient's management. A PET scan can help to determine the extent of the lesion and identify any potential metastases, which would guide further management and treatment decisions. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (Option A) may not provide sufficient tissue for diagnosis and may risk seeding the tumor. Rituximab and radiotherapy (Option B) are not appropriate for the management of choroidal melanoma. Plaque brachytherapy (Option D) is a treatment option for choroidal melanoma, but it would not be appropriate at this stage of the patient's management without further diagnostic testing.

Answer: A
Explanation: Fine-needle aspiration biopsy with cytology and cytogenetics is the appropriate next step in the management of this patient's ocular tumor. The patient has a history of breast and kidney carcinomas, and the presence of an amelanotic choroidal mass in her left eye raises the suspicion of metastatic disease. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy can help establish the diagnosis by obtaining a tissue sample for cytological and cytogenetic analysis. This is the most appropriate and least invasive method for diagnosing uveal tumors.

The other options are not appropriate for the following reasons:

B: Iodine 125 plaque radiotherapy is a treatment option for uveal melanoma, but it is not appropriate for diagnosing the tumor.

C: Initiating intravitreal methotrexate is not appropriate for diagnosing the tumor, and it is mainly used for treating uveitis and retinal vascular diseases.

D: Observing the patient with no additional testing or intervention is not appropriate given the patient's history of cancer and the presence of a suspicious ocular lesion. It is important to establish a definitive diagnosis to guide further management.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and test results point to inflammatory breast cancer. The patient's rash and swelling on the left side of the chest wall are consistent with the red, swollen, and warm skin that is typical of inflammatory breast cancer. Additionally, the biopsy results show atypical cells in the dermis that stain positive for CK-7, GATA-3, and PAX-8, which are markers commonly expressed in breast cancer. The patient's history of gynecomastia and inverted nipple also support this diagnosis. Finally, the positron emission tomography–computed tomography scan shows a diffuse, infiltrating FDG-avid cutaneous lesion on the left chest wall and multiple FDG-avid nodes in the axilla, left internal mammary, and left cervical chain, which is consistent with the spread of cancer cells in inflammatory breast cancer. The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and test results.

Answer: C 
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, as well as the imaging results, are consistent with familial lipomatosis, which is a rare inherited condition characterized by multiple benign lipomas. The patient's history of a similar mass that was treated with liposuction 10 years prior, and the absence of any neurological deficits, also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's family history is negative for any head and neck benign or malignant disease, which makes it less likely that the mass is a liposarcoma. Madelung disease is a rare condition that causes multiple lipomas to develop in the neck and throat, but it is usually associated with other symptoms such as difficulty swallowing, voice changes, and breathing problems, which are not mentioned in the case. Drug-induced lipomatosis is a rare side effect of certain medications, but the patient's social history is negative for tobacco or alcohol use, and there is no mention of any medications that could cause this condition. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is familial lipomatosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The given clinical case describes a patient with numerous, generalized, linear hyperkeratotic papules with central white spicules and comedo-like plugs. The patient has alopecia of the scalp and eyebrows, and the lesions are distributed along Blaschko lines. The skin biopsy shows hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and parakeratotic columns overlying dilated epidermal invaginations, as well as thinner granular layers and dilated eccrine ostia and acrosyringia under the parakeratotic columns. These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus (Option C).

The other options do not fit the clinical presentation and histopathological findings:

Option A, inflammatory linear verrucous epidermal nevus, is characterized by inflammatory changes and a verrucous appearance, which is not seen in this case.

Option B, trichodysplasia spinulosa, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by spinous and follicular hamartomas, which are not present in this case.

Option D, multiple minute digitate hyperkeratosis, is a condition characterized by numerous small, digitate papules on the palms and soles, which is not consistent with the linear distribution of lesions on the patient's trunk and extremities.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including nonhealing genital ulcers, scalp scaling, and lymphadenopathy, are consistent with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). The histopathological findings of atypical cells with grooved vesicular nuclei and positive immunohistochemistry for CD1a in the lower epidermis and dermis also support this diagnosis. LCH is a rare disease that can affect various organs, including the skin, lymph nodes, and liver. The patient's history of polyuria and polydipsia for the past 4 years suggests that the disease may have been present for some time. Behcet disease, metastatic Crohn disease, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and histopathological findings.

Answer: B 
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of recurrent presyncope and bradycardia, along with the presence of RBBB and LPFB on the ECG, suggest a possible conduction disorder. The patient's history of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction and coronary artery bypass graft also increase the likelihood of a conduction disorder. Pacemaker implantation would help regulate the patient's heart rhythm and alleviate symptoms. Ambulatory ECG monitoring (Option A) may also be considered to further evaluate the patient's arrhythmia, but given the patient's symptoms and ECG findings, pacemaker implantation is a more appropriate next step. An exercise treadmill test (Option C) may also be considered to evaluate the patient's exercise tolerance and identify any ischemic changes, but it is not the most appropriate next step given the patient's symptoms and ECG findings. Electrophysiology study (Option D) may be considered if the patient's arrhythmia persists after pacemaker implantation or if there are concerns about the patient's arrhythmia mechanism, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this time.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive camptocormia, head drop, and dysphagia, along with the presence of muscle atrophy and a small IgG κ paraprotein, are consistent with a diagnosis of paraneoplastic myositis. This is a rare condition where the immune system attacks the muscles, often in association with cancer. The patient's history of thyroid cancer and chronic left accessory nerve injury may also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's muscle biopsy showed atrophic myofibers with a patchy granular appearance, which is consistent with paraneoplastic myositis.

Late-onset Pompe disease (glycogen-storage disease type 2) (A) is unlikely as the patient does not have the characteristic respiratory or cardiac symptoms, and the muscle biopsy did not show the typical glycogen accumulation. Myasthenia gravis (B) is also unlikely as the patient does not have any symptoms of muscle weakness that worsen with activity or improve with rest, and there is no evidence of postsynaptic neuromuscular blockade on electromyography. Sporadic late-onset nemaline rod myopathy (D) is a rare condition that can cause muscle weakness and atrophy, but it typically affects the limb muscles more than the trunk muscles, and there is no evidence of the characteristic nemaline rods on muscle biopsy.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of loud snoring, infrequent abrupt awakenings with a sensation of breathlessness, and fatigue are consistent with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). The home sleep test results show a high apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 32.5 events per hour, indicating severe OSA. The patient's history of hypertension and epilepsy also suggests that she may be at risk for cardiovascular complications related to OSA. Given the severity of the patient's OSA and the presence of comorbidities, it would be appropriate to advise the use of a wedge pillow to avoid sleeping in the supine position, which can exacerbate OSA. This would be a reasonable first step in managing the patient's OSA, prior to considering other treatments such as continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy or laboratory-based polysomnography.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of severe physical exhaustion, syncopal episodes, dysphagia, and sinus congestion suggest a systemic illness that may be contributing to the elevated IOP in the left eye. The presence of mild chemosis and hyperemia in both eyes also suggests a possible inflammatory component. Given the history of remote cataract surgery and vitrectomy with membrane peel in both eyes, it is possible that the patient has developed a chronic inflammatory condition that is affecting the left eye.

Adding netarsudil eye drops every night at bedtime in the left eye (option C) may help to reduce the IOP and address any inflammation that may be contributing to the elevated pressure. This option is a reasonable next step in management, as it is a targeted therapy that specifically addresses the patient's IOP and inflammation.

Discontinuing fluorometholone eye drops (option A) may not address the underlying cause of the elevated IOP and may not improve the patient's symptoms. Performing a systemic workup, including chest imaging (option B), may be necessary to rule out any systemic conditions that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms, but it is not a direct solution to the patient's elevated IOP. Placing a second nonvalved tube in the left eye with adjuvant micropulse laser (option D) may be an appropriate option if the patient's IOP remains elevated despite medical therapy, but it is a more invasive procedure that may not be necessary at this time.

Answer: D
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of acute unilateral proptosis, binocular diplopia, and right periorbital pain and swelling, along with the MRI findings of an intraconal mass, suggest a possible orbital cellulitis or abscess. The presence of a well-circumscribed and homogenous lesion with low internal reflectivity on B-scan ultrasonography also supports this diagnosis. Orbital cellulitis or abscess is a surgical emergency that requires prompt treatment to prevent further complications such as vision loss, globe rupture, or meningitis. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to perform an emergency orbital exploration with lesion biopsy, which would allow for a definitive diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Admitting the patient to the hospital for a course of intravenous antibiotics (option A) may be necessary, but it would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Ordering a homovanillic acid and vanillylmandelic acid test (option B) may be helpful in diagnosing a possible neuroblastoma, but it is not the most urgent step in managing the patient's condition. Starting high-dose steroids (option C) may be beneficial in reducing inflammation, but it would not treat the underlying infection or abscess.

Additionally, the patient's history of nasal obstruction and progressive dysphonia, as well as the findings of yellow submucosal masses in the left nasal cavity, left laryngeal ventricle, and right trachea, are also consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's normal laboratory test results, including negative results for CD1a, support this diagnosis. Rosai-Dorfman disease, Castleman disease, and sarcoidosis are less likely diagnoses given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of painful lesions on the tongue that worsen with spicy foods, along with the physical examination findings of bilateral raised leukoplakia on the tongue and a slightly hairy appearance, are consistent with secondary syphilis. The patient's history of engaging in oral and anal intercourse also increases the likelihood of a sexually transmitted infection. The biopsy results showing dense perivascular plasmacytic infiltration and neutrophilic inflammation also support this diagnosis. Oral hairy leukoplakia (option A) is a condition characterized by hair-like projections on the tongue, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms or physical examination findings. Multifocal squamous cell carcinoma in situ (option B) is a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's age and lack of other risk factors. Herpetic infection (option D) could also be a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of bilateral blurry vision, large blue paracentral scotomata, and migraine without a scintillating scotoma, along with the physical examination findings of subtle reddish geographic irregularities at the level of the retinal pigment epithelial at a nasal juxtafoveal location in both eyes, suggest a possible diagnosis of retinal pigment epithelial abnormalities. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging technique that can provide high-resolution cross-sectional images of the retina and would be the most appropriate test to further evaluate the retinal pigment epithelial layer and any potential abnormalities. Genetic testing (Option A) may also be considered, but it would not provide the same level of detail as OCT in evaluating the retinal pigment epithelial layer. Electroretinogram (Option B) is a test that measures the electrical activity of the retina and would not be helpful in evaluating the retinal pigment epithelial layer. Fluorescein angiography (Option D) is an invasive test that involves injecting a dye into the bloodstream to evaluate the retinal circulation and would not be necessary at this stage of the evaluation.

Answer: B
Explanation: Loose anagen syndrome is a rare condition characterized by the loss of hair in the anagen phase, which is the active growth phase of hair follicles. It is often associated with a positive hair pull test, which is seen in this case. The patient's history of hair loss starting at the age of 1 year and the absence of any other skin or systemic abnormalities also support this diagnosis. The patient's normal intellectual performance and lack of developmental delay further suggest that the condition is not related to a neurological disorder. The patient's short hair and sparse hair over the scalp, as well as the mild lymphocytic perifollicular infiltrate and decreased anagen-to-telogen ratio seen on biopsy, are also consistent with loose anagen syndrome.

In contrast, short anagen syndrome is a condition where the hair follicles have a short anagen phase, leading to short hair that is easily pulled out. Trichodental dysplasia is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of hair, teeth, and nails. Hypotrichosis simplex of the scalp is a condition where there is a decrease in the number of hair follicles on the scalp, leading to thinning or absence of hair. None of these conditions seem to fit the patient's presentation as well as loose anagen syndrome.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's presentation of intensively pruritic annular papules on her extremities, with no involvement of the palms, soles, or oral mucosa, is consistent with the diagnosis of eruptive pruritic papular porokeratosis (EPP). EPP is a rare variant of porokeratosis, characterized by the rapid development of numerous small, itchy papules on the extremities. The patient's history of eczema and previous treatment with topical steroids and oral compound glycyrrhizin tablets, which had no effect, also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the absence of any remarkable medical or family history and the normal laboratory test results, including the absence of antinuclear antibodies, further support the diagnosis of EPP.

Annular lichen planus (option A) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by the development of distinctive annular lesions, typically on sun-exposed areas. While the patient's lesions are annular, they are not typical of annular lichen planus, as they are not scaly and do not have the characteristic Wickham's striae.

Perforating granuloma annulare (option B) is a rare condition characterized by the development of small, grouped papules with a central crust or ulceration. While the patient's lesions are annular and have a similar appearance to perforating granuloma annulare, the absence of any crust or ulceration and the lack of involvement of the palms, soles, or oral mucosa make this diagnosis less likely.

Atypical pityriasis rosea (option D) is a rare variant of pityriasis rosea, characterized by the development of small, scaly papules on the trunk and extremities. While the patient's lesions are papular, they are not scaly and do not have the characteristic "christmas tree" appearance of pityriasis rosea. Additionally, the absence of any notable medical history and the normal laboratory test results make this diagnosis less likely.

Answer: C
Explanation: This answer is correct because it addresses all modifiable cardiovascular risk factors and initiates cascade screening and high-intensity statin therapy and aspirin, 81 mg, daily. Given the patient's strong family history of premature ASCVD, it is important to address all modifiable risk factors and initiate cascade screening to identify first-degree relatives with elevated Lp(a). High-intensity statin therapy and aspirin, 81 mg, daily, are appropriate interventions to reduce the patient's 10-year ASCVD risk, which was estimated to be 1.6% based on the pooled cohort equations (PCEs). However, the patient's elevated Lp(a) level and family history of premature ASCVD suggest that further interventions may be necessary to reduce his risk. PCSK9 inhibitor therapy, such as evolocumab or alirocumab, may be considered to lower Lp(a) level, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management. Therefore, option C is the best answer.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive cerebellar ataxia, gaze-evoked horizontal nystagmus, slow saccades, and absence of stretch reflexes are consistent with Niemann-Pick disease type C (NPC). NPC is a rare genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme acid sphingomyelinase, leading to the accumulation of sphingomyelin in cells, particularly in the brain. The cerebellar atrophy and T2 hyperintensities in the middle cerebellar peduncles, cerebellar white matter, pons, and thalamus observed on MRI are also consistent with NPC. The patient's age of onset and duration of symptoms are also consistent with NPC, as the disease typically presents in childhood or adolescence and progresses slowly over time.

Friedreich ataxia (option A) is a rare genetic disorder caused by an expansion of a GAA repeat in the frataxin gene, leading to a deficiency of frataxin. It is characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, pyramidal signs, and peripheral neuropathy. However, the patient's symptoms and MRI findings do not support this diagnosis.

Fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (option B) is a rare genetic disorder caused by an expansion of a CGG repeat in the FMR1 gene. It is characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, tremors, and cognitive decline. However, the patient's symptoms and MRI findings do not support this diagnosis.

Mitochondrial ataxia (option D) is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA. It is characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, myoclonus, and seizures. However, the patient's symptoms and MRI findings do not support this diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of abdominal cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome (ACNES), also known as chronic regional pain syndrome (CRPS) type III. ACNES is a chronic pain condition characterized by localized pain and tenderness in the abdominal wall, often triggered by minor trauma or injury. The patient's history of intermittent abdominal pain episodes and the presence of a localized area of tenderness and hypoesthesia are consistent with this diagnosis.

Injecting a local anesthetic into the area of maximal tenderness is a diagnostic and therapeutic approach for ACNES. It can help to confirm the diagnosis by temporarily relieving the pain and tenderness in the affected area. Additionally, it can provide temporary relief from the chronic pain and discomfort associated with ACNES.

Gabapentin (option A) is not the most appropriate choice for this patient's condition, as it is primarily used for the treatment of seizures, neuropathic pain, and anxiety disorders. While it may be considered for the management of chronic pain in some cases, it is not the most effective medication for ACNES.

Assessing celiac artery flow (option B) is not relevant to the patient's symptoms or diagnosis.

Measuring urine porphobilinogen level (option D) is also not relevant to the patient's symptoms or diagnosis, as porphobilinogen is a metabolite of heme biosynthesis and is not related to ACNES.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including fever, cough, mucositis, and vesiculobullous skin lesions, are consistent with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. The presence of bilateral lower lobe infiltrates on the chest computed tomography scan also supports this diagnosis. Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM and IgG levels should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis. A pathergy test for Behçet disease (option A) may also be considered, as Behçet disease can present with similar symptoms, but the patient's age and absence of oral ulcers suggest Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection as a more likely diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient has presented with symptoms of peritonitis, and cloudy dialysis fluid. The appropriate step would be to await the results of the peritoneal dialysis fluid culture before starting intraperitoneal antibiotics. This will help identify the causative organism and guide targeted antibiotic therapy. Administering empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics without knowing the cause of the infection may not be effective and may contribute to antibiotic resistance. Sending blood cultures may not be helpful in this case as the infection is likely to be localized to the peritoneum.

Answer: D
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of odynophagia, dysphagia, shortness of breath, stridor, and bilateral vocal fold paralysis, as well as the findings of a prominent posterior pharyngeal wall, subtle asymmetry of vocal fold motion, and pooling of secretions in the left pyriform, are consistent with delayed iatrogenic bilateral vocal fold paralysis. The patient's history of anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgery, followed by a gradual onset of respiratory symptoms, suggests that the paralysis may have been caused by damage to the recurrent laryngeal nerves during the surgery. The absence of any other underlying neurological causes, such as Arnold-Chiari malformation or spinal abscess, and the resolution of symptoms following removal of the anterior cervical spinal plate, support this diagnosis. Therefore, option D is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: B
Explanation: Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is the next step in the management of this patient's pigmented iris lesion. The patient's history of a stable mass over several decades, lack of symptoms, and unremarkable slitlamp examination suggest a low likelihood of malignancy. However, the presence of mammillations and pigment granules on the surface of the tumor, as well as the homogeneous echogenicity of the tumor on ultrasound biomicroscopy, warrant further evaluation to rule out a melanocytic tumor. FNAB is a minimally invasive procedure that can provide cytological confirmation of the diagnosis and guide further management. Observation (Option A) may be appropriate for small, stable iris lesions, but in this case, the patient's age and the presence of mammillations suggest a higher likelihood of malignancy, making FNAB a more appropriate next step. Plaque brachytherapy (Option C) is typically used for larger, more posterior iris melanomas, and iridectomy (Option D) may be considered for larger lesions that are causing significant visual disturbances or are suspected to be malignant. However, in this case, FNAB is the most appropriate next step to determine the nature of the lesion before considering further interventions.

Answer: C
Explanation: The clinical presentation of multiple yellowish to erythematous papules and verrucous cobblestone-like plaques on the mucosal surface of the tongue, with no associated lesions on the skin of the face, neck, arms, or other sun-exposed areas, is consistent with nodular amyloidosis. The absence of symptoms and the gradual development of the lesions over a period of 3 months also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the histopathological findings of circumscribed eosinophilic, amorphous fissured masses in the subepithelial connective tissue (hematoxylin-eosin) are consistent with nodular amyloidosis. Nodular amyloidosis is a rare condition that typically affects the oral cavity, and it is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid deposits in the subepithelial connective tissue. The other options, verrucous xanthoma, colloid milium–classic adult type, and nodular colloid degeneration, may also present with similar clinical features, but they are less likely given the patient's history and the histopathological findings. Therefore, option C, nodular amyloidosis, is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation:
The clinical presentation and histopathological findings described in the case are consistent with cutaneous protothecosis. Protothecosis is a rare, chronic, and progressive fungal infection caused by Prototheca wickerhamii. It typically affects the skin and subcutaneous tissues, causing indurated plaques, ulcers, and nodules. The lesions often have a characteristic "salt and pepper" appearance due to the presence of numerous small, dark-staining fungal structures (protothecae) in the dermis.

The patient's history of a gradually increasing rash on the left forearm, with the development of ulcers on the dorsal aspect of his hand, is consistent with the typical clinical presentation of cutaneous protothecosis. The histopathological findings, including hyperkeratosis, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, and a lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with neutrophils, plasma cells, and multinucleated giant cells in the dermis, are also consistent with protothecosis. The presence of periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) positive fungal structures in the dermis further supports the diagnosis.

Chromoblastomycosis (option A) is a chronic fungal infection caused by Fonsecaea pedrosoi, which typically affects the skin and subcutaneous tissues. However, the clinical presentation and histopathological findings in this case are not consistent with chromoblastomycosis.

Cutaneous cryptococcosis (option B) is a rare infection caused by Cryptococcus neoformans, which typically affects the skin and subcutaneous tissues. However, the clinical presentation and histopathological findings in this case are not consistent with cutaneous cryptococcosis.

Cutaneous leishmaniasis (option D) is a parasitic infection caused by Leishmania spp., which typically affects the skin and subcutaneous tissues. However, the clinical presentation and histopathological findings in this case are not consistent with cutaneous leishmaniasis.

Answer: C: Perform coronary angiography
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of intermittent chest pain and diaphoresis, along with his history of smoking and elevated troponin T levels, suggest a high likelihood of coronary artery disease. The biphasic T waves in leads V2 and V3 on the initial electrocardiogram also support this diagnosis. While outpatient cardiology follow-up (option A) may be appropriate for some patients with chest pain, the patient's history of two recent episodes of chest pain and his elevated troponin T levels indicate a higher risk of cardiac events, making coronary angiography (option C) the most appropriate next step. A dobutamine stress echocardiogram (option B) may also be useful in evaluating the patient's cardiac function, but it would not provide the same level of diagnostic information as coronary angiography. Reordering troponin T measurement in 3 hours (option D) may be unnecessary and would not provide any additional information that would change management at this point.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient has experienced recurrent retrobulbar hemorrhages, and the MRI scan shows an intraorbital lesion. It is crucial to determine the cause of the hemorrhages and the nature of the lesion to provide appropriate treatment and prevent further complications. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography and positron emission tomography scan, can help to better characterize the lesion and identify any potential vascular malformations or other causes of the hemorrhages. Therefore, option C is the most appropriate answer.

Option A, clinical follow-up, may not provide sufficient information to determine the cause of the hemorrhages and may lead to a delay in appropriate treatment.

Option B, transconjunctival orbital biopsy, may be invasive and carry risks, such as globe perforation or bleeding, without providing sufficient information to guide management.

Option D, arteriography, may be useful in identifying orbital vascular malformations, but it may not provide information on the nature of the intraorbital lesion and may also carry risks such as bleeding or stroke.

Intra-arterial melphalan (Option C) may be effective in treating refractory scleritis, but it is not a first-line therapy. Subtenon triamcinolone (Option D) may also be effective, but it is not an immunomodulatory agent and may not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Oral flurbiprofen (Option A) is not an immunomodulatory agent and may not be effective in treating the patient's symptoms. Therefore, the best option is to initiate an alternative systemic therapy, such as an immunomodulatory agent, to address the underlying immune-mediated cause of the patient's symptoms.

Answer: B
Explanation:
The patient has a large, recurrent cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the right temple and brow with orbital extension, which has caused erosion through the right sphenoid wing, involvement of the lacrimal gland, and abutment of the lateral rectus. The patient is strongly against an orbital exenteration. In this scenario, neoadjuvant cemiplimab immunotherapy (anti–PD-L1 antibody), globe sparing orbitotomy, and surgical excision of the mass would be the most appropriate treatment strategy. This approach would allow for preservation of the globe and would address the orbital component of the disease while also providing systemic therapy to address any potential distant disease. Partial debulking of the temple mass followed by cetuximab treatment may be inadequate to address the full extent of the disease, and palliative radiotherapy may not be sufficient to control the disease. Platinum-based chemotherapy may be effective, but it would not address the orbital component of the disease.

The presence of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and a history of cutaneous nodular melanoma also support this diagnosis. While intravitreal anti-VEGF injections may be effective in managing the exudative symptoms of AMD, they would not address the underlying cause of the disease. Performing a pars plana vitrectomy and excisional biopsy of the membrane would allow for a definitive diagnosis and potentially improve visual acuity.

The patient's history of poorly differentiated HCC, large vein involvement, and treatment with nivolumab, an immune checkpoint inhibitor, also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the absence of overt viral cytopathic effects and negative immunostaining results for Helicobacter pylori, cytomegalovirus, and adenovirus suggest that the gastritis is not caused by an infectious agent. Portal hypertensive gastropathy, liver cancer progression, and infectious gastritis are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and findings.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of stridor and dysphagia, along with the physical examination findings of mild inspiratory stridor and normal vocal fold motion, suggest a diagnosis of a cystic deep neck mass. The radiologic findings of a low-density lesion abutting the trachea and hypopharynx, with rightward displacement of the trachea and larynx, are consistent with a cystic mass in the neck. The absence of any mucosal tract and the presence of extrinsic compression of the trachea, right mainstem bronchus, and esophagus support the diagnosis of a cystic mass. Hemangioma is a vascular tumor that can cause respiratory symptoms, but it typically presents with a different set of symptoms and physical examination findings. Thymic cyst and foregut duplication cyst are both rare congenital anomalies that can cause respiratory symptoms, but they typically have different radiologic findings. Lymphatic malformation is a rare congenital anomaly that can cause respiratory symptoms, but it typically has different radiologic findings and is not typically associated with stridor or dysphagia.

The cyst in the case is lined by keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium with hair follicles and sebaceous glands, which is consistent with an epidermoid cyst. Additionally, the presence of yellowish fluid in the cyst and the absence of fistular openings around the auricle or in the external auditory canal support the diagnosis of an epidermoid cyst. Pilomatricoma (A) is a benign tumor that arises from the hair matrix and is usually located in the scalp, not in the postauricular area. Type 1 first branchial cleft cyst (C) is a rare congenital malformation that occurs in the lateral neck, not in the postauricular area.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of widespread pruritic papulonodular skin lesions on the extremities and trunk, with marked hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and irregular elongation of the rete ridges, along with a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate and linear deposition of immunoglobulin G along the basement membrane zone on biopsy, are consistent with the diagnosis of epidermolysis bullosa pruriginosa (EBP). EBP is a rare autoimmune bullous disorder characterized by the formation of pruritic papulonodular lesions and blisters on the skin, mucous membranes, and conjunctivae. The patient's history of widespread skin lesions, failure to respond to previous treatments, and negative routine laboratory tests also support this diagnosis. Prurigo nodularis (option A) typically presents with crusted nodules on the face, neck, and extremities, and is often associated with atopic dermatitis. Acquired perforating dermatosis (option B) is characterized by the formation of papules, nodules, and plaques with a characteristic "perforating" appearance, and is often associated with diabetes mellitus and/or chronic kidney disease. Pemphigoid nodularis (option D) typically presents with tense, blister-like nodules on the skin, and is often associated with a positive direct immunofluorescence test for immunoglobulin G and/or complement.

Answer: C
Explanation: The clinical case describes numerous angiomatous lesions in an infant, which is consistent with the diagnosis of multifocal lymphangioendotheliomatosis with thrombocytopenia (option C). The patient's history of numerous bright red macules, papules, and plaques with hemorrhagic crust and dark scale, as well as the presence of retrognathia, thickened maxillary frenulum, and anterior ankyloglossia, are all consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the low-power view of histopathology findings demonstrating epidermal hyperplasia and an upper dermal vascular proliferation (hematoxylin-eosin section) supports this diagnosis.

The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and clinical findings. Option A, multifocal infantile hemangioma, is a benign vascular tumor that typically appears as a solitary or multiple, well-circumscribed, red or purple papules or nodules on the skin. While it is possible for infantile hemangioma to have multiple lesions, the presence of hemorrhagic crust and dark scale, as well as the patient's history of retrognathia, thickened maxillary frenulum, and anterior ankyloglossia, are not consistent with this diagnosis.

Option B, bacillary angiomatosis, is a rare condition caused by infection with Bartonella henselae bacteria. It typically presents with solitary or multiple, painless, red or purple papules or nodules on the skin, and may be associated with fever, headache, and swollen lymph nodes. The patient's history of numerous lesions, as well as the presence of hemorrhagic crust and dark scale, are not consistent with this diagnosis.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of left-eye ptosis, hypotropia, and impaired supraduction are consistent with a posterior communicating artery aneurysm (PCoA) that is not picked up on CT angiography. The absence of other cranial nerve deficits, normal laboratory test results, and negative serology for autoimmune disorders support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's lack of symptoms such as headaches, facial numbness, dysarthria, facial droop, dysphagia, or limb weakness or numbness, which are commonly associated with myasthenia gravis, makes option A less likely. Option B, Holmes Adie pupil, is not consistent with the patient's symptoms or examination findings. Option D, neurovascular conflict of the oculomotor nerve, is a possibility, but the absence of other cranial nerve deficits and the presence of a nonreactive left pupil on direct and consensual light reflexes make it less likely than a PCoA aneurysm.

Answer: C
Explanation:
The case presented is a classic case of a congenital hypertrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE). CHRPE is a benign condition that is often diagnosed in children and young adults. The clinical features of CHRPE, such as a white, translucent solid lesion with calcification, mild underlying chorioretinal changes, and associated vitreous seeds, are all present in this case. Additionally, the absence of signs of internal vascularization or vitritis and the intraretinal location of the lesion on optical coherence tomography also support this diagnosis.

Therefore, the next step would be to request genetic testing to confirm the diagnosis and monitor the patient for any changes in the lesion. Biopsy of the lesion may also be considered to confirm the diagnosis, but this may not be necessary given the classic clinical features of CHRPE. Orbital magnetic resonance imaging may also be considered to rule out other orbital lesions, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. Infectious diseases are unlikely to cause this type of lesion, so ruling them out may not be necessary.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and clinical findings suggest that she may have a fungal infection, rather than bacterial endophthalmitis, which was previously treated with antibiotics. The numerous white retinal lesions and the presence of vitritis are consistent with fungal infection. The fact that the lesions are preretinal, as demonstrated by optical coherence tomography, supports this diagnosis. Repeating intravitreal antibiotics (Option A) may not be effective against a fungal infection, and may even exacerbate the condition. Observation (Option C) may not be appropriate given the severity of the symptoms and the potential for further vision loss.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of ocular larva migrans, which is caused by the migration of parasitic larvae in the eye. The presence of a painful and pruritic lower eyelid lesion with a vermiform appearance, followed by conjunctival swelling and whitish linear opacities, is highly suggestive of this diagnosis. The fact that the patient had recently immigrated from rural Moldova 1 month prior to presentation and had exposure to farm animals, including dogs and cats, increases the likelihood of this diagnosis.

The best course of action would be to perform a biopsy of the conjunctival lesion, including a fresh specimen for flow cytometry, to confirm the diagnosis of ocular larva migrans. This would allow for appropriate treatment to be initiated, which may include antiparasitic medication and surgical removal of the parasite.

Cryotherapy of the conjunctival lesion and adjuvant therapy with interferon alfa-2b (option A) may be effective in treating some types of conjunctival lesions, but it is not the most appropriate treatment for ocular larva migrans. Injection of subconjunctival lidocaine followed by surgical removal of the lesion (option B) may be necessary for some cases, but it is not the most appropriate first step in management. Oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and topical corticosteroids (option D) are not effective in treating ocular larva migrans and may not be necessary for this patient.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of a slow-growing mass in the buccinator space, along with the imaging findings of a well-circumscribed lesion abutting the parotid duct and demonstrating a peripheral rim of hyperenhancing soft tissue with a central cystic/necrotic component, are consistent with a diagnosis of neurofibroma. The negative immunostaining for CK8/18, S100, and SOX10, and the positive staining for STAT6, also support this diagnosis. Neurofibromas are benign tumors that arise from the peripheral nervous system and are characterized by a mixture of neoplastic and non-neoplastic cells. They can occur in various locations, including the head and neck. Myopericytoma (A) is a rare benign tumor that arises from the pericytic cells that surround blood vessels, and typically has a more aggressive appearance on imaging. Synovial sarcoma (B) is a malignant tumor that arises from the synovial tissue of joints, bursae, or tendons, and typically has a more irregular shape and a higher mitotic rate than neurofibroma. Solitary fibrous tumor (D) is a rare benign tumor that arises from the mesenchyme and typically has a more spindle-shaped appearance on imaging.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of congenital left hemifacial weakness and chronic unilateral left-sided hearing loss, along with the findings of cerebral MRI and temporal bone CT, are consistent with a diagnosis of neuromuscular choristoma. This is a rare benign tumor that originates from the nerve sheath cells and typically affects the cranial nerves, especially the facial nerve. The tumor's location in the internal auditory canal, its extension to the distal branches of the facial nerve, and its hypointensity on T2 and isointensity on T1, are all consistent with a neuromuscular choristoma. The absence of intraparenchymal extension also supports this diagnosis.

The other options are less likely:

A. Facial nerve schwannoma: This is a benign tumor that originates from the Schwann cells of the facial nerve. However, the patient's symptoms and imaging findings are not consistent with a facial nerve schwannoma, as the tumor would likely be located within the facial nerve and cause more severe symptoms.

B. Vestibular nerve schwannoma: This is a benign tumor that originates from the Schwann cells of the vestibular nerve. However, the patient's symptoms and imaging findings are not consistent with a vestibular nerve schwannoma, as the tumor would likely be located within the vestibular nerve and cause more severe symptoms.

D. Hemangioma: This is a benign tumor that originates from the blood vessels. However, the patient's symptoms and imaging findings are not consistent with a hemangioma, as the tumor would likely be located within the blood vessels and cause more severe symptoms.

Explanation: The patient's history of immunoglobulin A monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance, combined with the rapid progression of the lesion and the absence of other symptoms, suggests a diagnosis of Coccidioidomycosis. This fungal infection is endemic in Southern California and can cause skin lesions, including violaceous plaques and ulcers, as well as rapid progression and scarring. The patient's travel to Kenya may also suggest exposure to other fungal or bacterial pathogens, but the absence of other symptoms and the patient's history of immunoglobulin A monoclonal gammopathy support a diagnosis of Coccidioidomycosis. A punch biopsy was performed for histopathological analysis and tissue cultures, which would help to confirm the diagnosis. The negative QuantiFERON-TB Gold test result rules out tuberculosis. Pyoderma gangrenosum (A) is a possibility, but the absence of other symptoms and the patient's history of immunoglobulin A monoclonal gammopathy make it less likely. Lupus vulgaris (B) is also a possibility, but the patient's age and the absence of other symptoms make it less likely.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient presents with a regular supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) with a rate of 178 beats/min and a 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) ratio, consistent with a re-entry tachycardia. The presence of complete right bundle branch block (RBBB) in every third beat suggests that the arrhythmia is originating from a supraventricular source, likely the atrioventricular (AV) node. The variability in ventricular cycle lengths indicates that the tachycardia is not a stable ventricular rhythm. Given the patient's history of mitral valve repair, there is a high likelihood that the arrhythmia is related to the surgery. In this case, it would be appropriate to place a temporary pacemaker to control the ventricular rate and prevent ventricular arrhythmias, while starting treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin and amiodarone to prevent stroke and control the arrhythmia. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of bilateral limited mobility of joints, along with the presence of the "prayer sign" and "groove sign," are consistent with deep morphea (morphea profunda), which is a type of scleroderma. The patient's age and lack of other symptoms, such as Raynaud phenomenon, also support this diagnosis. Myotonic dystrophy (Answer A) can cause muscle stiffness and limited mobility, but it is not typically associated with skin changes such as those seen in this patient. Systemic sclerosis (Answer B) can also cause skin thickening and limited mobility, but it is typically associated with more widespread skin involvement and other symptoms such as Raynaud phenomenon. Eosinophilic fasciitis (Answer D) is a rare condition that can cause skin thickening and limited mobility, but it is typically associated with a higher level of eosinophilia and other symptoms such as fever and weight loss.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient has recurrent skin, nail, and oral mucosal abnormalities that have previously responded to oral itraconazole. The patient's history of recurrent infections, the presence of fungal elements on potassium hydroxide wet mount preparation of skin scrapings, and the growth of Candida albicans on fungal culture suggest that the patient has chronic candidiasis. Restarting daily oral itraconazole would be an appropriate next step in managing the patient's condition. Oral cefazolin (option A) is an antibiotic that would not be effective against fungal infections. Hydrocortisone cream (option B) may be useful for skin inflammation but would not treat the underlying fungal infection. Oral terbinafine (option D) is an antifungal medication that could be considered as an alternative to itraconazole, but it would not be the most appropriate choice given the patient's history of response to itraconazole and the lack of resistance to this medication.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of right lagophthalmos, incomplete eyelid closure, and upper eyelid retraction suggest a possible diagnosis of blepharospasm or eyelid myokymia. Upper eyelid gold weight implantation is a treatment option for blepharospasm that has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms. It is important to note that the patient's history of a functional pituitary adenoma and tamoxifen therapy may also need to be taken into account when considering the patient's overall treatment plan, but they do not directly relate to the patient's current symptoms of eyelid retraction and lagophthalmos. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate next step in the patient's management.

Explanation:
The patient's history of cutaneous melanoma and the presence of a pigmented corneal mass suggest the possibility of a metastatic lesion. However, the absence of any other symptoms or signs of intraocular melanoma, such as ectropion uvea, corectopia, or feeder vessels, makes it less likely that the lesion is a metastasis. Additionally, the patient's history of refractory colitis and recent colectomy suggest that immunosuppression may be a concern, and the use of corticosteroids may be inappropriate. Given these factors, close observation with regular follow-up would be the most appropriate next step to monitor for any changes in the lesion or potential progression to melanoma, rather than immediate surgical intervention or corticosteroid therapy.

Answer: A
Explanation: Intravascular anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that primarily affects the skin and can infiltrate blood vessels. The patient's symptoms, such as the gradual enlargement of erythematous-infiltrated patches and plaques on the scalp and face, and the presence of mild erosions on the surface of the lesions, are consistent with the diagnosis of cutaneous ALCL. The biopsy results also support this diagnosis, as they reveal sheets of medium to large mononuclear cells infiltrating the dermis, some of which fill and expand apparent dermal blood vessels, and have large, irregular, pleomorphic nuclei. Additionally, the immunohistochemical stain showed that the tumor cells were positive for CD3 and negative for CD20, AE1/AE3, CK20, chromogranin A, and melan-A, which is consistent with the immunophenotype of ALCL. The high Ki-67 labeling index of 70% also suggests a high proliferative rate, which is typical of ALCL. In contrast, large B-cell lymphoma would typically have a different immunophenotype, with positivity for CD20 and negativity for CD3. Metastatic carcinoma would not have the characteristic infiltration of blood vessels by malignant cells, and natural killer/T-cell lymphoma would have a different immunophenotype and clinical presentation.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, including the inverted V deformity of the nasal septum, nasal passages obstruction, and diffuse skin plaques with erythema, are consistent with lepromatous leprosy. The patient's history of hypopigmented cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides type) and treatment with narrowband UV-B phototherapy and triamcinolone cream also support this diagnosis. The presence of poorly formed granulomas in the skin lesion, as shown in the hematoxylin-eosin stain (Figure 1B), is also consistent with lepromatous leprosy. The Fite acid-fast stain (Figure 1A) identifying pink bacilli in the cutaneous lesion further supports this diagnosis, as lepromatous leprosy is caused by Mycobacterium leprae, which stains positive with Fite stain.

Therefore, option C, lepromatous leprosy, is the correct diagnosis.

Option A, sarcoidosis, is an inflammatory disease that can cause nasal septal deformity and skin lesions, but it does not typically cause diffuse skin plaques with erythema, and the presence of poorly formed granulomas in the skin lesion is not consistent with sarcoidosis.

Option B, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, is a systemic vasculitis that can cause nasal septal deformity and skin lesions, but it typically presents with more prominent granulomas and does not have the characteristic hypopigmentation of lepromatous leprosy.

Option D, progression of mycosis fungoides, is unlikely given the patient's history of treatment with narrowband UV-B phototherapy and triamcinolone cream, which would be expected to control the disease. Additionally, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not support this diagnosis.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, along with the results of the laboratory tests and flexible transnasal videolaryngoscopy, are consistent with tuberculosis. The patient's history of travel to countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis, such as Pakistan, Turkey, Jordan, Israel, Qatar, and Dubai, increases her risk of exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The lesion on the laryngeal surface of the right epiglottis passing midline and extending to the right aryepiglottic fold, but not involving the true vocal cords, is consistent with a tuberculous ulcer. The presence of granulation tissue, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, and atypia in the laryngeal biopsy specimen also supports the diagnosis of tuberculosis. Therefore, option C, Tuberculosis, is the most likely diagnosis.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive hoarseness and dyspnea, along with the physical examination findings of stridulous and hoarse voice, and the videostroboscopy and CT scan findings of severe laryngeal mucosal edema, irregularity of the true vocal folds, and absence of a neoplasm or cervical lymphadenopathy, are consistent with a diagnosis of laryngeal squamous cell cancer. The patient's age and lack of history of smoking, head and neck surgeries, or radiation exposure also support this diagnosis. Squamous cell cancer is a common type of cancer that affects the larynx and can cause symptoms such as hoarseness and dyspnea. The biopsy findings of edematous, irregular, friable laryngeal mucosa with significant airway narrowing and the presence of squamous cell carcinoma on histopathology (Figure 1, B and C) further support this diagnosis. Sarcoidosis, blastomycosis, and tuberculosis can also cause laryngeal symptoms, but the patient's symptoms and examination findings are not consistent with these diagnoses.

Answer: C
Explanation: The clinical presentation of multiple skin-colored subcutaneous nodules, joint deformity, and systemic symptoms such as decreased oral intake, decreased activity, and delayed motor development, along with the histopathological findings of a granulomatous pattern, numerous foamy cells, marked collagen degeneration, and mucin deposition, are consistent with the diagnosis of Farber disease (disseminated lipogranuloma). The presence of comma-shaped curvilinear tubular structures on histopathology further supports this diagnosis. Farber disease is a rare autosomal recessive disorder caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme acid ceramidase, leading to the accumulation of ceramides in various tissues, including the skin and joints. The age of onset and distribution of the nodules, as well as the associated joint deformity and systemic symptoms, are all consistent with this diagnosis.

The other options do not fit the clinical presentation and histopathological findings of the case. Multicentric reticulohistiocytosis (Option A) is a rare disorder characterized by the proliferation of histiocytes and the formation of nodules in various parts of the body, but it does not present with the same skin and joint manifestations as Farber disease. Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis (Option B) is a rare benign tumor that affects the skin and subcutaneous tissue, but it does not have the systemic symptoms or histopathological findings seen in this case. Rheumatoid nodules (Option D) are a manifestation of rheumatoid arthritis, but they are typically found in the setting of long-standing arthritis and do not have the same histopathological features as Farber disease.

Answer: C: Immunoglobulin G4–related disease
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of diplopia, ptosis, and progressive headache, along with the physical examination findings of bilateral extraocular muscle weakness and limitation of elevation and abduction, are consistent with Immunoglobulin G4–related disease (IgG4-RD). This is a rare autoimmune disorder that can affect various organs, including the ocular muscles. The patient's history of thyroiditis and supraventricular tachycardia also supports this diagnosis, as these are known associations with IgG4-RD. Additionally, the MRI findings of diffuse edema and enhancement of the scalp, skull base, neck, and paraspinal soft tissues, as well as T2 hyperintensity and enhancement of the extraocular muscles bilaterally, are consistent with IgG4-RD. Giant cell arteritis (option A) is a possible diagnosis, but the patient's age and lack of symptoms such as jaw claudication and scalp tenderness make it less likely. Anti–transfer RNA synthetase myositis (option B) is a rare condition that can cause myositis and interstitial lung disease, but it is not typically associated with ocular muscle weakness. Myasthenia gravis (option D) can cause ocular muscle weakness, but the patient's lack of fatigue, rest, or ice-pack test findings and the presence of bilateral extraocular muscle weakness make it less likely.

Answer: C: Perform an electrooculogram and molecular genetic testing.
Explanation: The clinical case presented is suggestive of bilateral refractory neurosensory retinal and pigment epithelial detachments. The patient has a history of presumed exudative age-related macular degeneration and has received 32 near monthly injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) with persistent subretinal fluid (SRF) and enlarging pigment epithelial detachments (PEDs) in each eye. The presence of yellow subretinal deposits located within an inferior macular detachment in the right eye suggests central serous chorioretinopathy.

Given the patient's history and clinical presentation, it is important to consider the possibility of a genetic disorder that may be contributing to the development of these detachments. Performing an electrooculogram and molecular genetic testing can help identify any underlying genetic abnormalities that may be contributing to the patient's condition. This information can be useful in guiding further management and treatment decisions.

Option A, continuing intravitreal anti-VEGF injections, may not be the most appropriate next step as the patient has already received numerous injections with persistent SRF and PEDs. Option B, starting photodynamic therapy, may also not be appropriate as the patient's condition does not meet the criteria for photodynamic therapy. Option D, obtaining serum protein electrophoresis and immunofixation test, may not provide useful information in this case as the patient's symptoms are not suggestive of a systemic disorder.

Answer: B: Genetic testing
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive vision loss, nyctalopia, and cognitive impairments suggest a possible genetic cause. The family history of unilateral vision loss in the paternal grandmother also supports this possibility. Genetic testing can help identify potential genetic causes of the patient's condition, such as retinal dystrophy or other inherited eye disorders. This information can guide further management and counseling for the patient and her family.

While an electroretinogram (Option A) can evaluate the function of the retina, it may not provide definitive information on the underlying genetic cause of the patient's condition. Observation (Option C) may not be the most appropriate choice, as the patient's vision loss is progressive and further evaluation is needed to determine the underlying cause and guide management. A muscle biopsy (Option D) is unlikely to provide useful information in this case, as the patient's symptoms are primarily related to her vision and cognitive function, rather than muscle weakness or wasting.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of recurrent and recalcitrant salivary gland swelling, pruritus, and eosinophilia are consistent with Sjogren syndrome, an autoimmune disorder that affects the exocrine glands, particularly the salivary and lacrimal glands. The patient's negative serology results for antinuclear antibodies, rheumatoid factor, anti-Ro (SS-A), and anti-La (SS-B) do not rule out Sjogren syndrome, as these tests are not always positive in early stages of the disease. The patient's eosinophilia and the presence of eosinophils in the periductal inflammatory infiltrate on histopathology also support this diagnosis. Eosinophilic sialodochitis (option A) is a rare condition characterized by eosinophilic inflammation of the salivary glands, but it is usually associated with a history of allergy or asthma, which is not mentioned in the patient's history. Sialolithiasis (option C) is the formation of stones in the salivary glands, which is not supported by the patient's clinical presentation or imaging findings.

Answer: C
Explanation: A plunging ranula is a type of congenital cystic neck mass that is derived from the remnants of the embryonic ranula, which is a temporary structure that helps to develop the floor of the mouth during embryonic development. The ranula usually disappears by the 12th week of gestation, but in some cases, it can persist and form a cystic mass. The clinical presentation of a plunging ranula typically includes a painless, slowly growing mass in the neck that may or may not be associated with swallowing difficulties. The mass may also be mobile or fixed, and it may have a thin, irregular capsule. Imaging studies, such as ultrasonography, CT, or MRI, are useful in confirming the diagnosis and assessing the extent of the mass. Treatment for a plunging ranula usually involves surgical excision of the cystic mass, and in some cases, the associated cranial nerves may also need to be repaired.

In this case, the patient presented with a left upper neck mass that was first noted at birth, and the mass had not changed in size over the past 2 months. The patient had no fevers, constitutional symptoms, or enlargement of the mass, which suggests that the mass was not inflammatory or infectious in nature. The ultrasonography and CT findings were consistent with a cystic mass, and the MRI findings showed a large, multiseptated cystic structure with a mildly thickened capsule. The patient's age and the presence of a tongue musculature involvement also support the diagnosis of a plunging ranula.

Foregut duplication cyst (option A) is less likely because it typically presents with respiratory symptoms, such as stridor or wheezing, and the cyst is usually located in the mediastinum or trachea. Branchial cleft cyst (option B) is also less likely because it typically presents with a neck mass or swelling in the lateral neck, and the cyst is usually located near the sternocleidomastoid muscle.

Answer: C. Microvenular hemangioma
Explanation: The clinical appearance of an ill-defined, nonindurated, erythematous-violaceous plaque with an atrophic appearance, as well as the histopathological findings of round vascular channels lined by a single layer of endothelial cells without atypia, are consistent with a diagnosis of microvenular hemangioma. This type of hemangioma is characterized by small, dilated blood vessels that are arranged in a microvenular pattern. The lack of a grenz zone and the presence of CD34 immunostaining, which labels endothelial cells, support this diagnosis. In contrast, poikilodermatous plaque-like hemangioma (option A) typically has a more defined border and a grenz zone, and acquired elastotic hemangioma (option B) is characterized by elastosis and a more prominent grenz zone. Acroangiodermatitis (option D) is a condition that affects the skin and subcutaneous tissue, but it does not have the same histopathological features as microvenular hemangioma.

Answer: B: Electrophysiology study
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of recurrent syncope and shaking, along with a family history of sudden cardiac death in a second cousin, suggest the possibility of a cardiac arrhythmia. The electrocardiogram (ECG) does not show any obvious abnormalities, so an electrophysiology study (EPS) would be the next appropriate step to evaluate the patient's arrhythmia risk and determine the underlying cause of his symptoms. An EPS can help identify any abnormal electrical pathways in the heart and guide further management, which may include implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) if necessary. A 30-day ambulatory event monitor (Option A) may also be considered, but an EPS is more appropriate given the patient's symptoms and family history. Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (Option C) and ventricular ablation (Option D) are not appropriate at this stage, as they are invasive procedures that should only be considered after a definitive diagnosis has been made.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a possible diagnosis of chronic lead poisoning. The patient's history of cholecystectomy and appendectomy increases the likelihood of lead absorption from the gut. The bluish pigmentation along the gingival margin (Figure, panel A) is consistent with lead line, a common sign of chronic lead poisoning. The patient's elevated alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransaminase levels and direct bilirubin level are also consistent with lead-induced liver damage. Additionally, the patient's anemia and low ferritin level may be due to lead-induced erythropoietin suppression. Therefore, it is appropriate to check the patient's blood lead concentration to confirm the diagnosis.

The other options do not address the patient's symptoms and laboratory results as directly:

Option A, checking blood lead concentration, is the most appropriate next step in diagnosing and managing the patient's condition.

Option C, performing flow cytometry, may be useful in diagnosing certain hematological disorders, but it is not directly related to the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

Answer: D Start acetazolamide.
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of bilateral retro-orbital pain, blurred vision, wavy lines in vision, numbness, and tingling in hands and legs, along with the physical examination findings of bilateral grade 1 optic disc edema, suggest that she may have a condition that affects the optic nerve. The patient's history of mild obesity and elevated intracranial pressure on lumbar puncture also support this diagnosis. Acetazolamide is a medication that can help to reduce intracranial pressure and alleviate symptoms of papilledema. Therefore, starting acetazolamide would be an appropriate next step in management.

Fluorescein angiography (option A) may be useful in evaluating the retinal circulation, but it would not be the most appropriate next step in management given the patient's symptoms and examination findings.
Serum vascular endothelial growth factor (option B) may be elevated in certain conditions that affect the optic nerve, but it is not typically used in the evaluation of papilledema.

Answer: C
Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of severe bilateral periorbital swelling, chemosis, ophthalmoplegia, and proptosis, along with the MRI findings of bilateral and symmetric tendon-sparing extraocular muscle enlargement, are consistent with thyroid eye disease (TED). However, the patient has a history of metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoid tumor (NET) and is in remission after liver transplant, which increases the likelihood of an alternative diagnosis.

 option A, starting intravenous corticosteroids for presumed serology-negative TED, may not be the best course of action since the patient's history of NET increases the likelihood of an alternative diagnosis.

 option B, obtaining PET-CT imaging to look for additional metastases and biopsy sites, may not provide information specific to the patient's ocular symptoms and may not be necessary at this time.

 option D, coordinating with the primary team for treatment with octreotide, may be appropriate for managing the patient's NET, but it does not address the patient's ocular symptoms.

Answer: D
Explanation:
The clinical presentation of an asymptomatic, slowly growing, reddish verrucous plaque on the right temple, along with the histopathological findings of papillomatous epidermal hyperplasia, edema of dermal papillae, and neoplastic infiltration consisting of small round blue cells with alternating areas of dense and loose cellularity, are consistent with a diagnosis of primary cutaneous embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). This type of RMS typically affects children and young adults and often presents as a slowly growing, painless mass in the skin or subcutaneous tissue. The presence of MyoD1 positivity in the tumor cells, as shown in the histopathological examination, supports this diagnosis.

The other options do not fit the clinical and histopathological findings:

A. Superficial lymphatic malformation: This is an incorrect diagnosis as it does not match the clinical presentation of a slowly growing, reddish verrucous plaque, and the histopathological findings do not show any evidence of lymphatic malformation.

B. Primary superficial Ewing sarcoma: This is an incorrect diagnosis as Ewing sarcoma typically presents as a painful mass in the soft tissue or bone, and the histopathological findings do not show the characteristic features of Ewing sarcoma.

C. Lymphoblastic lymphoma: This is an incorrect diagnosis as lymphoblastic lymphoma typically presents with symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and night sweats, and the histopathological findings do not show any evidence of lymphoma.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including pancytopenia, septic shock, and recurrent oral and perianal ulcers, suggest a diagnosis of Epstein-Barr virus-positive mucocutaneous ulcers. The presence of white plaques on the tongue and external anal mucosa, as well as the histopathological findings of a mixed infiltrate of histiocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and eosinophils with prominent admixed large and atypical cells, are consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the positive Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNA staining result supports this diagnosis. While chronic ulcerative herpes simplex virus (Option A) and Crohn disease associated with pyostomatitis vegetans (Option C) could also present with ulcers, the patient's history of poorly controlled HIV and the presence of thrush suggest a viral etiology for the ulcers. Fungal infection (Option D) is less likely given the patient's recent treatment with fluconazole and the absence of other signs of fungal infection.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of bilateral complete ophthalmoplegia, decreased sensation to light touch and pinprick in the V1/V2 distribution of the trigeminal nerve bilaterally, and absence of pupillary response to light or accommodation are consistent with pituitary apoplexy. The presence of a large sellar mass with extension into the cavernous sinus and compression of the optic chiasm supports this diagnosis. The loss of enhancement on T2-weighted images and absence of central enhancement on MRI also suggest that the mass is not a pituitary adenoma, but rather a pituitary apoplexy. Orbital compartment syndrome (A) is unlikely given the absence of proptosis, chemosis, or orbital pain. Ocular motor apraxia (B) is also unlikely given the presence of bilateral complete ophthalmoplegia and the absence of any other cranial nerve palsies. Cavernous sinus thrombosis (D) is unlikely given the absence of any other symptoms or signs of sinus thrombosis, such as proptosis, chemosis, or ophthalmoplegia.

Answer: D
Explanation: The patient's history of intravenous heroin use and chronic inactive hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection with a low serum HBV DNA value, normal liver enzyme values, and no evidence of cirrhosis suggests that she may have been exposed to hepatitis delta virus (HDV) through shared needles. HDV is a defective virus that requires the presence of HBV to replicate and can cause acute or chronic hepatitis in individuals with HBV infection. The patient's symptoms of jaundice and malaise, as well as the absence of other causes of liver disease, support the possibility of HDV infection. Therefore, it is appropriate to order testing for HDV IgM and IgG antibodies and, if positive, test for HDV RNA to confirm the diagnosis.

The other options do not address the patient's symptoms or medical history. Option A, checking the plasma HIV-1 RNA level, is not relevant to the patient's symptoms or medical history, and HIV infection is not associated with HDV infection. Option B, ordering testing for hepatitis E virus IgM antibody, may be appropriate if the patient had a history of travel to an area where hepatitis E is endemic or had consumed raw meat, but there is no indication of this in the patient's history. Option C, ordering testing for anti–smooth muscle antibody, is not relevant to the patient's symptoms or medical history and is not typically ordered in the evaluation of liver disease.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of recurrent eye and ear pain, along with the physical examination findings of scleral erythema and auricular erythema, suggest a possible diagnosis of ocular and auricular inflammation. The laboratory test results, particularly the elevated ESR and CRP, support this diagnosis. The patient's history of similar episodes in the past also suggests a chronic inflammatory condition. Given these findings, the best next step would be to prescribe prednisone, a corticosteroid that can help reduce inflammation. This would be a safe and effective treatment option for the patient.

Chest radiography and pulmonary function testing (PFT) (option A) may be necessary to rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a pulmonary infection or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, based on the patient's history and physical examination findings, inflammation is a more likely diagnosis.

Performing a biopsy of the left ear (option B) may be unnecessary and invasive at this stage, as the patient's symptoms and laboratory test results suggest a systemic inflammatory condition rather than a localized infection or cancer.

Prescribing ibuprofen (option D) may help alleviate the patient's pain and inflammation, but it would not address the underlying cause of the inflammation. Corticosteroids, such as prednisone, are more effective in reducing inflammation and would be a better choice for this patient.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressively worsening unilateral ptosis, particularly at night and with fatigue, suggest a possible myogenic or neurogenic cause. Although the patient has a history of hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and chronic migraines, there is no evidence of lid edema, erythema, or tenderness to palpation, which might suggest an inflammatory or infectious cause. The absence of any other neurologic deficits also argues against a central nervous system disorder. Given the patient's symptoms and examination findings, single-fiber electromyography (SFEMG) would be the most appropriate next step to evaluate the integrity of the levator palpebrae superioris muscle and its innervation. SFEMG can help distinguish between myogenic and neurogenic causes of ptosis by assessing the muscle's electrical activity and morphology. It can also help identify any abnormalities in the neuromuscular junction or muscle fibers. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of sudden-onset headache, nausea, and binocular vertical diplopia, along with the physical examination findings of minimal limitation in infraduction in the left eye with corresponding left hypertropia, suggest a possible diagnosis of thyroid-related orbitopathy. Thyroid-related orbitopathy is an autoimmune disorder that can cause inflammation in the tissues surrounding the thyroid gland, leading to swelling and compression of the extraocular muscles and orbital tissues. This can result in diplopia, lid swelling, and limitation of eye movements.

The patient's history of hyperprolactinemia and galactorrhea also supports this diagnosis, as thyroid-related orbitopathy is more common in patients with thyroid dysfunction. Therefore, it is appropriate to check thyrotropin and thyroid receptor autoantibody levels to confirm the diagnosis. Additionally, ordering orbital imaging, such as a CT or MRI scan, can help to identify any inflammation or swelling in the orbit and further support the diagnosis.

The other options are not as appropriate for this patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Option A, checking thyrotropin and thyroid receptor autoantibody levels, is already included in the correct answer. Option B, ordering acetylcholine receptor antibody level titers, is not relevant to this patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, as acetylcholine receptor antibodies are not typically associated with thyroid-related orbitopathy. Option D, performing urgent lumbar puncture, is not necessary at this time, as there is no evidence of a serious intracranial condition, such as a stroke or bleed, that would require emergent evaluation.

Answer: D
Explanation: Performing a biopsy of the ocular surface lesion would be the most appropriate next step in management. The patient's symptoms of progressive vision loss, along with the physical examination findings of a subluxed PCIOL and vitreous prolapse into the anterior chamber, suggest that the subluxation may be caused by an underlying inflammatory or infectious process. The superonasal pigmented scleral lesion may represent a focus of inflammation or infection that is contributing to the subluxation. A biopsy of the lesion would help to determine the underlying cause and guide further management. Intraocular lens suture fixation or exchange (option A) may be necessary if the subluxation is caused by a mechanical issue, but this would not address any underlying inflammatory or infectious cause. Ordering ultrasound biomicroscopy (option B) or anterior segment optical coherence tomography (option C) may provide additional information about the structure of the eye, but would not provide a definitive diagnosis of the underlying cause of the subluxation.

Answer: D: Perform therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty of the right eye.
Explanation: The patient's bilateral corneal ulcers and severe dry eye are indicative of a corneal perforation, which can be caused by a variety of factors, including infection, trauma, or chemical burns. Given the patient's history of rubbing his eyes and the presence of bilateral corneal epithelial defects, it is likely that the ulcers are caused by a mechanical irritation or trauma. Therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty is a surgical procedure that involves replacing the damaged corneal tissue with healthy donor tissue. This procedure is usually recommended for patients with corneal perforations or impending perforations, as it can help to restore vision and prevent further complications.

Allergy testing and initiating topical steroids (option A) may be necessary to manage any underlying allergic conditions that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms, but it would not address the underlying cause of the corneal ulcers.

Checking serum vitamin A levels (option B) may be relevant for patients with night blindness or other retinal symptoms, but it is not directly related to the patient's corneal ulcers.

Obtaining corneal herpes simplex viral cultures (option C) may be appropriate if the patient had a history of herpes simplex virus (HSV) keratitis, but there is no mention of such a history in the case description.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of sudden onset and unremitting vertigo, along with the physical examination findings of a strongly positive right-sided Dix-Hallpike test and rotary nystagmus, are consistent with a diagnosis of labyrinthitis. Labyrinthitis is an inner ear infection that affects the labyrinth, which includes the cochlea, vestibular system, and semicircular canals. The patient's hearing loss, as shown on the audiogram, is also consistent with labyrinthitis. The presence of a bilateral high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss suggests that the infection has affected the inner ear structures responsible for hearing.

The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and examination findings as well. Superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome (Option A) is a condition where the bone covering the superior semicircular canal is absent or thin, leading to vertigo and nausea. However, this condition is typically associated with a history of recurrent episodes of vertigo, hearing loss, and tinnitus, which are not mentioned in the patient's history. Pneumolabyrinth (Option B) is a condition where air enters the inner ear and mastoid air cells, leading to symptoms such as vertigo, hearing loss, and tinnitus. However, the patient's physical examination findings and audiogram results do not support this diagnosis. Meniere disease (Option D) is a disorder of the inner ear that affects the balance and hearing, leading to symptoms such as vertigo, tinnitus, hearing loss, and a feeling of fullness in the affected ear. However, the patient's symptoms and examination findings do not fit the typical presentation of Meniere disease.

Answer: B 
Explanation: The patient's history of smoking and the presence of hematuria suggest a possible diagnosis of lymphoma. The mass in the deep lobe of the right parotid gland with extension into surrounding soft tissue spaces, as shown in the contrast-enhanced CT scan, is consistent with a lymphoma. The patient's history of coronary artery disease and prior myocardial infarction treated with warfarin may also increase the risk of bleeding complications in the setting of lymphoma. The absence of erythema or tenderness of the parotid gland and intact cranial nerves, specifically the right facial nerve and its branches, also support this diagnosis. The follow-up CT scan 6 weeks later (Figure, B) shows progression of the disease, which is consistent with lymphoma. Therefore, option B (Parotid gland lymphoma) is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as the progressive skin depressions in the neck, nape, and submandibular regions, and the atrophy in the center of the lesion surrounded by an erythematous border, are consistent with Lipodystrophia centrifugalis abdominalis infantilis (LCFA). LCFA is a rare condition characterized by the loss of subcutaneous fat in a centrifugal pattern, typically affecting the neck, face, and extremities. The ultrasonographic findings of markedly thinner subcutaneous fat of the skin, and the absence of inflammatory cell infiltration within the dermis, also support this diagnosis. Morphea (A) is a localized form of scleroderma that can cause skin thickening and atrophy, but it does not typically affect the subcutaneous fat. Lupus panniculitis (B) is an inflammatory condition that affects the subcutaneous fat, but it is not typically associated with atrophy in the center of the lesion.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including painful erythematous plaques on the trunk, abdominal discomfort, weight loss, and vaginal bleeding, suggest a systemic disease. The physical examination findings of erythematous plaques on the right chest and flank without warmth also support this. The histopathological examination results show large atypical cells with clear or eosinophilic cytoplasm forming papillary and glandular architectures in the deep dermis, which is consistent with metastatic carcinoma. Additionally, the presence of lymphovascular invasion in the superficial and deep dermis supports this diagnosis. The patient's history of a rapidly increasing mass in the lower abdomen and the contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scan of the abdomen and pelvis showing a large heterogeneous mass in the right rectus abdominis muscle and a cystic lesion in the left ovary also suggest metastatic carcinoma. Therefore, option C, Metastatic carcinoma, is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation, laboratory results, and imaging studies are consistent with a diagnosis of mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS). The patient's history of progressive parkinsonism, cognitive decline, and visual hallucinations, along with the presence of REM sleep behavior disorder and restless legs syndrome, are all consistent with MELAS. The patient's negative family history and normal laboratory results make other diagnoses, such as autosomal recessive parkinsonism or paraneoplastic syndrome, less likely. The patient's brain biopsy findings of scattered globular inclusions consistent with Lewy bodies support the diagnosis of MELAS, as Lewy bodies are a common finding in MELAS patients. Finally, the patient's FDG-PET/MRI showing hypometabolism throughout the left cerebral hemisphere and crossed cerebellar diaschisis is also consistent with MELAS, as cerebral hypometabolism and diaschisis are common findings in MELAS patients.

Answer: B
Explanation: Given the patient's history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, the presence of tender, nonfluctuant plaques on the scalp and dorsal hands, and the laboratory results showing anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, the most likely diagnosis is a neutrophilic dermatosis, specifically pyoderma gangrenosum. This diagnosis is supported by the punch biopsy findings of a dense dermal neutrophilic infiltrate with marked edema without vasculitis. Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare condition that is often associated with underlying hematological disorders, such as leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome. Therefore, the next step would be to perform a bone marrow biopsy with flow cytometry and cytogenetics to rule out an underlying hematological malignancy. Starting intravenous vancomycin without a clear diagnosis or evidence of infection may not be appropriate. Incision and drainage of the skin lesions may be considered, but it is not the most appropriate next step given the patient's history and laboratory results. Prescribing oral dapsone without a clear diagnosis and without considering other treatment options may not be effective in managing the patient's condition.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of pruritic wheals on her face, bilateral eyelid swelling, and rash that spread over her neck, chest, trunk, and arms, as well as the positive response to pressure testing with a pen cap and tongue depressor, are consistent with urticaria. The absence of other symptoms such as lip, tongue, or neck swelling, shortness of breath, wheezing, chest pain, or palpitations, suggests that the patient does not have a severe allergic reaction. The patient's history of no recent infections, travel, exposure to animals, or use of new personal care products, and her lack of a history of atopy, urticaria, angioedema, or food or drug allergy, make it less likely that the symptoms are caused by an allergic reaction. Therefore, prescribing a nonsedating antihistamine at a standard dose and increasing to a high-dose antihistamine if symptoms persist, as option C suggests, is the most appropriate next step in management.

Answer: C
Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of intermittent pain in the operative site, associated with a small lump over the left neck, and the pain being worse on touch and head turning, suggest a possible recurrent parotid tumor. The fact that the patient had a previous left superficial parotidectomy 10 years ago for a Warthin tumor, and the presence of a focus of nodular oncocytic hyperplasia in the adjacent parenchyma and reactive intraparotid lymph nodes in the previous histology results, also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the absence of any focal lesion in either parotid glands or at the area of interest over the left sternocleidomastoid muscle on the MRI scan, suggests that the recurrent tumor is likely to be located in the parenchyma rather than in the gland itself. Therefore, option C, Recurrent parotid tumor, is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: D
Explanation: The patient has a history of multiple ocular surgeries, including a scleral buckle and silicone oil injection, which increases the risk of subconjunctival hemorrhage and mass formation. The presence of a large, firm, pink subconjunctival mass near the Ahmed valve, along with a left hypertropia of more than 45°, suggests that the mass is likely to be a pyogenic granuloma. Pyogenic granulomas are known to occur in association with ocular implants, such as the Ahmed valve. Transscleral cyclophotocoagulation and removal of the mass and Ahmed valve would be the appropriate next step in management. Bleb revision with excision of the mass (option A) may be necessary if the mass is causing bleb-related complications, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. Fine-needle aspiration of the mass (option B) may be used to diagnose the mass, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, given the patient's history and the likely diagnosis of a pyogenic granuloma. Silicone oil removal from the vitreous cavity (option C) may be necessary in the future, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, given the presence of the mass and the patient's history.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of headache, malaise, recent cough, and fever, along with the physical examination findings of bilateral disc edema and peripapillary hemorrhage, are consistent with papilledema. The diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is supported by the patient's age, gender, and the absence of any other cause of papilledema. IIH is a rare condition characterized by increased intracranial pressure without an identifiable cause, and it is often associated with obesity, female gender, and a young age. The patient's slightly decreased CSF protein level and unremarkable CSF cytospin findings also support this diagnosis. Therefore, the next step would be to diagnose and treat IIH, which is option B. Repeating serial ophthalmic examinations (option A) may be necessary to monitor the progression of the disease, but it is not the most appropriate next step. Performing a bone marrow biopsy (option C) may be considered in the future if the patient's anemia and leukopenia persist or worsen, but it is not directly related to the patient's current symptoms and diagnosis. Repeating serial lumbar punctures (option D) may be necessary to monitor the patient's intracranial pressure, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this time.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's fluctuating diplopia and worsening right upper eyelid ptosis, along with the absence of anisocoria or afferent pupillary defect, suggest a possible diagnosis of myasthenia gravis (MG). MG is an autoimmune disorder that affects the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction, leading to muscle weakness and fatigue. The patient's history of hypertension increases the likelihood of MG, as hypertension is a common comorbidity in MG patients. The ice pack test, which temporarily improved the ptosis, supports the diagnosis of MG. Therefore, the next step would be to perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbit to look for any structural abnormalities or inflammation in the brain and orbit, which could be indicative of MG. Additionally, the patient's symptoms of small exotropia and supraduction deficit may also be related to MG.

Answer: D
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and findings, including unilateral yellowish eye discoloration, blurry vision, ocular pain, and subretinal fluid, are concerning for choroidal melanoma. The presence of an intraocular mass and choroidal hemorrhage also supports this diagnosis. It is important to rule out an occult systemic neoplasm, as choroidal melanoma can be associated with metastatic disease. Therefore, the next step would be to investigate for any systemic neoplasm, which is option D.

Option A, investigating liver dysfunction and biliary tract obstruction, may be relevant in cases of ocular melanoma, but there is no indication for it in this patient's case.

Option B, draining the hemorrhage with scleral windows, may be considered in cases of large choroidal hemorrhage, but it is not the most appropriate step in this case, given the presence of an intraocular mass and the need to rule out metastatic disease.

Option C, treating with plaque brachytherapy, is a treatment option for choroidal melanoma, but it would not be appropriate at this stage, as the diagnosis has not been confirmed and the patient needs further evaluation to rule out metastatic disease.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive bilateral lower extremity numbness, pain, weakness, and imbalance, along with the MRI findings of extensive spinal cord edema extending from T2 to the conus and a posterior ring-enhancing intramedullary lesion at T9 to T10, are consistent with a spinal cord infarct. The lack of mass effect and the presence of marrow hyperintensity on T1-weighted noncontrast imaging suggest that the intramedullary lesion is likely due to radiation recall myelopathy rather than metastatic progression. The patient's history of recent radiation therapy to T9 to T12 and the absence of malignant cells in the lumbar puncture also support this diagnosis. Therefore, the appropriate next step would be to work up the underlying cause of the infarct, provide supportive care, and consider adding bevacizumab to the treatment plan, as it is a known risk factor for radiation recall myelopathy.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of gradual onset of headache, jaw pain, paresthesia, and trismus, along with the physical examination findings of bilateral tenderness of the temporomandibular joints and paresthesia of the right trigeminal nerve in the V2 and V3 distribution, are consistent with a trigeminal schwannoma. The MRI findings of a cystic mass in the right side of the infratemporal fossa (ITF) that is nonenhancing on T1 sequencing with contrast and hyperintense on T2 also support this diagnosis. Trigeminal schwannomas are benign tumors that arise from the Schwann cells of the trigeminal nerve and typically present with symptoms related to compression of the nerve. The presence of a cystic component is not uncommon. Encephalocele (A) is a possibility, but the absence of any prior head trauma or surgical history and the lack of other neurological symptoms make it less likely. Deep lobe parotid tumor (B) is also a possibility, but the location of the mass in the ITF and the absence of any parotid gland enlargement or other symptoms suggestive of a parotid tumor make it less likely. Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (D) is a rare benign tumor that typically affects young males and presents with nasal bleeding, nasal obstruction, and headache. The patient's age and symptoms do not fit this diagnosis.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as thickening and swelling of the hands, burning pruritus, and excessive wrinkling on the dorsum of the hands and wrists, are consistent with aquagenic syringeal acrokeratoderma (ASA). The fact that the lesions occur as symmetrical white and transparent papules, and white keratosis, and worsen in summer and remit in winter, also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of frequent hand washing during the COVID-19 pandemic and the absence of any other skin conditions or family history of similar problems, further suggest ASA as the most likely diagnosis.

Eczema (option A) is a general term for a group of skin conditions characterized by inflammation and irritation, but it does not match the specific symptoms and characteristics described in the case.

Hereditary papulotranslucent acrokeratoderma (option C) is a rare genetic disorder that causes small, translucent bumps on the skin, but it does not match the patient's symptoms of thickening and swelling of the hands, burning pruritus, and excessive wrinkling.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient has a history of factor VII deficiency hemophilia, which is a bleeding disorder that affects the blood's ability to clot. The patient's symptoms of acute hypoxic respiratory failure and bacteremia are consistent with severe COVID-19 infection. The development of necrotic plaques on the ears, particularly on the earlobe and helix, is consistent with COVID-19-associated acroischemia, which is a rare complication of COVID-19 infection. Acroischemia is characterized by the formation of necrotic plaques on the distal parts of the body surface, such as the fingers, toes, and ears. The patient's history of factor VII deficiency hemophilia and the absence of any devices on the ears make pressure necrosis (option A) less likely. Levamisole-induced vasculitis (option B) is a rare side effect of levamisole, a medication used to treat certain parasitic infections, and is not associated with COVID-19 infection. Nonpseudomonal ecthyma gangrenosum (option D) is a rare bacterial infection that can cause skin necrosis, but it is not associated with COVID-19 infection. The patient's history of bacteremia and the absence of any skin lesions other than the necrotic plaques on the ears make this diagnosis less likely.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of painful digital ulcers, livedo racemosa, and retiform purpura on the palmar surfaces of her hands, as well as the presence of scale and fissures on several digits, are consistent with a diagnosis of systemic sclerosis (SSc). SSc is a connective tissue disease that is often associated with autoantibodies, including anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody. Therefore, it would be appropriate to order testing for anti-dsDNA antibody to support the diagnosis. A chest CT scan and myositis-specific autoantibody panel may also be useful in evaluating the patient's symptoms of dyspnea on exertion and normal strength throughout all muscle groups, but they are not directly related to the patient's skin symptoms. Anti-scl-70 and anticentromere antibodies are also commonly associated with SSc, but they are not as specific as anti-dsDNA antibody for this diagnosis. A muscle biopsy may be necessary in the future if the patient's symptoms persist or worsen, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this time.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's worsening necrotic wound and elevated procalcitonin level suggest that she may have a fungal infection, which is not responding to the current antibiotic treatment. The patient's history of methergine injection and negative blood cultures suggest that the infection is likely to be fungal in nature. The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory results are consistent with invasive fungal infection. Therefore, starting hyperbaric oxygen therapy would be an appropriate next step in management.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of joint pain and the deformity of the nasal bridge revealed upon removal of her face mask suggest a possible diagnosis of necrotizing vasculitis, a condition that can cause damage to blood vessels and lead to joint pain and deformities. The patient's history of using a nasal CPAP mask for obstructive sleep apnea may also be relevant, as it could potentially contribute to the development of necrotizing vasculitis. The patient's laboratory results, particularly the elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, also support this diagnosis. Therefore, the next step would be to obtain conventional angiography of the aorta and renal arteries to evaluate the extent of vessel damage and determine the appropriate course of treatment.

The other options do not address the likely diagnosis of necrotizing vasculitis and are therefore not the best choices:

Option A, checking ANCA titers, may be relevant for diagnosing certain autoimmune disorders, but it is not directly related to the patient's symptoms or laboratory results.

Option B, checking antinuclear antibody and complement levels, is also not directly related to the patient's symptoms or laboratory results and is not specific to the suspected diagnosis of necrotizing vasculitis.

Option D, ordering a rapid plasma reagin (RPR) and fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test, is appropriate for diagnosing syphilis, but there is no indication of this condition in the patient's symptoms or laboratory results.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of bilateral periorbital pain and swelling, diplopia, and proptosis, along with the findings of bilateral lateral rectus muscle enlargement and mild enlargement of the left medial rectus muscle on orbital computed tomography, suggest an orbital inflammatory condition. The absence of any constitutional, dermatologic, or neurologic symptoms and the lack of any signs of optic neuropathy also support this diagnosis. The patient's history of Crohn disease and recent change in medication from infliximab to ustekinumab suggest that the orbital inflammation may be related to the patient's underlying autoimmune disorder. Performing further imaging to exclude a solid-organ primary malignancy, such as a lymphoma or sarcoma, would be the next appropriate step in the patient's management. This would help to determine if the patient's symptoms are related to a systemic malignancy or if they are isolated to the orbit. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's history of bilateral multifocal macular lesions, with a pseudohypopyon appearance on fluorescein angiography and hyperreflectance on OCT, suggests a diagnosis of acute exudative polymorphous vitelliform maculopathy (AEPVM). The idiopathic variant of AEPVM is more common in middle-aged women, and the presence of multiple lesions increases the likelihood of this diagnosis. The patient's lack of significant medical history, including no family history of retinal diseases, and the absence of any evidence of a choroidal neovascular membrane on examination or imaging, also support this diagnosis. Genetic testing (option C) would be the next appropriate step to confirm the diagnosis, as AEPVM has been associated with genetic mutations in several genes, including the ELOVL4 gene. Repeat anti-VEGF treatment (option B) may be considered if the patient's symptoms persist or worsen, but it is not the most appropriate next step given the patient's history and examination findings. A computed tomographic scan of chest, abdomen, and pelvis (option A) is not necessary at this time, as there is no evidence to suggest a systemic malignancy or other condition that would be detected by this imaging modality. Antiretinal antibody testing (option D) may be considered in the future if the patient's condition does not respond to treatment or if there is a suspicion of an autoimmune component to the disease.

Answer: D: Perform a clear lens exchange in the left eye
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of worsening angle closure, flickering photopsias, and temporal scotoma, along with the physical findings of shallow anterior chamber, open angle, and choroidal detachments, suggest that the laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) performed in the left eye has not effectively resolved the issue. The patient's age and lack of other systemic or ocular conditions suggest that a clear lens exchange (CLE) may be an appropriate intervention to address the angle closure and prevent further vision loss. CLE involves removing the natural crystalline lens and replacing it with an intraocular lens, which can help to deepen the anterior chamber and reduce the risk of further angle closure. Repeat LPI (Option A) may not be effective in this case, as the initial LPI did not resolve the issue. Performing LPI in the right eye (Option B) is not indicated, as there is no evidence of angle closure in that eye. Sclerectomy (Option C) may be considered in some cases of angle closure, but it is not the most appropriate option in this case, as the patient has open angles and the main issue is the shallow anterior chamber and choroidal detachments.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination findings, including rapid, painless vision loss, multilobulated, serous retinal detachment, and choroidal thickening, are consistent with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome. The presence of marked lymphadenopathy throughout the mediastinum and diffuse scleral thickening in both eyes on computed tomographic scan also supports this diagnosis. Performing a ciliary body–choroidal biopsy in the right eye (option C) would provide a definitive diagnosis and guide further management. Injecting intravitreal antibiotics for endophthalmitis (option B) would not be appropriate as there is no evidence of infection, and treating the patient with systemic steroids for presumed VKH syndrome (option D) may be considered after a definitive diagnosis has been made. A diagnostic vitrectomy in the right eye (option A) may also be considered, but biopsy is a more targeted approach to establish the diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of bilateral linear oral ulcerations and facial swelling, along with the histopathological findings of noncaseating granulomatous inflammation, are consistent with Sjogren disease. Sjogren disease is an autoimmune disorder that affects the exocrine glands, including the salivary glands, and can cause oral ulcerations and facial swelling. The patient's history of depression and prior alcohol use disorder may also be relevant to the patient's overall health and potential treatment plan, but they are not directly related to the likely diagnosis of Sjogren disease.

The other options are less likely:

A: Mumps (epidemic parotitis) is an acute viral infection that can cause swelling of the salivary glands, but it typically does not cause bilateral linear oral ulcerations or facial swelling.

B: Alcoholic sialosis is a condition that can cause inflammation and damage to the salivary glands, but it is typically associated with chronic alcohol consumption, and the patient has been sober for 3 years.

D: Crohn disease is an inflammatory bowel disease that can affect various parts of the gastrointestinal tract, but it is not typically associated with oral ulcerations or facial swelling.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of hoarseness and intermittent dry cough, along with the physical examination findings of left vocal cord palsy, suggest a possible diagnosis of laryngeal cancer. However, the presence of an ill-defined soft tissue mass in the left supraclavicular region, which is likely nodal disease, and the involvement of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve, suggest a possible metastatic disease. The patient's history of no smoking or significant medical history reduces the likelihood of laryngeal cancer. Moreover, the patient's age of 64 years is not typical for laryngeal cancer. Therefore, option B, metastatic colon cancer, is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The clinical presentation of the patient, with multiple small erythematous to hyperpigmented papules on the face, trunk, and extremities, and symmetric annular brown erythematous plaques on the cheeks and temples, is consistent with palisaded neutrophilic and granulomatous dermatitis (PNGD). The laboratory findings of hypocomplementemia and proteinuria also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the biopsy results show a dense infiltrate of neutrophils and granulomas, which are characteristic features of PNGD.

The other options do not fit the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings. Nonbullous neutrophilic lupus erythematosus (Option A) typically presents with larger, more painful lesions and does not have the characteristic symmetric annular brown erythematous plaques on the cheeks and temples. Histiocytoid Sweet syndrome (Option B) is a rare condition that is characterized by the sudden onset of fever, arthralgia, and a severe, widespread, and painful skin eruption, and is not associated with hypocomplementemia or proteinuria. Hypocomplementemic urticaria vasculitis (Option D) is a rare condition that is characterized by recurrent episodes of urticaria and angioedema, and is not associated with the skin findings or laboratory results described in the case.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's hemodynamic instability and development of severe mitral regurgitation (MR) suggest that the pVAD support may not be sufficient to manage the patient's cardiac failure. The patient's condition warrants urgent surgical intervention to address the MR, which is likely caused by myocardial dysfunction and/or annular dilatation. Consulting cardiovascular surgery to discuss mitral valve surgery is the most appropriate next step. This will allow for a thorough evaluation of the patient's condition and determination of the best course of action for definitive treatment. While transcatheter mitral valve repair may be a viable option in some cases, it may not be suitable for this patient given the severity of the MR and the need for urgent surgical intervention. Vasodilators may be useful in reducing afterload and improving cardiac output, but they are not a substitute for definitive surgical treatment. Removing the pVAD at bedside without proper evaluation and treatment may put the patient at risk for further hemodynamic instability and adverse outcomes.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and findings, including blurred vision, subretinal fluid, and cystoid spaces in the outer and inner nuclear layers, suggest the possibility of a neovascular membrane or choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Fluorescein angiography would be the appropriate next step to confirm the presence of CNV and guide treatment with photodynamic therapy or anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy. Intravitreal anti-VEGF (Option A) may be considered after confirmation of CNV by fluorescein angiography. OCT of the optic nerve head (Option C) may also be useful in assessing the severity of the disease, but it is not the most appropriate next step. OCT-angiography of the macula (Option D) is a newer imaging technique that can provide detailed information on retinal blood vessels, but it is not yet widely available and may not be necessary at this stage of the patient's evaluation.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with bilateral hemorrhagic optic disc edema, which can be caused by various conditions such as diabetic retinopathy, hypertensive retinopathy, and retinal vein occlusion. However, the presence of multiple flame hemorrhages surrounding the optic nerve and the history of intravenous drug abuse suggest a possible diagnosis of endogenous endophthalmitis. Endogenous endophthalmitis is a severe intraocular infection that can cause rapid vision loss and is a medical emergency. Intravitreal foscarnet is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent that is effective against bacterial, fungal, and viral infections and is commonly used to treat endogenous endophthalmitis. Therefore, the next step would be to inject intravitreal foscarnet to treat the possible endophthalmitis. Obtaining HIV and syphilis serology results (option A) may also be considered, but it is not the most urgent step in managing the patient's current condition. Administering 1000 mg of intravenous methylprednisolone (option B) may be considered for its anti-inflammatory effects, but it is not the most appropriate step in this case. Obtaining a computed tomographic scan of the brain (option D) may be necessary to rule out other causes of vision loss, but it is not the most urgent step in managing the patient's current condition.

Answer: C: Repeat aqueous or vitreous sampling.
Explanation: The patient's worsening eye pain and the development of a dense cataract with retrolenticular plaque suggest that the current treatment is not effectively managing the underlying condition. Repeating aqueous or vitreous sampling can help to identify any persistent or new infectious agents that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. This information can guide further treatment decisions, such as adjusting the antibiotic regimen or considering alternative diagnoses.

Option A, starting topical and systemic steroids, may not be the most appropriate next step as the patient's symptoms are primarily due to the infectious process, and steroids may not effectively address the underlying infection.

Option B, switching to intravenous meropenem, may be considered, but it is important to first confirm the efficacy of the current antibiotics and to rule out any other potential causes of the patient's symptoms before changing the antibiotic regimen.

Option D, observing the patient while receiving current therapy, may not be the most appropriate option as the patient's symptoms are worsening, and a more active approach is needed to address the patient's declining vision and eye pain.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of a fluctuating right parotid mass that has been present for 3 years, along with the presence of associated lymphadenopathy, suggest a chronic infection. The patient's history of receiving multiple rounds of antibiotics from other healthcare professionals also supports this diagnosis. The fact that the patient had an isolated right 2-cm fluctuant and tender mass overlying the parotid gland, with no accompanying cervical lymphadenopathy, and normal complete blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate levels, makes chronic sialadenitis with abscess the most likely diagnosis. Additionally, the imaging findings of a 1.9-cm peripherally enhancing, centrally necrotic lesion overlying the superficial right parotid gland with multiple subcentimeter necrotic lymph nodes within the right parotid gland, are consistent with chronic sialadenitis with abscess. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Chronic sialadenitis with abscess.

The patient's symptom of subtle tightness sensation on the arm when abducted to 90° also supports this diagnosis. Intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia (option A) is a benign condition that typically occurs in the setting of chronic venous insufficiency and is not associated with melanoma. Axillary web syndrome (option C) is a condition that occurs when the lymphatic vessels in the axilla become damaged or blocked, leading to swelling and pain in the arm, and is not related to melanoma.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of bilateral upper eyelid ecchymosis and edema, as well as a mass on the right temporal area, are concerning for a possible bleeding disorder. However, the patient's history of hitting his head on a table 1 month before symptoms developed suggests that the bleeding may be related to a head injury rather than a bleeding disorder. Additionally, the patient's pupils were equal and reactive to light, and there was no afferent pupillary defect, which suggests that there is no damage to the optic nerve. Given these findings, it would be appropriate to treat the patient with cool compresses and artificial tears, and to reassure the parents that the symptoms are likely related to the head injury and will resolve on their own.

The patient's symptoms of blurred vision, elevated choroidal lesion, and shallow subretinal fluid, along with the findings of hypofluorescence on indocyanine green angiography and hyperintensity on T1-weighted MRI, suggest a possible diagnosis of a choroidal melanoma. The patient's recent development of gingivitis and unresponsiveness to intravenous antibiotics further supports this diagnosis. While plaque radiotherapy (option A) and oral corticosteroids (option B) may be considered for the management of choroidal melanoma, enucleation is the most appropriate next step in this case given the size and location of the lesion, as well as the patient's symptoms and recent development of gingivitis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, mild cognitive impairment, poor coordination, and muscle weakness of the bilateral lower limbs, along with the echocardiogram results of diffuse hypertrophy, moderately decreased contractility of the left ventricle, and increased intramyocardial signal intensity, suggest the possibility of a genetic disorder affecting the patient's cardiac and nervous systems. The patient's history of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss and cerebellar atrophy on brain magnetic resonance imaging also support this possibility.

The titin gene is a likely candidate for genetic testing given the patient's symptoms and echocardiogram results. Titin is a critical protein in the structure and function of the cardiac myofibers, and mutations in the titin gene have been associated with various cardiac and neurological disorders, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and sensorineural hearing loss. Sequencing of the titin gene may help identify a potential genetic cause for the patient's condition and guide further management and counseling.

In contrast, sequencing of the myosin heavy chain gene, dystrophin gene, or mitochondrial DNA may not be as relevant to the patient's symptoms and echocardiogram results, although they may also be considered in the context of a broader genetic evaluation.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient presents with a near-total retinal detachment and a large, white, preretinal lesion in the inferior macula, which suggests a possible infectious etiology. The history of recent travel and illness, along with the presence of vitritis and snow banking, further supports this suspicion. Performing a pars plana vitrectomy for retinal detachment repair would allow for a thorough evaluation of the retina and vitreous cavity, including the removal of any inflammatory or infectious material, and would also provide a sample for cultures and polymerase chain reaction. Injecting intravitreal vancomycin and ceftazidime (Option A) may be appropriate, but it would not provide a definitive diagnosis or allow for the removal of any inflammatory or infectious material. Obtaining an aqueous sample for cultures and polymerase chain reaction (Option B) may be useful in diagnosing an infectious etiology, but it would not provide a definitive diagnosis or allow for the removal of any inflammatory or infectious material. Beginning oral prednisone (Option D) would not be appropriate at this time, as it would not address the underlying cause of the retinal detachment.

The punch biopsy results showing intrafollicular and subcorneal pustule formation are also consistent with actinic folliculitis. Papulopustular rosacea (option A) typically presents with more widespread and persistent erythema, and pinpoint papular light eruption (option B) is less likely given the patient's history of recurrent pustular eruptions.

Answer: C
Explanation: The isolated reduced diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (Dlco) likely reflects an alveolar-capillary gas transfer abnormality. In this case, the patient's Dlco is reduced, indicating that there is a problem with the transfer of gas from the alveoli to the blood. This could be due to a number of factors, such as a decrease in the number of functional alveoli, an increase in the distance between the alveoli and the capillaries, or a decrease in the permeability of the alveolar-capillary membrane. The fact that the forced vital capacity and forced expiratory volume are normal suggests that the problem is not with the airways, but rather with the gas exchange process. The patient's history of exertional dyspnea also supports this diagnosis, as it suggests that the patient is having trouble getting enough oxygen to the tissues during physical activity. The hemoglobin level, while slightly elevated, is not likely to be the primary cause of the reduced Dlco in this case.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's history of travel to northeastern Brazil, along with the presence of eosinophils in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the absence of meningeal signs, suggests a diagnosis of neuroschistosomiasis. Neuroschistosomiasis is a parasitic infection caused by Schistosoma larvae that migrate to the central nervous system, leading to inflammation and damage to the brain and spinal cord. The patient's symptoms of headache, dysarthria, double vision, and dizziness are consistent with this diagnosis. The laboratory test results, including the elevated eosinophil count and normal liver and kidney function, also support this diagnosis. The patient's chest computed tomography findings of bilateral patchy pulmonary infiltrates may represent a concurrent pulmonary schistosomiasis infection. Listeriosis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder can also present with similar symptoms, but the patient's history and laboratory results make neuroschistosomiasis the most likely diagnosis.

Explanation: The patient's recent COVID-19 vaccination may have caused the enlarged and abnormal-appearing axillary lymph nodes, which could be a temporary and benign effect of the vaccine. It is important to note that the patient did not have palpable axillary lymphadenopathy before receiving the vaccine. Therefore, option C, performing an axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy at the time of lumpectomy, may not be necessary at this time and may be considered a premature action. Instead, option A, repeating the breast MRI 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination, would allow for further evaluation of the breast lesion and assessment of any potential changes in the axillary lymph nodes after the vaccine has had time to clear the patient's system. If the lymph nodes remain enlarged or show suspicious features, then an axillary ultrasound (option B) or biopsy (option D) could be considered.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of severe polyarthralgia and swelling of bilateral fingers and toes, along with the elevated alkaline phosphatase level and corrected calcium level, suggest a diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism. The patient's history of tertiary hyperparathyroidism related to end-stage kidney disease and the recent kidney transplant suggest that the hyperparathyroidism is likely caused by an overactive parathyroid gland. The patient's medications, including tacrolimus and prednisolone, may also contribute to the development of hyperparathyroidism.

 option A, obtaining a positron emission computed tomography scan, may be useful in evaluating the parathyroid glands and detecting any abnormalities, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management.

 option B, performing a bone biopsy, may be necessary if the diagnosis of hyperparathyroidism is uncertain or if there are signs of bone disease, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management at this time.

 option D, stopping voriconazole, may be necessary if the patient is experiencing adverse effects or if the medication is not effective in managing the patient's fungal infection, but it is not relevant to the patient's current symptoms and diagnosis.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in management would be to schedule parathyroidectomy, which is option C. This surgical procedure can help to treat the hyperparathyroidism and alleviate the patient's symptoms.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of blurry vision, floaters, and headache, along with the physical examination findings of peripapillary intraretinal and preretinal hemorrhages, suggest a possible diagnosis of radiation retinopathy. This is a common complication of radiation therapy to the head and neck, and it can cause significant visual impairment if left untreated. Given the patient's history of CML and previous exposure to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, it is likely that the hemorrhages are a result of radiation therapy rather than a primary ocular condition. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to refer the patient to radiation oncology for further evaluation and management of radiation retinopathy. Bilateral intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor injections (Option A) may be considered for macular edema or neovascularization, but they are not the most appropriate next step in this case. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits (Option C) may be considered to rule out other causes of blurry vision, but it is not as urgent as the radiation therapy. Observation and reassurance (Option D) would not be appropriate given the severity of the patient's symptoms and the potential for significant visual loss.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of blurred vision, polydipsia, and headache, along with the abnormal T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensity in the left occipital cortex on MRI, suggest the possibility of a demyelinating disorder such as multiple sclerosis. A lumbar puncture would be appropriate to assess cerebrospinal fluid contents and help support this diagnosis. Measuring C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (Option A) may also be useful in assessing inflammation, but it is not as directly relevant to the patient's symptoms as a lumbar puncture. Measuring blood glucose levels (Option B) is not relevant to the patient's symptoms or potential diagnosis. Performing magnetic resonance angiography of the head (Option D) may be considered later in the diagnostic workup, but it is not the most appropriate next step given the patient's symptoms and MRI findings.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a possible benign or malignant tumor in the lateral canthus of her right eye. The lesion's gradual growth over 2 months and tenderness to palpation suggest that it may be a tumor, rather than a cyst or inflammatory lesion. The absence of overlying erythema, warmth, telangiectasia, or ulceration makes it less likely to be an infectious process. The patient's age and lack of significant medical or ocular history also increase the likelihood of a tumor. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to perform an excisional biopsy of the lesion to rule out malignancy. This will allow for a tissue diagnosis and guide further management. Conservative management with warm compresses and eyelid massage may be appropriate for some benign lesions, but it is not a definitive diagnostic or therapeutic approach. Observation without further intervention may also be appropriate for some benign lesions, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Incision and drainage of the lesion is not appropriate as it is not a fluid-filled lesion.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and MRI findings are consistent with an optic nerve glioma. The patient's vision has progressed to no light perception in the right eye, indicating a more aggressive tumor. Given the patient's young age and the rapid progression of the tumor, it is important to consider early surgical intervention to attempt to preserve vision. Transcranial resection of the orbital, canalicular, and prechiasmal optic nerve (option B) would allow for removal of the tumor and potentially preserve some vision. While chemotherapy and/or radiation (option C) may also be considered, surgical resection is a more immediate and direct approach to address the tumor. Observation (option D) would not be appropriate given the rapid progression of the tumor and the potential for further vision loss. Transorbital biopsy (option A) may be considered to confirm the diagnosis, but it would not address the tumor itself and may not be necessary given the patient's symptoms and MRI findings.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as the arc-shaped depressed skin groove on the forehead and frontal scalp, localized linear hair loss and hair thinning on the left scalp area, and the histopathological findings of lymphocytic infiltrates in perifollicular and periappendageal regions of the dermis and lobular panniculitis, are consistent with linear or annular lupus erythematosus panniculitis of the scalp. Additionally, the patient's history of intralesional steroid injection on a small bald patch on the vertex, which led to the gradual progression of the lesion to the frontal scalp and forehead, further supports this diagnosis. Linear atrophoderma of Moulin (option A) is a rare condition characterized by linear depressed scars on the scalp, but it does not involve hair loss or inflammation. Linear discoid lupus erythematosus (option B) typically presents with discoid lesions on the scalp, but the presence of an arc-shaped furrow and the histopathological findings of lymphocytic infiltrates and lobular panniculitis are not consistent with this diagnosis. Localized lipodystrophy (option D) is a condition characterized by the loss of subcutaneous fat tissue in a localized area, but it does not present with the same clinical and histopathological features as seen in this case.

TAMA is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome associated with thymoma, which can cause a variety of autoimmune diseases, including lichenoid lesions. The patient's history of recurrent respiratory infections and diarrhea also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's negative IIF and immunoblot results suggest that the autoimmune response is not directed against desmosomal or basement membrane antigens, which is consistent with TAMA. Therefore, option B is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of palpitations and chest pain, along with the T wave inversions on the electrocardiogram, suggest the possibility of a coronary artery anomaly or blockage. A catheterization on the left side of the heart and coronary angiogram would be the next appropriate step to evaluate the coronary arteries and determine the cause of the patient's symptoms. This test would allow for visualization of the coronary arteries and identification of any blockages or stenosis. While a dobutamine stress echocardiogram (option B) may also be useful in evaluating the heart's function and identifying any areas of ischemia, it would not provide the same level of detail as a coronary angiogram in diagnosing a coronary artery anomaly or blockage. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (option C) may also be useful in evaluating the heart's structure and function, but it would not provide the same level of detail as a coronary angiogram in diagnosing a coronary artery anomaly or blockage.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and findings are consistent with scleromyxoedema, a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by the deposition of mucin in the skin and various organs, including the nervous system. The patient's skin papules, which are hypopigmented with central hyperpigmented umbilication, and larger papules with typical central atrophic porcelain white scarring, are consistent with the skin manifestations of scleromyxoedema. Additionally, the patient's acute myelopathy and ascending numbness are consistent with the neurological manifestations of the disorder. The absence of other causes of myelopathy, such as malignancy or infection, and the presence of elevated protein in the cerebrospinal fluid, support the diagnosis of scleromyxoedema. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis (IM), which is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The negative rapid strep test and throat culture results suggest that the patient does not have a group A streptococcal infection. The patient's history of no fevers, chills, trismus, headache, dyspnea, chest pain, abdominal pain, fatigue, or rash also supports this diagnosis, as these symptoms are not typically seen in group A streptococcal infections. Azithromycin is not effective against EBV, and an oral antifungal medication is not indicated for this diagnosis. Therefore, option B, prescribing azithromycin, is the best choice.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of sudden-onset bilateral horizontal diplopia, left-sided upper eyelid ptosis, and drooling when eating, along with the physical examination findings of incomitant esotropia, left pupillary abnormalities, and decreased corneal sensation on the left, suggest a possible diagnosis of a cranial nerve disorder. Specifically, the combination of diplopia, ptosis, and pupillary abnormalities suggests a possible third cranial nerve palsy. Additionally, the patient's history of trigeminal neuralgia and recent normal CT scan of the brain suggest that the cause of the palsy is unlikely to be a vascular event or a mass lesion.

Therefore, the next step in the diagnostic workup would be to obtain an MRI of the brain with contrast to further evaluate the cranial nerves and rule out any other intracranial causes of the palsy. This is the most appropriate choice among the options provided, as it is a non-invasive and sensitive test that can provide valuable information about the structural integrity of the cranial nerves and the brain.

The other options do not address the likely diagnosis of a cranial nerve disorder and are therefore less appropriate at this stage of the diagnostic workup. CT angiography of the head and neck (option A) may be useful in evaluating the blood vessels of the brain, but it is not the most appropriate test for evaluating cranial nerve function. Lumbar puncture to analyze cellular composition of cerebrospinal fluid (option B) may be useful in evaluating for inflammatory or infectious conditions, but it is not the most appropriate test for evaluating cranial nerve function. Ordering tests of inflammatory markers (option D) may be useful in evaluating for inflammatory conditions, but it is not the most appropriate test for evaluating cranial nerve function.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of bilateral eye redness and pain, along with the physical examination findings of diffuse scleral injection that does not blanch after administration of phenylephrine, suggest a possible diagnosis of scleritis. Scleritis is a type of ocular inflammation that affects the sclera and can be caused by various factors, including infection, autoimmune disorders, and trauma. Given the patient's history of unprotected sexual contact with multiple male partners, there is a possibility of a sexually transmitted infection (STI) or a viral infection. Therefore, it would be appropriate to perform laboratory work-up for infectious and autoimmune diseases to determine the underlying cause of the scleritis. This would include tests such as a complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and viral load to rule out any underlying infection or inflammatory condition. Additionally, the patient's history of dry eye disease and use of preservative-free artificial tears may also need to be taken into consideration when interpreting the test results. Once the underlying cause is identified, appropriate treatment can be initiated. Oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Option A) and oral corticosteroids (Option B) may be used to manage the symptoms of scleritis, but they would not address the underlying cause of the condition. Topical corticosteroids (Option D) may also be used to manage the symptoms, but they would not be effective in treating the underlying cause of the scleritis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient has a history of pseudoexfoliation syndrome and glaucomatous optic neuropathy in the right eye, and has recently undergone trabeculectomy with mitomycin C. She has also been treated for pulmonary Mycobacterium avium infection secondary to hypogammaglobulinemia. Given this history, it is likely that the patient's current symptoms of decreased vision and conjunctival hyperemia in the left eye are related to an infectious process, rather than a sterile inflammation. The presence of a small hypopyon in the left eye supports this diagnosis.

Therefore, the best course of action would be to review and adjust the patient's systemic medications, and treat with topical corticosteroids to control the inflammation. Pars plana vitrectomy with intravitreal antibiotics, as option A, may be necessary if the patient's condition does not improve with medical management, but it is not the most appropriate first step. Treatment with topical and oral antibiotics, as option B, may also be necessary, but it is not as targeted as topical corticosteroids and may not address the underlying inflammation. Treatment with systemic and topical corticosteroids, as option D, may be considered, but the risk of steroid-induced glaucoma and cataract formation should be taken into account, especially in a patient with a history of glaucoma.

Explanation: Calciphylaxis is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition that is characterized by the deposition of calcium in the walls of blood vessels, leading to thrombosis and skin necrosis. The patient's symptoms of painful eruptions on the bilateral lower extremities, rapid progression with skin necrosis, and elevated phosphorus level are consistent with calciphylaxis. The patient's history of cholangiocarcinoma and treatment with pemigatinib, a fibroblast growth factor receptor inhibitor, increases the likelihood of this diagnosis. The presence of calcium deposits within the wall of a blood vessel in the subcutaneous tissue and pseudoxanthoma elasticum–like changes with fragmented calcified elastic fibers in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue, as seen in the punch biopsy specimen, further support this diagnosis. Therefore, option B (calciphylaxis) is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: A. Kaposi sarcoma.
Explanation: Kaposi sarcoma is a vascular neoplasm that typically presents with violaceous plaques or nodules on the skin, often on the lower extremities. The patient's history of large, purple plaques on the left lower extremity that have been present for years and have been enlarging and darkening over the past 5 years, along with the absence of symptoms such as pruritus, bleeding, or pain, are consistent with the clinical presentation of Kaposi sarcoma. The patient's age and lack of risk factors for other conditions such as hypertension, atherosclerotic disease, or HIV also support this diagnosis. The histopathologic findings of proliferation of superficial and deep vessels, with thickening of the endothelium, are also consistent with Kaposi sarcoma. Therefore, option A is the most likely diagnosis.

Option B, Stewart-Bluefarb syndrome, is a rare condition characterized by the association of angiofibroma and multiple keratoacanthomas. It is unlikely to present with the violaceous plaques and nodules described in the patient's history.

Option C, Acroangiodermatitis of Mali, is a rare condition characterized by violaceous plaques on the skin, often on the hands and feet. However, it is typically associated with systemic symptoms such as fever, fatigue, and weight loss, which are not mentioned in the patient's history.

Option D, Lichen planus, is an inflammatory skin condition that can present with violaceous plaques, but it typically has a different clinical appearance and is associated with symptoms such as itching and burning.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as episodic breathlessness, cough, and wheezing with expectoration of brownish sputum, suggest a respiratory infection. The physical examination findings of a depressed plaque and multiple nodules on the cheek, as well as the results of the punch biopsy, are consistent with a diagnosis of phaeohyphomycosis. The histopathological and microbiological examination results, which showed inflammatory infiltrate composed of giant cells in the deeper dermis extending into the subcutaneous fat, epithelioid cell granulomas, and fungal profiles within giant cells, support this diagnosis. Additionally, the periodic acid-Schiff stain highlighting septate fungal hyphae with acute-angled branching within giant cells further confirms the diagnosis of phaeohyphomycosis. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, and presyncope, along with the echocardiography findings of a large echogenic mass on the inferior aspect of the interatrial septum, suggest a cardiac tumor that may be obstructing the left ventricular outflow tract. This could potentially cause cardiac failure and other complications. Given the patient's history of Burkitt lymphoma, it is likely that the mass is a metastasis. Therefore, urgent surgical resection of the intracardiac mass (option B) would be the most appropriate next step in management. Thoracoscopic biopsy of the hilar mass (option A) may also be considered, but given the patient's symptoms and history, it is more urgent to address the intracardiac mass. Referring to an oncologist for further chemotherapy (option C) may also be necessary, but surgical resection should be the first step. An endomyocardial biopsy (option D) would not be appropriate in this case, as it would not provide adequate tissue for diagnosis and would not address the potential obstruction caused by the mass.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of back pain, fever, and cough, along with the imaging findings of a dense consolidation in the left lower lobe and a paraspinal soft tissue mass with spinal cord compression, suggest the possibility of a pulmonary infection with possible spinal involvement. The patient's history of travel to India and recent onset of symptoms suggest the possibility of tuberculosis. The patient's work as a software engineer and lack of smoking history, recent animal contact, or unpasteurized animal product ingestion make it less likely that the symptoms are related to a non-infectious condition. Therefore, placing the patient in airborne isolation and starting anti-tuberculosis treatment with ethambutol, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and rifampin is the most appropriate next step. Measuring prostate-specific antigen level (option B) may be relevant for a different diagnosis, but is not directly related to the patient's current symptoms. Starting cefepime and vancomycin (option C) may be appropriate for a bacterial infection, but is not targeted towards tuberculosis. Starting doxycycline, rifampin, and streptomycin (option D) may be appropriate for some cases of tuberculosis, but the addition of streptomycin may not be necessary in this case and may increase the risk of adverse effects.

Answer: B
Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of progressive lower extremity pain and gait imbalance, along with the physical examination findings of reduced pinprick sensation, absent vibratory sensation, and mild weakness of ankle dorsiflexion, are consistent with a diagnosis of polyneuropathy. The nerve conduction studies (NCS) and needle electromyography (EMG) results support this diagnosis.

The NCS results show prolonged distal latencies and slow conduction velocities, which are consistent with a demyelinating polyneuropathy. Demyelination is the loss of the myelin sheath surrounding the nerve fibers, which can cause slowing of nerve impulse conduction. The EMG results show no evidence of muscle disease or abnormal spontaneous activity, which supports the diagnosis of polyneuropathy rather than other conditions such as muscle disease or radiculopathy.

Therefore, the correct answer is B: Results are consistent with demyelinating polyneuropathy.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's blue pigmentation of the skin, sclera, and teeth is suggestive of argyria, a condition caused by the ingestion of excessive amounts of silver or silver salts. The patient's history of taking minocycline, which contains silver, suggests that this may be the cause of his argyria. Therefore, the next step would be to order serum iron studies to assess the patient's iron status and determine if the argyria is caused by excessive silver ingestion. Choice C is the correct answer.

Choices A and D are incorrect because discontinuing apixaban or ordering serum niacin levels would not help in diagnosing or managing the patient's argyria. Choice B, discontinuing minocycline, may be appropriate, but it is not the next step in managing the patient's condition.

Answer: A
Explanation: Pars plana vitrectomy would be the next step in managing this patient's condition. The patient presents with new-onset macular schisis in the left eye, which is a retinal condition characterized by a split in the outer plexiform and outer nuclear layers of the retina. This condition is often associated with glaucoma, as in this patient's case. The schisis-like separation observed on OCT imaging extends from the temporal edge of the optic nerve head to the fovea, which suggests that the condition is affecting the macula and potentially threatening the patient's central vision.

Pars plana vitrectomy is a surgical procedure that involves removing the vitreous gel and any associated membranes that may be contributing to the schisis. This procedure can help to relieve traction on the retina and prevent further progression of the condition, potentially improving the patient's vision.

While laser barricade (option B) may be considered in some cases of macular schisis, it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's management. Observation (option C) may be considered for patients with mild or stable disease, but given the patient's symptoms and findings on OCT imaging, a more active approach is warranted. Genetic testing for the RS1 gene (option D) is not directly related to the patient's current condition and would not impact the immediate management of her macular schisis.

Explanation: The patient's history of hereditary bilateral retinoblastoma and previous treatment with radiation therapy increases her risk of developing a soft tissue sarcoma, such as angiosarcoma. The patient's symptoms of unilateral leg swelling and the findings on Doppler ultrasonography and computed tomography venogram are consistent with a vascular tumor, such as angiosarcoma. Angiosarcoma is a rare and aggressive type of cancer that arises from the endothelial cells lining blood vessels. It typically affects the soft tissues of the body, such as the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and muscles, and can infiltrate or compress surrounding structures. The patient's age and medical history make angiosarcoma a more likely diagnosis than leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, or hemangioendothelioma. Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C: Angiosarcoma.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of a compressive neck mass with dyspnea while supine, along with the location of the mass lateral to the right thyroid gland, suggest a parathyroid cyst. The elevated PTH level in the fine-needle aspirate further supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the absence of any cutaneous or sinus tract changes and the lack of enhancement on the contrast-enhanced CT scan suggest that the lesion is not a branchial cleft cyst or a thyroglossal duct cyst. A cystic thyroid nodule is also unlikely given the location and size of the mass. Therefore, option C, parathyroid cyst, is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's history of recently treated mixed nonseminomatous germ cell tumor (NSGCT) of the right testicle with metastasis to the retroperitoneal and mediastinal lymph nodes, followed by a reduction in metastatic tumor burden and normalization of α-fetoprotein and β-human chorionic gonadotropin after chemotherapy, suggests that the rapidly enlarging neck mass is likely a case of growing teratoma syndrome (GTS). GTS is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of NSGCT that occurs when the teratoma component of the primary tumor or metastasis grows rapidly after chemotherapy. The patient's neck swelling, which initially decreased in size while undergoing chemotherapy, progressively enlarged shortly after concluding treatment, which further supports this diagnosis. The imaging findings of a clearly defined, bulky supraclavicular mass confined to left neck levels 3, 4, and 5, with extensive septations and modularity within the mass, are also consistent with GTS. Therefore, option C (Growing teratoma syndrome) is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive hoarseness and dyspnea, along with the physical examination findings of a right vocal fold neoplasm and bilateral vocal fold motion impairment, are consistent with a diagnosis of extramedullary myeloid sarcoma (EMS) of the larynx. EMS is a rare complication of allogeneic stem cell transplantation, and it typically affects the skin, subcutaneous tissue, or lymph nodes. However, in this case, the involvement of the larynx is unusual and suggests EMS. The histologic findings of a diffuse infiltrate of large cells with irregular nuclear contours, vesicular chromatin, and prominent nucleoli, along with the immunohistochemical stains showing CD33, CD43, and CD117 positivity, are consistent with EMS. The negative stains for CD3, CD20, and cytokeratin expression help to rule out other potential diagnoses such as squamous cell carcinoma, lymphoma, or graft-vs-host disease. Therefore, answer C is the correct diagnosis.

Answer: B 
Explanation: The patient's history of NK/T-cell lymphoma, the presence of widespread erythematous patches and thin plaques with prominent telangiectases, and the negative results for viral and fungal infections suggest that the skin eruption is related to the patient's malignancy. Intravascular involvement by NK/T-cell lymphoma is a rare but known complication of this type of cancer, and it can present with skin lesions similar to those described in the case. The patient's recent discontinuation of pembrolizumab, which can cause a morbilliform reaction, may have contributed to the development of this complication. The other options, including malignant neoplasm–associated microscopic polyangiitis, cutaneous coccidiomycosis, and erythema nodosum, are less likely given the patient's history and clinical presentation.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's worsening cardiomyopathy and acute kidney injury suggest that the current pacing configuration may not be optimal. The patient has a history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy with a depressed ejection fraction, which has worsened despite biventricular pacing. Additionally, the patient has idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, which may be contributing to the worsening cardiomyopathy. Changing the LV pacing configuration may help to improve the patient's cardiac function and reduce the risk of further decline in his condition.

Option A, suppressing premature ventricular contractions, may not address the underlying cause of the worsening cardiomyopathy and may not improve the patient's symptoms.

Option B, increasing the basal pacing rate, may not be appropriate given the patient's history of nonischemic cardiomyopathy and depressed ejection fraction. Increasing the pacing rate may put additional strain on the heart and exacerbate the patient's condition.

Option D, referring for LV lead repositioning, may not be necessary at this time, as the patient's symptoms and recent changes in QRS morphology suggest that a change in pacing configuration may be more appropriate.

Therefore, the best answer is C, changing the LV pacing configuration, as it may help to improve the patient's cardiac function and reduce the risk of further decline in his condition.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of multiple progressive ulcers on the right side of his face, burning sensation, and hypoesthesia of the right side of the face, as well as the radiological findings of an extensive ischemic posterior circulation stroke involving the right occipital lobe, lower cerebellar peduncle, and pontomedullary boundary, are consistent with trigeminal trophic syndrome. This is a rare condition that occurs in patients with a history of stroke or other brain injury, and is characterized by painful ulcers on the face, usually on the side opposite to the affected brain hemisphere. The patient's history of unstable angina and coronary angiography, followed by the development of left-sided hemiplegia and hemianopsia, suggests that the stroke occurred recently. The absence of headache, shoulder, or jaw pain and visual disturbance also supports the diagnosis of trigeminal trophic syndrome. Giant cell arteritis (option A) is a possibility, but the patient's age and the absence of symptoms such as headache, fever, and temporal artery tenderness make it less likely. Trigeminal herpes zoster (option B) is also a possibility, but the patient's history of stroke and the absence of other symptoms such as facial weakness or paralysis, as well as the absence of rash or vesicles, make it less likely. Pyoderma gangrenosum (option D) is a rare condition that can cause ulcers on the skin, but it is usually associated with a history of inflammatory bowel disease or other systemic conditions, and the patient's history and physical examination do not suggest this diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of right ptosis and limited eye movements, along with the physical examination findings of orthophoria in primary position and reduced orbicularis oculi strength on both sides, suggest a possible diagnosis of a cranial nerve palsy. The most appropriate next step would be to perform an imaging study to evaluate the cranial nerves, specifically the third cranial nerve which controls elevation of the eyebrow and eyelid, and the sixth cranial nerve which controls abduction of the eye. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits with contrast would be the best choice, as it can provide detailed information about the structure of the cranial nerves and any potential lesions or abnormalities.

Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

Option A, complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein tests, may be useful in identifying any underlying systemic conditions that could be contributing to the patient's symptoms, but it would not provide direct information about the cranial nerves.

Option B, computed tomography or magnetic resonance angiography of the head, may be useful in evaluating the blood vessels of the brain, but it would not provide detailed information about the cranial nerves.

Option D, ice pack test, is not a valid diagnostic test for this patient's symptoms.

Answer: D
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of acute-onset, painless vision loss in one eye, accompanied by tinnitus and severe intermittent headaches, along with the physical examination findings of bilateral optic nerve edema, are concerning for a potential central nervous system disorder. The normal results of the imaging studies and lumbar puncture, along with the elevated protein in the cerebrospinal fluid, suggest that the cause of the symptoms is likely related to an inflammatory or infectious process. The patient's history of hypertensive retinopathy increases the likelihood that the cause of the symptoms is related to a vasculitis or autoimmune disorder. Given the patient's symptoms and examination findings, high-dose corticosteroids may be beneficial in reducing inflammation and preventing further vision loss. Therefore, option C, starting high-dose corticosteroids, is the most appropriate next step in management.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of severe headaches and progressive bilateral vision loss, along with the physical examination findings of bilateral creamy-yellow lesions in the peripheral retina and hypoautofluorescence with surrounding hyperautofluorescence, suggest a possible diagnosis of uveitis. Uveitis is a type of inflammatory eye disease that can cause vision loss if left untreated. The patient's age and lack of medical history also suggest a possible diagnosis of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease, which is a rare autoimmune disorder that can cause uveitis and other systemic symptoms.

Therefore, the best course of action would be to send the patient for infectious and inflammatory tests, such as a complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and antinuclear antibody test, to rule out other potential causes of uveitis and to confirm the diagnosis of VKH disease. Oral prednisone therapy could also be initiated to treat the inflammation and prevent further vision loss, with close follow-up in 1 week to monitor the patient's response to treatment.

Option A, sending for infectious and inflammatory tests and following up within 1 week, is not aggressive enough given the severity of the patient's symptoms and the potential for vision loss. Option C, sending the patient to the emergency department for high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone sodium succinate therapy, may be appropriate for patients with severe uveitis that is unresponsive to oral corticosteroids, but it is not the most appropriate step at this point in the patient's care. Option D, referring for outpatient neurologic evaluation, may be appropriate if the patient's symptoms persist or worsen despite treatment, but it is not the most urgent step in the patient's care at this time.

Explanation: The patient's acute kidney injury and anuric kidney failure, along with the presence of atypical cells in the kidney capillaries, are consistent with acute tubular necrosis secondary to kidney melanoma metastasis. The patient's history of metastatic melanoma and the presence of melanin-A in the kidney capillaries support this diagnosis. The patient's recent treatment with immunotherapy and the rapid progression of disease suggest that the melanoma has spread to the kidneys, leading to acute tubular necrosis. The other options, immune checkpoint inhibitor–induced acute interstitial nephritis, postinfectious glomerulonephritis, and drug-induced acute tubular necrosis, are less likely given the patient's history and clinical presentation.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, as well as the results of the laboratory investigations and imaging studies, are consistent with a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the soft palate. The patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis and type 2 diabetes may also increase the risk of developing SCC. The absence of any systemic symptoms and the presence of a large defect involving the entire soft palate on the left, with smooth and clean edges, are also consistent with SCC. The fact that the patient had biopsies taken from the ulcers and edges of the soft palate defect supports this diagnosis.

The other options are less likely. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (option A) is a malignancy that affects the nasopharynx, but it is rare in the soft palate. Autoimmune vasculitis (option B) is a condition that causes inflammation of the blood vessels, but it does not typically cause ulcers or defects in the soft palate. EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer (option D) is a type of ulcer that is associated with EBV infection, but it is not typically found in the soft palate and does not explain the patient's symptoms or physical examination findings.

The histopathology results showing large round cells proliferating within dermal blood vessels and round cells with scanty cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli filling a vessel also support this diagnosis. IVLBCL typically presents with skin lesions, fever, and elevated inflammatory markers, which are consistent with the patient's symptoms.

Explanation: The patient presents with hypotension, diffuse ST-elevation, and an intracardiac mass. These findings suggest a potential cardiac tamponade, which is a medical emergency requiring immediate attention. Bisoprolol, a beta-blocker, is the most appropriate medication to administer in this scenario, as it can help reduce the heart rate and alleviate the tamponade by decreasing the pressure within the pericardial sac. Dobutamine, a dopamine agonist, may be used to increase cardiac output in certain situations, but it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient's presentation. Nitrates and nifedipine, which are used to treat angina and hypertension, are also not the most appropriate medications for this patient's current condition. Starting an intra-aortic balloon pump may be considered, but it is not the most urgent intervention needed for this patient's cardiac tamponade.

Answer: D
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of painless central scotoma and worsening floaters, along with the physical examination findings of a white macular lesion, disc edema, and scattered intraretinal and peripapillary hemorrhages, are concerning for a possible retinal artery occlusion. The fact that the patient had undergone recent pars plana vitrectomy and had been receiving maintenance obinutuzumab infusions increases the likelihood of this diagnosis.

Retinal artery occlusion is a known complication of vitrectomy, and it can occur due to various factors such as surgical trauma, inflammation, or thrombosis. The use of anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies, such as obinutuzumab, has also been associated with an increased risk of retinal artery occlusion.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to begin valganciclovir hydrochloride therapy and sample intraocular fluid for polymerase chain reaction testing to confirm the diagnosis of retinal artery occlusion. This will help guide further management and prevent any potential long-term visual loss.

The other options are not the most appropriate next steps for the following reasons:

* Performing a vitreous tap and injection of intravitreal antibiotics (Option A) may not be effective in treating a retinal artery occlusion and may even cause further complications.
* Reviewing medical records to see if gentamicin was given intraoperatively (Option B) may not be relevant to the patient's current symptoms and physical examination findings.
* Urgently referring the patient to the emergency department for embolic stroke workup (Option C) may not be necessary at this time, as the patient's symptoms and examination findings are more consistent with a retinal artery occlusion than a stroke.

Answer: C: Peripheral blood smear and flow cytometry
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as the purpuric rash, digital ischemia, and retinal vasculitis, suggest a systemic vasculitis affecting the skin and eyes. The presence of antisynthetase syndrome and negative infectious workup results support this diagnosis. Peripheral blood smear and flow cytometry would be useful in evaluating the patient's blood cells and identifying any abnormalities that may be contributing to the vasculitis. This information would help guide further management and immunosuppressive therapy.

While option A, escalating systemic immunosuppression, may be appropriate in some cases, it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's management. Option B, diagnostic anterior chamber paracentesis and intravitreal foscarnet, may be necessary in some cases of retinal vasculitis, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's management given the systemic nature of the disease. Option D, whole-body positron emission tomography–computed tomography, may be useful in evaluating the extent of the vasculitis, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's management given the already established diagnosis of systemic vasculitis.

Cutaneous lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the skin and can cause skin lesions, nodules, and tumors. The patient's age and lack of other symptoms, such as fever, chills, fatigue, night sweats, or weight loss, also support this diagnosis. Aleukemic cutaneous myeloid sarcoma, lepromatous leprosy, and sarcoidosis can also cause skin lesions, but the patient's symptoms and histologic findings do not support these diagnoses.

The histopathologic features described, including prominent stromal fibrosis, collections of ductal structures with varying degrees of cystic change, and acinar cells with brightly eosinophilic intracytoplasmic granules, are also consistent with SPA. Additionally, the patient's history of recurrent upper respiratory infections and previous adenotonsillectomy and ear tube placement suggest a possible association with chronic inflammation and obstruction of the parotid gland, which can predispose to the development of SPA. Acinic cell carcinoma, mammary analog secretory carcinoma, and myoepithelial carcinoma are less likely diagnoses based on the clinical and histopathologic features described.

Additionally, the patient's history of immigration to Israel 9 years before admission and the absence of any other significant medical history, make Leishmania recidivans (option D) an unlikely diagnosis. Granulomatous mycosis fungoides (option B) is a rare condition that usually presents with papules, nodules, or plaques on the skin, and Lupus pernio (option A) typically presents with violaceous, indurated, and telangiectatic plaques on the face, ears, and extremities, which are not consistent with the patient's presentation.

Answer: D Test for serum antitissue transglutaminase antibody.
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of diarrhea and rash suggest a possible diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis, an autoimmune disease that is associated with celiac disease. Celiac disease is an autoimmune reaction to gluten, which can cause inflammation in the small intestine and lead to malabsorption. The patient's history of poor appetite and weight loss, as well as her low serum albumin level, suggest that she may have malabsorption. The patient's low serum copper level is also consistent with celiac disease, as copper deficiency is a common complication of celiac disease. Testing for serum antitissue transglutaminase antibody (tTG) is a specific and sensitive test for celiac disease, and a positive result would support this diagnosis. Measuring fecal calprotectin level (option A) may also be useful in diagnosing celiac disease, but it is not as specific as testing for tTG. Checking for fecal ova and parasites (option B) is not likely to be helpful in this case, as the patient's symptoms do not suggest a parasitic infection. Measuring serum niacin level (option C) is not relevant to the patient's symptoms or potential diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination findings, including bilateral proptosis, conjunctival erythema, chemosis, and bilateral lower eyelid retraction, suggest a diagnosis of bilateral extraocular muscle enlargement. The radiographic images (Figure 1B) show marked enlargement of all extraocular muscles bilaterally, with sparing of the anterior tendinous insertions. These findings are consistent with an orbital inflammatory condition, such as thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO).

The patient's history of hypothyroidism and hematologic malignancy increases the likelihood of TAO. The absence of thyroid-stimulating hormone, thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin, and thyroid peroxidase antibody levels suggests that the patient does not have Graves' disease. The negative test results for autoimmune diseases, including sarcoidosis, Sjogren syndrome, granulomatous polyangiitis, IgG4 disease, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, inflammatory bowel disease, and vasculitis, also support the diagnosis of TAO.

Given the patient's symptoms and examination findings, as well as the radiographic evidence of bilateral extraocular muscle enlargement, the next step would be to perform an extraocular muscle biopsy (Option C) to confirm the diagnosis of TAO. This would help guide further management and treatment decisions.

Option A, prescribing high-dose intravenous steroids, may be considered as a treatment option for TAO, but it would not be the next step in management.

Option B, performing staged bilateral orbital decompressions, may be considered as a treatment option for severe TAO, but it would not be the next step in management given the patient's current symptoms and examination findings.

Option D, referring for bilateral orbital external beam radiation, would not be appropriate at this time, as there is no evidence to suggest that radiation therapy is necessary for the patient's condition

Answer: C. Start systemic corticosteroids.
Explanation: The patient's presentation of unilateral periorbital swelling and erythema, along with the finding of a large exudative retinal detachment on dilated fundus examination, suggests a possible diagnosis of orbital inflammation or cellulitis. The patient's recent intra-arterial chemotherapy and upper respiratory tract infection increase the likelihood of an infectious etiology. Systemic corticosteroids would be appropriate to reduce inflammation and prevent further tissue damage. Intravenous vancomycin and cefepime (answer A) may be necessary if there is evidence of a bacterial infection, but they would not address the underlying inflammation. Examination under anesthesia (answer B) may be necessary for further evaluation, but it would not be the most appropriate next step. Observing the patient (answer D) without initiating any treatment may allow the condition to progress and result in further vision loss.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and clinical findings, such as tender, erythematous plaques and nodules on the distal limbs, palms, and soles that progressed to the proximal limbs and lower trunk, are consistent with neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis (NEH). NEH is a rare adverse event associated with chemotherapy, and it is characterized by a leukocytoclastic neutrophilic infiltrate in the deeper dermis, around appendage structures and coiled eccrine glands, and into the interstitium, as seen in the hematoxylin-eosin–stained specimen (Figure, C). The patient's history of acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage and recent chemotherapy treatment increase the likelihood of NEH. The patient's allergy to cashew nuts and previous episode of urticaria during a platelet transfusion may also contribute to the development of NEH. The absence of any infectious source to explain the fever, along with the patient's recent chemotherapy treatment, supports the diagnosis of NEH. Sweet syndrome, urticaria, and leukemia cutis are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and clinical findings. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as bilateral neck swelling, discrete dysphonia, and a rash, are consistent with Angioneurotic edema. Additionally, the CT scan results show infiltration of the mediastinal fat, which is also consistent with this diagnosis. The absence of traumatic or iatrogenic triggers and the lack of vascular thrombosis or dental abnormality also support this diagnosis. Cervical necrotizing fasciitis would be characterized by necrotic tissue and an inflammatory response, which is not seen in this case. Spontaneous lymphorrhea is unlikely given the patient's age and lack of any known lymphatic disorders. Quincke edema is a possibility, but the patient's symptoms and CT scan results do not strongly support this diagnosis.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea, dysphonia, dysphagia, and neck swelling, along with the physical examination findings of ecchymosis and fullness in the left submandibular region, are consistent with angioedema. The patient's history of factor V Leiden deficiency and anticoagulation therapy increases the likelihood of angioedema. Additionally, the imaging findings of a large, intermediate-density, modestly enhancing, left-sided submucosal lesion extending from the nasopharynx inferiorly to the glottis with encroachment on the airway, and the flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy findings of a large submucosal mass obstructing the view of the left supraglottis, glottis, and piriform sinus, are also consistent with angioedema. The other options, abscess, head and neck malignant neoplasm(s), and spontaneous airway hemorrhage with obstructive hematoma, do not explain the patient's symptoms and imaging findings as well as angioedema.

Explanation: The patient's history of slightly pruritic lesions involving her face, along with the physical examination findings of multiple skin-colored and erythematous follicular papules distributed in a segmental pattern on the right side of the forehead, as well as the dorsum and tip of the nose, are consistent with a diagnosis of follicular mucinous nevus. The histopathological features shown in Figure 1B and C, which include a proliferation of follicular epithelium and an accumulation of mucin in the dermis, further support this diagnosis. Lichen striatus typically presents as a linear or streaky eruption on the skin, often with an itchy or burning sensation, and is more commonly seen in children and young adults. Idiopathic follicular mucinosis is a rare condition characterized by the development of multiple small, skin-colored or erythematous papules on the face, but it typically lacks the linear distribution and follicular involvement seen in this case. Trichodysplasia spinulosa is a rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormal differentiation of hair follicles, leading to the formation of small, rough, skin-colored or hyperpigmented papules on the skin, but it is not associated with mucin accumulation in the dermis.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of a slow-growing, nontender plaque on the lower back, with hypertrichosis and pigmented macules, is consistent with a diagnosis of smooth muscle hamartoma. The histopathological findings of diffuse dermal infiltration of spindle cells, predominantly encircling terminal folliculosebaceous units, and positive immunohistochemical staining for S100 in the mid to deep dermis, also support this diagnosis. Neurocristic hamartoma (option B) is a benign tumor that typically affects the skin and subcutaneous tissue, but it is less likely given the absence of a family history of neurofibromatosis type 1 or 2. Becker nevus (option A) is a type of epidermal nevus that can present with hypertrichosis and pigmentation, but it typically has a more rapid growth rate and a more characteristic histopathological appearance. Plexiform neurofibroma (option D) is a type of benign nerve sheath tumor that can also present with hypertrichosis and pigmentation, but it typically has a more complex and varied histopathological appearance.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination findings, such as shortness of breath, productive cough, fatigue, weight loss, night sweats, palpitations, chest discomfort, and lower-extremity swelling, suggest a possible cardiac etiology. The electrocardiogram (ECG) shows atrial flutter, which is a type of arrhythmia that can be caused by various cardiac conditions. The computed tomographic angiogram (CTA) reveals an acute pulmonary embolism, multiple bilateral pulmonary nodules, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and a right atrial mass. The transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) with 2-dimensional speckle-tracking strain shows a 4.5 × 3.6 × 3.1-cm pedunculated right atrial mass attached to the interatrial septum near the fossa ovalis, which is consistent with a cardiac tumor. The left ventricular function is reduced, and cardiac mechanics are markedly abnormal, suggesting a more diffuse myocardial process. Given these findings, the next step would be to perform a right heart catheterization for biopsy (option C) to confirm the diagnosis of a cardiac tumor and determine its nature. This would help guide further management and treatment.

Option A, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may also be useful in evaluating the cardiac tumor and assessing its extent, but it may not provide a definitive diagnosis of the tumor's nature.

Option B, positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT), may be helpful in evaluating the metastatic potential of the tumor, but it is not the most appropriate next step in diagnosing the primary cardiac tumor.

Option D, transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), may provide better visualization of the cardiac tumor and its relationship to the surrounding structures, but it may not provide a definitive diagnosis of the tumor's nature, and it may be more invasive than necessary at this stage.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of necrotizing vasculitis, a condition characterized by inflammation and damage to the blood vessels. The presence of purpura and petechiae on the right lower leg and foot, along with the fading of erythema when the leg is elevated, are all consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's history of recent trauma to the right ankle and foot, along with the presence of trace edema localized to the ankle, suggest that the necrotizing vasculitis may be related to a vasculitic reaction to the injury.

The laboratory results support this diagnosis, as the patient has a mild anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated creatinine level, which are all consistent with necrotizing vasculitis. The elevated C-reactive protein level also suggests that there is an ongoing inflammatory process.

Therefore, the next step in management would be to order antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, and complement levels to help confirm the diagnosis of necrotizing vasculitis and to rule out other potential causes of vasculitis, such as systemic lupus erythematosus or antiphospholipid syndrome.

Skin biopsy (option A) may also be useful in confirming the diagnosis, but it is not as urgent as ordering the laboratory tests mentioned above. Lower extremity duplex ultrasound (option C) may also be useful in evaluating the blood flow in the affected limb, but it is not as relevant to the patient's current symptoms and laboratory results. Antibiotic therapy (option D) is not indicated at this time, as there is no evidence of infection.

The patient's forgetfulness and word-finding difficulties are not sufficient to justify a diagnosis of dementia, and his performance on the STMS and neuropsychological assessment is average to above-average. Moreover, the patient's genetic test result does not confirm the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease, as the presence of the APOE ε4 allele does not necessarily mean that the patient will develop Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to reassure and address the patient's concerns and follow up in 1 year to monitor any changes in his cognitive function.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of bilateral ptosis and ophthalmoplegia, along with the physical examination findings of limited eye movements and negative review of systems, suggest a possible neurological cause. Ordering neuroimaging with MRI of the brain and orbits with and without contrast would be the appropriate next step to evaluate for any intracranial or orbital abnormalities that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. This would help to identify any potential causes such as a cranial nerve palsy, orbital tumor, or other structural abnormalities.

Surgical repair of ptosis with a frontalis sling (Option A) may be necessary in the future, but it would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Ordering an electrocardiogram (Option C) would not be relevant to the patient's symptoms or medical history. Investigating for thyroid eye disease (Option D) may also be appropriate, but it would not explain the bilateral nature of the patient's symptoms.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of headache, vomiting, and blurry vision, along with the physical examination findings of bilateral abduction deficits and bilateral optic disc swelling with obscuration of all borders, are concerning for a serious intracranial infection. The patient's recent treatment with intravenous ceftriaxone and vancomycin suggests that the infection may be bacterial in nature. The presence of thrombocytosis on laboratory studies also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of recent ear pain and fever suggests that the infection may have originated from a middle ear infection. Given these findings, the most appropriate next step would be to initiate anticoagulation therapy to prevent further complications from the suspected intracranial infection. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Initiation of anticoagulation.

Explanation: Given the patient's history of hypertension, family history of kidney failure, and the presence of retinal vasculitis and white matter hyperintensities on MRI, it is likely that the patient has a systemic inflammatory condition that is affecting both the kidneys and the brain. Genetic sequencing would be the most appropriate next step to identify a potential genetic cause of the patient's condition, such as a genetic kidney disease or a neurodegenerative disorder. Brain or kidney biopsy may also be considered, but genetic sequencing is a less invasive and potentially more informative test. A second CSF culture (option C) may not provide additional information beyond the normal CSF profiling and culture results already obtained. Aqueous humor paracentesis (option D) is not likely to provide relevant information in this case.

Explanation: Superficial keratectomy is the best option to confirm the diagnosis by histopathologic examination. The patient's symptoms of painless, progressive blurring of vision in his left eye, along with the grayish cornea opacity that extends into the visual axis, suggest a possible diagnosis of a corneal tumor. The absence of conjunctival erythema or feeder vessels at the limbus also supports this diagnosis. AS-OCT showing hyperreflective thickened epithelium further suggests a superficial corneal lesion. Superficial keratectomy would allow for a histopathologic examination of the lesion, which would confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.

Answer: C 
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as crusted lesions with purulent drainage, associated pruritus and pain, and a history of actinic keratoses on the scalp, are consistent with erosive pustular dermatosis (EPD). EPD is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by recurrent pustular eruptions on the scalp, face, and other sun-exposed areas. The patient's history of treatment with cetuximab, binimetinib, and encorafenib, which are associated with an increased risk of EPD, supports this diagnosis. The presence of methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus on wound culture further suggests that the patient has EPD. Folliculitis decalvans (option A) is a condition characterized by inflammation and destruction of the hair follicles, which may cause scarring alopecia, but it does not match the patient's symptoms. Squamous cell carcinoma (option B) is a type of skin cancer that may present with scalp lesions, but it is less likely given the patient's history of actinic keratoses and the absence of characteristic features of squamous cell carcinoma on physical examination. Pemphigus foliaceus (option D) is an autoimmune blistering disorder that may cause crusted lesions on the scalp, but it is unlikely given the patient's history of actinic keratoses and the absence of characteristic features of pemphigus foliaceus on physical examination.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as the erythematous annular plaques without scale on her right arm and bilateral legs, are consistent with granuloma annulare. The biopsy results also support this diagnosis, as they show superficial and deep perivascular and interstitial inflammation, as well as numerous scattered eosinophils. Additionally, the patient's history of receiving immunotherapy, specifically pembrolizumab and ipilimumab, increases the likelihood of this diagnosis, as granuloma annulare has been reported as a side effect of these drugs. The other options, such as eosinophilic annular erythema and drug-induced bullous pemphigoid, can also cause annular plaques, but do not fit as well with the patient's history and biopsy results. Erythema annulare centrifugum is a rare condition that is not associated with immunotherapy and does not have the same histopathological features as granuloma annulare. Therefore, option C is the most likely diagnosis.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as leonine facies, madarosis, and shortness of breath, along with the laboratory results of marked leukocytosis and lymphocytosis, suggest a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The histopathologic findings of a dense diffuse dermal lymphoid infiltrate composed of small to medium cells with irregular nuclear contours, and the positive immunohistochemistry staining for cyclin D1, also support this diagnosis. DLBCL is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that typically affects older adults and often presents with skin involvement, as in this case.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of a viral prodrome, palpitations, dizziness, and heart block suggests a possible diagnosis of a cardiac condition. The electrocardiogram shows a sinus rhythm with complete heart block, which is consistent with a diagnosis of atrioventricular (AV) block. The patient's history of fever, myalgias, sore throat, and cough suggests a possible viral infection, which could be causing the AV block. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed no structural abnormalities, which supports the diagnosis of AV block. Fluorine 18–labeledfluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography with computed tomography (FDG-PET–CT) showed a small focal area of FDG uptake in the region of the membranous septum, which could indicate inflammation or infection in the cardiac tissue. Given these findings, the best course of action would be to place a dual-chamber implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) to protect the patient from potential arrhythmic events.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's presentation of widespread edema and acute dermatitis, along with a history of atopic dermatitis and diarrhea, suggests a possible diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome. Nephrotic syndrome is a condition characterized by the loss of large amounts of protein in the urine. Therefore, it is appropriate to check urinalysis and urine microscopy to evaluate for protein in urine. This will help to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.

Option A, checking levels of serum protein, albumin, prealbumin, and other nutritional laboratory measures, may also be useful in evaluating the patient's nutritional status and potential malabsorption, but it is not the most appropriate next step given the patient's presentation and history.

Option C, performing a skin biopsy, may be necessary later on to confirm the diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this time.

Answer: D
Explanation: The child has a recurrent subconjunctival hemorrhage in the left eye, and the clinical examination revealed a small intraocular lesion at the 5-o'clock limbus. Additionally, ultrasound biomicroscopy demonstrated a large inferior orbital lesion. These findings suggest that the subconjunctival hemorrhage may be related to the orbital lesion, which could be a tumor or other type of mass. Therefore, it would be appropriate to refer the child for a biopsy of the lesion to determine the cause and appropriate treatment.

Aspirating the orbital lesion (option A) may not provide sufficient tissue for a diagnosis, and it carries a risk of introducing infection or bleeding. Scheduling an orbital computed tomography scan (option B) may also be appropriate, but it may not provide a definitive diagnosis, and it may not be necessary at this stage. Examining the abdomen during the EUA (option C) is not directly related to the child's symptoms and findings, and it may not provide useful information.

Answer: D
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of pain and swelling over the right orbit and upper eyelid, along with the physical examination findings of a fluctuant mass with surrounding erythema, are consistent with an abscess in the right supraorbital region. The CT scan findings of a right supraorbital abscess with mass effect resulting in right hypoglobus, multiple communicating channels through inner and outer tables with cortical breakthrough in the frontal sinus, and advanced dental caries that communicated directly with the maxillary sinus owing to cortex erosion, further support this diagnosis.

Given the presence of a supraorbital abscess, the appropriate next step would be to perform an anterior orbitotomy with abscess drainage in conjunction with endoscopic sinus surgery, which is option D. This surgical procedure would allow for drainage of the abscess and removal of any infected tissue in the orbit, as well as address any underlying sinus disease.

Administering intravenous antibiotics and observing the patient, as suggested in option B, may be appropriate for some orbital infections, but it would not be sufficient to treat an abscess that has formed in the orbit. Similarly, referring the patient to an ear, nose, and throat physician for removal of the frontal sinus cystic lining, as suggested in option C, may be necessary at some point in the patient's treatment, but it would not address the immediate need for drainage of the abscess. Excisional biopsy, as suggested in option A, would not be appropriate for this patient's condition.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of intermittent visual blurring, mild eyelid swelling, and conjunctival chemosis, along with the recent onset of a nonspecific dull headache and "whooshing" noise in the ear, suggest a possible diagnosis of a carotid cavernous fistula (CCF). This is a rare condition that can cause ocular symptoms due to abnormal communication between the carotid artery and the cavernous sinus. The patient's age and recent onset of symptoms also support this diagnosis.

Therefore, the next step would be to perform a general examination (for a port-wine stain) and dilated ophthalmoscopy to evaluate the retinal vasculature and optic disc. If the diagnosis of CCF is confirmed, urgent neuroimaging (such as MRI or CT angiography) would be necessary to evaluate the extent of the fistula and determine the appropriate treatment.

Option A, suggesting supportive strategies and increasing topical corticosteroid treatment or prescribing a topical NSAID, may provide some symptomatic relief but would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

Option B, prescribing an oral NSAID and/or systemic immunosuppression, and performing chest radiography, urinalysis, blood tests, and other studies, may be appropriate for certain inflammatory conditions, but it is not the most appropriate step in this case given the patient's symptoms and suspected diagnosis.

Option D, referring the patient for urgent neuroimaging, would be an appropriate step after the general examination and dilated ophthalmoscopy, but it is not the most appropriate answer given the patient's symptoms and suspected diagnosis.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of joint and musculoskeletal pain and fatigue, along with the laboratory results of borderline hypercalcemia and elevated parathyroid hormone level, suggest hyperparathyroidism. The ultrasound-guided biopsy of the thyroid nodule showed a benign colloid nodule with cystic changes, which is consistent with a parathyroid adenoma. The well-circumscribed fat density mass measuring 3.0 × 2.3 × 1.1-cm identified in the right retropharyngeal space posterior to the hypopharynx on computed tomography with intravenous contrast is likely an ectopic thyroid, which can occur in 1-2% of patients with hyperparathyroidism. This diagnosis would also explain the nonlocalizing findings of the preoperative technetium-99m (Tc-99m) sestamibi planar and single-photon emission computed tomographic/computed tomographic (SPECT/CT) imaging.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of rapidly progressive redness and stiffness of both hands, accompanied by multiple finger joint and right shoulder pain, are consistent with palmar fasciitis and polyarthritis syndrome. The absence of nailfold capillary changes and distal digital pitting, as well as the presence of tender nodules on the palms and interphalangeal joints, also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the results of the incisional skin biopsy and CT scan, showing bilateral ovarian tumors with highly suspect peritoneal metastases, suggest a possible underlying cause for the patient's symptoms. Therefore, option C is the most likely diagnosis.

Option A, Dupuytren contracture, is a condition that affects the hand and causes the fingers to bend inward, but it does not match the patient's symptoms of rapidly progressive redness and stiffness of both hands, or the presence of nodules on the palms and interphalangeal joints.

Option B, Fibroblastic rheumatism, is a rare condition that causes inflammation and scarring in the hands and feet, but it does not match the patient's symptoms of rapidly progressive redness and stiffness of both hands, or the presence of nodules on the palms and interphalangeal joints.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's history of a gradually enlarging, reddish hematomalike plaque with a brownish peripheral border in his left axilla, along with the absence of any systemic symptoms or local lymphadenopathy, suggests a diagnosis of Hobnail hemangioma. This is a rare benign vascular tumor that typically presents as a small, reddish-brown papule or plaque with a characteristic "hobnail" or "spiky" border. The patient's age and lack of any history of trauma also support this diagnosis. The negative serologic tests for HIV and hepatitis B and C, as well as the negative immunohistochemical staining for HHV-8 and WT1, further support the diagnosis of Hobnail hemangioma.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient has severe mitral regurgitation with a mean gradient of 21 mm Hg, which is causing mild exertional dyspnea and elevated jugular venous pulsation. However, she has declined anticoagulation and has a history of recurrent endocarditis. Given her history and the severity of her mitral regurgitation, medical management with metoprolol and enoxaparin may be a reasonable option to consider before proceeding with a more invasive procedure such as balloon mitral valvuloplasty or surgical MV replacement. Transcatheter MV-in-ring procedure may also be a viable option, but given the patient's history of recurrent endocarditis, the risk of valve infection may be higher with this approach. Therefore, option C is the most appropriate next step in management.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with neuroblastoma, a type of cancer that develops in the nerve tissue. The patient's age and the presence of a mass in the neck are also consistent with neuroblastoma. The patient's lack of fever and night sweats, as well as the absence of abdominal pain or difficulty swallowing, are also consistent with neuroblastoma. The patient's laboratory results, including leukocytosis with neutrophilia, anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and elevated C-reactive protein level, are also consistent with neuroblastoma. The patient's imaging results, including the MRI and PET/CT scans, are also consistent with neuroblastoma. Langerhans cell histiocytosis and Rosai-Dorfman disease are both rare disorders that can cause lymphadenopathy, but they are less likely given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results. Lymphoma is a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's age and the absence of other symptoms.

Answer: D
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of dry cough and consolidation lesion on chest radiography, along with the radiologist's suspicion of lymphangitic carcinomatosis, suggest a possible recurrence of lung cancer. However, the patient's history of ROS1-rearranged lung adenocarcinoma and previous response to ceritinib and crizotinib suggest that the recurrence may be related to TKI-induced interstitial lung disease. The patient's tumor marker CEA level decreasing from 14.76 to 0.71 ng/mL also supports this possibility. Therefore, option D, performing a CT-guided biopsy for histological confirmation of recurrence or identification of other benign disease, such as granulomatous inflammation, is the most appropriate next step in management. This will help to establish the diagnosis and guide further treatment.

Answer: C
Explanation:
The clinical presentation of a rapidly growing parotid mass and a subretinal lesion with intralesional, hyperechoic foci in a newborn with a history of maternal drug use and hepatitis C suggests a diagnosis of atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (ATRT). ATRT is a rare and aggressive tumor that can occur in various parts of the body, including the orbit and parotid gland. It is characterized by the presence of small blue cells with a fine chromatin granular pattern, as seen in the pathological specimen from the parotid gland in this case. The loss of INI-1, a tumor suppressor gene, is also a hallmark of ATRT. The hypermetabolic activity on FDG-PET and the lack of distant metastasis on computed tomography also support this diagnosis. While retinoblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, and medulloepithelioma can also present with orbital masses, they typically have different clinical and imaging features. Therefore, option C, atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor, is the most likely diagnosis.

Explanation: The patient's history of type 2 diabetes, atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, and hypertension suggests that they have a high risk of developing hypomagnesemia due to increased urinary magnesium loss. The patient's recent hemoglobin A1c level of 10.8% suggests that their diabetes is not well-controlled, which could contribute to the development of hypomagnesemia. Additionally, the patient's medication regimen, including loop diuretics and thiazolidinediones, may also contribute to urinary magnesium loss. Therefore, improving glycemic control and reducing urinary magnesium loss through better diabetes management would be an appropriate next step in the patient's care.

Explanation: The patient's history of rectal adenocarcinoma with lung metastases, along with the location and appearance of the subglottic mass, suggests that the most likely diagnosis is metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma. The patient's symptoms, such as lack of shortness of breath or noisy breathing, dysphagia, voice change, or hemoptysis, also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the fact that the patient had a confirmed partial response to chemotherapy and maintained it without evidence of progression of lung disease, suggests that the lesion is unlikely to be a primary lung cancer. The presence of prominent vasculature in the mass also supports the diagnosis of metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate answer.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's presentation of syncope and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia suggests a possible inherited arrhythmia. Treadmill stress testing can help evaluate the patient's heart rhythm and identify any abnormal responses to physical activity, which can be indicative of an inherited arrhythmia. Additionally, the patient's history of heroin use increases the likelihood of an inherited arrhythmia. It is important to note that the patient's negative urine toxicology test does not rule out the possibility of drug use, as the drug may have already been metabolized and cleared from their system. Therefore, option C is the most appropriate next step in the patient's management.

Option A, starting amiodarone infusion therapy, may be appropriate for the management of certain arrhythmias, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as the patient's arrhythmia has not been definitively diagnosed.

Option B, implanting an internal implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, may be necessary in the future if the patient is diagnosed with a life-threatening arrhythmia, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this time, as the patient's arrhythmia has not been fully evaluated.

Option D, sending blood tests for drug levels, may be appropriate to rule out drug-induced arrhythmia, but it is not the most appropriate next step, as the patient's history of heroin use and the presence of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia suggest a higher likelihood of an inherited arrhythmia.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of generalized weakness, increased sweating, severe nausea, and vomiting, as well as the bilateral hyperdensity of the globus pallidi on the computed tomography scan, are consistent with organophosphate poisoning. The patient's recent travel to Cuba and exposure to pesticides or other chemicals while there, suggest a possible exposure to an organophosphate. Additionally, the patient's mild proximal muscle weakness with occasional bilateral upper extremity and lower extremity fasciculations and jerky movements, are also consistent with organophosphate poisoning. It's worth noting that the patient's urine toxicology screen was negative, but this does not rule out organophosphate poisoning as some organophosphates may not be detected by standard toxicology screens.

It's important to note that the other options are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and test results. Carbon monoxide poisoning would not explain the bilateral hyperdensity of the globus pallidi, and the patient's symptoms are not consistent with methanol or Fahr disease.

Answer: C
Explanation:
The correct answer is C, scalp metastasis. The patient's history of a solitary, asymptomatic lump on her scalp that has grown in size following minor local trauma, along with the clinical and dermoscopic findings of an ill-defined, infiltrated plaque with a normochromic, exophytic nodule and absence of follicular ostia, are consistent with a metastatic lesion. The patient's family history of metastatic cutaneous melanoma in her father also supports this diagnosis. The brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and punch biopsy results further support the diagnosis of scalp metastasis.

The other options are less likely:

A, chondroid syringoma, is a benign tumor that typically appears as a small, firm nodule on the scalp, but it is not associated with a history of trauma or family history of melanoma.

B, cutaneous meningeal heterotopia, is a rare congenital malformation that consists of meningeal tissue located outside the skull, but it is not typically associated with a solitary, asymptomatic lump on the scalp.

D, proliferative nodule in a congenital melanocytic nevus, is a possibility, but the patient's history and clinical findings do not support this diagnosis. The absence of any pigmented structures on dermoscopy and the lack of follicular ostia also make this diagnosis less likely.

Explanation: The correct answer is B, Eosinophilic dermatosis of hematologic malignancy. The patient's history of a recent diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the presence of a striking pruritic and generalized cutaneous eruption, and the histopathologic findings of a superficial and deep dermal perivascular and interstitial mononuclear infiltrate with numerous eosinophils are all consistent with this diagnosis. Eosinophilic dermatosis is a known complication of hematologic malignancies, particularly AML, and is characterized by a papulovesicular eruption with prominent eosinophilia. The other options do not fit the patient's clinical presentation or histopathologic findings. Option A, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, is unlikely given the absence of any new medications or systemic symptoms. Option C, urticarial vasculitis, is not supported by the histopathologic findings, which show a perivascular and interstitial infiltrate rather than a vasculitic pattern. Option D, urticarial bullous pemphigoid, is also not supported by the histopathologic findings, which do not show any evidence of blistering or bullous lesions.

The presence of a nonenhancing lesion obstructing the aqueduct of Sylvius, and the resolution of hydrocephalus and patent aqueduct of Sylvius on repeat MRI, further support this diagnosis. The patient's history of immigration from Guatemala, where neurocysticercosis is endemic, also increases the likelihood of this diagnosis.

Answer: D
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of dyschromic nails, exertional dyspnea, and lower extremity edema, along with the positive Stemmer sign, suggestive of lymphedema, are consistent with a diagnosis of systemic sclerosis (SSc). SSc is a connective tissue disease characterized by fibrosis and inflammation in the skin and internal organs. The patient's history of nasal congestion, persistent rhinorrhea, and postnasal drip, as well as the finding of bilateral maxillary and posterior ethmoidal sinusitis on CT scan, suggest that the patient may have a coexisting condition such as chronic rhinosinusitis. The patient's history of hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea may also be relevant to the patient's overall health and potential treatment plan, but they are not directly related to the likely diagnosis of SSc.

The laboratory findings, including a positive ANA and low C3 complement level, are consistent with SSc. The patient's mildly low C3 complement level may indicate complement consumption, which is a common finding in SSc. The negative results of testing for antibodies to extractable nuclear antigens and double-stranded DNA suggest that the patient does not have a concurrent autoimmune disorder such as lupus.

Therefore, the next step in the patient's evaluation would be to order measurement of serum ferritin level, serum iron level, and serum total iron-binding capacity, as these tests can help support the diagnosis of SSc and assess the severity of the disease. Imaging studies, such as radiographs of the hands and feet, may also be useful in evaluating the extent of the disease, but they are not as directly relevant to the patient's likely diagnosis as the laboratory tests. Microscopy of nail scrapings after keratolysis with potassium hydroxide solution may be helpful in diagnosing fungal or other infections, but it is not directly related to the patient's likely diagnosis of SSc. A thoracic CT scan may be useful in evaluating the patient's chronic cough and assessing for any lung involvement, but it is not

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of watery diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss, along with the laboratory findings of hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, are consistent with ileal metastasis. The patient's history of metastatic appendiceal adenocarcinoma increases the likelihood of ileal metastasis. The computed tomography scan and ileocolonoscopy findings also support this diagnosis, as they reveal diffuse long-segment wall thickening and erythematous and congested mucosa with scattered erosions and ulcerations throughout the examined terminal ileum. Additionally, the histopathology results show features consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma. Therefore, option C, ileal metastasis, is the most likely diagnosis.

Option A, cytomegalovirus ileitis, is less likely as the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not suggest an active viral infection. Option B, capecitabine-induced terminal ileitis, is also less likely as the patient's symptoms began 3 weeks ago, and capecitabine was only recently initiated. Option D, small bowel carcinoid tumor, is unlikely given the patient's history of metastatic appendiceal adenocarcinoma and the absence of typical symptoms and laboratory findings associated with carcinoid tumors.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest retinal thinning, which could be related to the chronic angle-closure glaucoma. The patient's history of bilateral peripheral iridotomies and the asymmetrically enlarged cup-disc ratio with mild pallor of the left optic nerve also support this diagnosis. The patient's visual acuity and visual field testing results, as well as the OCT findings of nasal thinning of the right eye and diffuse thinning of the left eye, further support the diagnosis of retinal thinning. Therefore, referring the patient to a retina specialist for further evaluation and management is the most appropriate next step. Starting intraocular pressure-lowering medications (option B) may also be appropriate, but it is not the most urgent step in the patient's management.

Answer: D
Explanation: The patient presents with severe, progressive pain, redness, and decreased visual acuity in the left eye, along with scleral thinning and retinal detachment. These findings suggest a severe inflammatory process, likely related to the patient's history of thyroid eye disease and recent strabismus surgery. Initiating admission, high-dose systemic steroids, and a rheumatology consult would be appropriate to manage the patient's inflammation and prevent further vision loss.

Giving fortified antibiotics (option A) may be necessary, but it would not address the underlying inflammatory process. Giving topical steroids and cycloplegia (option B) may provide some symptomatic relief, but it would not adequately address the severe inflammation and retinal detachment. Providing systemic corticosteroids and outpatient follow-up (option C) may be appropriate for some patients, but in this case, the patient's severe symptoms and findings warrant inpatient management and close monitoring.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of recurrent sore throat, hoarseness of voice, and saddle-shaped deformity on his nose, along with the laboratory results of elevated C-reactive protein levels, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and microcytic hypochromic anemia, are consistent with eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA). EGPA is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the respiratory system and can cause inflammation of the cartilage, leading to deformities such as the saddle-shaped deformity on the patient's nose. The patient's history of recurrent auricular chondritis and perichondritis also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's symptoms of difficulty breathing when lying supine and soft inspiratory stridor are consistent with EGPA-related respiratory compromise. The negative results for antinuclear antibody, anti–double-stranded DNA, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies help to rule out other autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus or vasculitis.

Answer: C 
Explanation: The patient's presentation of hemorrhagic optic disc edema, peripapillary and subfoveal subretinal fluid, tortuous and dilated retinal vasculature, intraretinal hemorrhages in all 4 quadrants, and far peripheral temporal inner retinal whitening in both eyes, along with the workup findings of elevated opening pressure, elevated cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count, and severe anemia, are consistent with the diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). The patient's history of headaches, dizziness, and blurred vision also support this diagnosis. Therefore, the next step would be to advise urgent plasmapheresis in consultation with oncology, as IIH is associated with an increased risk of developing blood clots and plasmapheresis can help to reduce the risk of thrombotic events. Injecting intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (Option A) may be considered for the treatment of macular edema, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. Starting empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics and antivirals (Option B) is not indicated, as there is no evidence of infection or viral etiology. Initiating a hypercoagulability workup (Option D) may be considered, but it is not as urgent as plasmapheresis in this case.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of globus sensation, dysphagia, and localized throat swelling, along with the physical examination findings of a mucosally covered mass on the left lateral pharyngeal wall, are consistent with a diagnosis of a Tornwaldt cyst. The fact that the cyst communicates with the atlantoaxial joint, as demonstrated by the MRI, supports this diagnosis. A juxtafacet cyst (option A) is a type of cyst that forms between the facet joints of the spine, and is not typically associated with the symptoms described. A mucus retention cyst (option B) is a type of cyst that forms in the respiratory tract and is typically associated with chronic respiratory disease, not the symptoms described. A spinal bronchogenic cyst (option D) is a type of cyst that forms from abnormal development of the tracheobronchial tree, and is not typically associated with the symptoms described.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest the presence of iris neovascularization, which is characterized by the growth of new blood vessels on the iris. This condition is often associated with hypertension, diabetes, and other systemic diseases. The patient's history of transient vision loss and the presence of hyphema in the left eye suggest that the neovascularization is causing bleeding and obscuring the patient's vision.

The best course of action would be to photocoagulate the lesions with an argon laser at slitlamp evaluation. This would help to reduce the bleeding and prevent further vision loss. Observation until repeated incident (option A) may not be sufficient to address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, and intravitreal bevacizumab injections (option C) may not be effective in treating iris neovascularization. Iridocyclectomy (option D) is a more invasive procedure that involves excision of the lesions, and may not be necessary at this stage.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with IgG4-related disease, a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by the infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells into various organs, including the nasal passages. The patient's elevated IgG4 levels and the presence of IgG4-positive plasma cells in the surgical pathology specimen support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's lack of systemic symptoms, such as oral ulcers, sicca, photosensitivity, dermatitis, or arthralgias, which are commonly seen in eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), makes IgG4-related disease a more likely diagnosis. The presence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Bacteroides in the nasal cultures may also support this diagnosis, as these organisms have been implicated in the development of IgG4-related disease.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's presentation of chest pain, dyspnea, weight loss, and elevated troponin suggests a possible cardiac etiology. The electrocardiogram shows left-axis deviation, inferior Q waves, and poor R-wave progression, which are consistent with a cardiac condition. The cardiac magnetic resonance imaging reveals foci of delayed mid-myocardial gadolinium enhancement, diffuse pericardial thickening, severe biventricular systolic dysfunction, and a small pericardial effusion, indicating a likely diagnosis of myocarditis. Given the patient's history of asthma and recent onset of adult-onset asthma, it is possible that her myocarditis is related to an allergic or immune-mediated process. Urgently starting high-dose steroids, colchicine, and high-dose nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) during hospitalization would be the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's condition, as it could help reduce inflammation and prevent further cardiac damage. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

The presence of Pautrier microabscesses and CD30 immunohistochemical stain highlighting atypical lymphocytes further support this diagnosis. Erythema gyratum repens is a rare clinical presentation of MF, and the patient's age and intermittent pruritus also align with this diagnosis. Therefore, option B (Erythema gyratum repens–like eruption associated with mycosis fungoides) is the most appropriate answer.

Answer: C
Explanation: The enhancing structure at the skull base along the carotid sheath is most likely a schwannoma, which is a benign tumor that originates from the supporting cells of the nervous system, specifically the Schwann cells. The location of the tumor, adjacent to the carotid sheath, is consistent with the typical location of schwannomas in the head and neck region. Additionally, the imaging findings of an enhancing structure on contrast-enhanced computed tomography are also consistent with schwannoma. While paraganglioma (B) and persistent trigeminal artery (C) can also present as enhancing structures in the skull base, they are less likely given the location and imaging findings described. Persistent hypoglossal artery (D) is also an unlikely diagnosis as it typically presents as a small, non-enhancing structure and is not typically located adjacent to the carotid sheath.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of floaters, blurry vision, and eye pain, along with the physical examination findings of intraretinal hemorrhages, retinal neovascularization, and macular traction, suggest a possible diagnosis of retinal vasculitis. The presence of a violaceous maculopapular rash on the face and upper extremities, patchy hair loss, and a history of myopia also support this diagnosis. Retinal vasculitis is a known complication of antiphospholipid syndrome, which is present in the patient's family history. Therefore, the next step would be to perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the brain to rule out any intracranial causes of retinal vasculitis, such as a stroke or a tumor. This would help guide further management and treatment of the patient's condition. The other options, such as a vitreous tap for viral polymerase chain reaction or administering an intravitreal injection of foscarnet, may also be considered, but MRI/MRA is the most appropriate next step in this case.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and signs, such as progressive, diffuse redness and tearing in the left eye, extensive keratinization of the conjunctiva, and neovascular fronds, are consistent with cicatricial disease, a group of conditions characterized by inflammation and scarring of the ocular surface. Given the patient's history of hypothyroidism, the possibility of a thyroid-related autoimmune disorder should be considered. Vitamin A deficiency is a known risk factor for thyroid-related eye disease, and testing for vitamin A deficiency and performing conjunctival biopsies for pathologic evaluation and testing for immune deposits can help to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management. Starting treatment with frequent artificial tears 4 times daily and following up in 6 months (Option A) may provide some symptomatic relief, but it does not address the underlying cause of the disease. Stopping brimonidine-timolol drops without further intervention or evaluation (Option C) may be appropriate if the patient's symptoms are related to the medication, but it does not address the underlying disease process. Performing extensive excision of the lesion with ocular surface reconstruction, followed by disposal of the biopsy specimen (Option D) may be necessary in some cases, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's management.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of edematous and ulcerative eruption with nasolabial sparing, along with the patient's history of extreme fatigue, weight loss, and recent episode of hematochezia, suggests a diagnosis of Sweet syndrome. This is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by the rapid development of painful, edematous, and necrotic skin lesions, often with nasal sparing. The patient's history of taking medications for 5 years without new exposures and the absence of fever suggest that drug-induced vasculitis is less likely. The presence of leukocytosis, normocytic anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hematuria, and proteinuria in the patient's laboratory evaluation also supports the diagnosis of Sweet syndrome. The patient's age and the presence of parenchymal lung nodules on computed tomography further support this diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as bilateral hand pain and swelling of the MCP and PIP joints, as well as the plain radiographs showing hook-like osteophytes and joint narrowing, are consistent with a diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis. The patient's family history, with a brother having osteoarthritis, hypogonadism, and type 2 diabetes, also supports this diagnosis. Therefore, it would be appropriate to order magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the sacroiliac joint to further evaluate the patient's sacroiliac joints and confirm the diagnosis.

The other options are not appropriate for the patient's current condition. Checking ferritin and transferrin saturation (option A) would not be relevant for the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Checking rheumatoid factor (RF) (option B) may be appropriate later in the patient's management, but it is not the most appropriate next step.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's history of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, as well as the presence of green-gray nodules on the chest, are consistent with a diagnosis of chloroma. Chloroma is a rare form of skin cancer that typically occurs in patients with a history of AML or other hematologic malignancies. It is characterized by the presence of green-gray nodules or plaques on the skin, which are composed of immature myeloid cells. The patient's lack of symptoms and the stability of the lesions since onset also support this diagnosis. Merkel cell carcinoma (option A) is a type of skin cancer that typically affects the sun-exposed areas of the body and is not associated with a history of AML or hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (option C) is a rare form of skin cancer that can occur in patients with a history of AML, but it typically presents with more widespread skin lesions and a worse prognosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of acute ptosis in the left upper eyelid, along with the history of severe left-sided facial pain, suggest a possible diagnosis of a cranial nerve disorder. Specifically, the patient's symptoms are consistent with a possible diagnosis of a sixth nerve palsy. The patient's hypertension may also be a contributing factor.

Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the brain and neck would be the most appropriate next step in the patient's workup, as it can help to identify any vascular abnormalities that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms, such as a vasculitis or atherosclerosis affecting the cranial nerves.

An edrophonium test (Option A) may also be considered, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a cranial nerve disorder rather than a myasthenia gravis.

Oculoplastic referral for ptosis repair (Option B) may be necessary in the future, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this point in the patient's workup, as the underlying cause of the ptosis needs to be determined first.

Sumatriptan injection (Option D) is not indicated in this case, as the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a migraine or cluster headache.

Answer: C
Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of flushing, vomiting, and abdominal pain, along with the findings of a thoracic paraspinal mass on imaging and a dense cellular infiltrate on histopathology, are consistent with a diagnosis of malignant pheochromocytoma. Pheochromocytomas are rare tumors that arise from the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla and can produce excessive amounts of catecholamines, leading to symptoms such as flushing, hypertension, and palpitations. The patient's age and the location of the mass are also consistent with this diagnosis, as pheochromocytomas typically affect adults in their 40s and 50s and are often located in the abdomen or thorax.

The other options are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and imaging findings. Histiocytoma (option A) is a benign tumor that arises from histiocyte cells and typically affects children and young adults. While it can cause symptoms such as pain and swelling, it is not typically associated with flushing, vomiting, or abdominal pain. Mastocytoma (option B) is a type of malignant tumor that arises from mast cells and can cause symptoms such as skin lesions, pruritus, and anaphylaxis. However, it is not typically associated with a paraspinal mass or the patient's other symptoms. Myeloid sarcoma (option D) is a rare type of cancer that arises from myeloid cells and can affect various parts of the body, including the abdomen and thorax. However, it is not typically associated with a paraspinal mass or the patient's other symptoms.

The fact that the family reported living in a rural area on the Mediterranean coast, where leishmaniasis is endemic, supports this diagnosis. Herpetic whitlow (A) and bacterial paronychia (B) are both infections that can cause similar symptoms, but they are typically not associated with the presence of granulomas or intracellular amastigotes.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of painless decrease in visual acuity, new keratic precipitates, and anterior chamber inflammation, along with the negative culture results for mycobacteria, fungus, and bacteria, suggest that the cause of the inflammation is likely due to a viral infection. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common cause of viral keratitis and endotheliitis, and the presence of coin-shaped lesions in the graft suggests that CMV endotheliitis may be present. Performing a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of aqueous humor for CMV DNA can help confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment. Increasing steroids (option A) may help reduce inflammation, but it will not treat the underlying viral infection. A vitreous tap with intravitreal antibiotic injection (option C) may be necessary if the PCR is positive, but it is not the next step in management. Empirical treatment with acyclovir (option D) may be appropriate if the PCR is positive, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management.

Answer: C
Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of persistent frontal swelling, pain, and pressure, along with the physical examination findings of symmetric facial movement and soft tissue thickening, are consistent with a sinonasal masses. The patient's history of chronic sinusitis and treatment resistance to oral antibiotics and steroids also support this diagnosis. The imaging findings of a soft tissue mass anterior to the axilla of the middle turbinates bilaterally, with normal-appearing mucosa overlying, are also consistent with a sinonasal mass.

The pathology results of uniform, epithelioid cells arranged in a whorled, lobulated growth pattern without atypia, necrosis, increased cellularity, or diffuse growth pattern are consistent with a diagnosis of sinonasal meningioma. Meningioma is a type of slow-growing tumor that arises from the meninges, the protective coverings of the brain and spinal cord. It is more common in older adults and typically presents with symptoms of mass effect, such as headaches, facial pain or swelling, and nasal obstruction.

Esthesioneuroblastoma (Option A) is a rare type of nasal tumor that typically presents with nasal obstruction, bleeding, and facial pain. It is more aggressive than meningioma and has a higher recurrence rate. Pott puffy tumor (Option B) is a type of benign nasal tumor that typically presents with nasal obstruction and is more common in children and young adults. Sinonasal neuroendocrine carcinoma (Option D) is a rare type of cancer that typically presents with symptoms of nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and facial pain. It is more aggressive than meningioma and has a higher recurrence rate.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, imaging results, and pathology results, the most likely diagnosis is sinonasal meningioma (Option C).

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of exertional left calf discomfort, worsening with activity and relieved with rest, are consistent with peripheral artery disease (PAD). The patient's history of hypertension and age also increase her risk for PAD. The exercise treadmill ankle-brachial index (ABI) test results show a significant decrease in the ankle-brachial index (ABI) during exercise, indicating a decrease in blood flow to the lower extremities, which is consistent with PAD. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to diagnose the patient with PAD and begin medical management, which includes lifestyle modifications, medications, and possible revascularization procedures.

The other options are not appropriate for the following reasons:

B: Ordering a lower extremity angiogram would be an appropriate step if the patient had a positive ABI test result, but the patient's ABI test result was negative.

C: Ordering a lower extremity arterial duplex ultrasound may be appropriate if the patient had a positive ABI test result, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and imaging findings are concerning for a possible appendiceal mass, which could be a sign of appendiceal cancer. While the patient's history of uterine carcinoma increases the likelihood of a metastatic lesion, it is important to note that appendiceal cancer can also present with a mass and ascites. Therefore, it is appropriate to proceed with a diagnostic colonoscopy to evaluate the lesion and determine the appropriate course of action. Repeat image-guided paracentesis/cytology (option B) may also be considered, but colonoscopy is a more invasive and definitive diagnostic test. Broad-spectrum antibiotics (option D) may be appropriate if there is a concern for infection, but they would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Laparoscopic appendectomy and peritoneal biopsy (option A) may be necessary if the diagnosis is appendiceal cancer, but it is premature to proceed with surgery without further diagnostic information.

Explanation: The patient's history of a mildly pruritic plaque on the elbow, which has been growing slowly over time, and the presence of yellow-white micaceous scale with interspersed punctate hemorrhagic crusts, are consistent with Koebnerized psoriasis vulgaris. The histopathological findings of psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia overlying suppurative granulomatous infiltrates with multinucleate giant cells and rare eosinophilic spheroid forms, also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the absence of lymphadenopathy and the lack of other systemic symptoms, make it less likely that the diagnosis is granulomatosis with polyangiitis (C) or sarcoidosis (D). Sporotrichosis (A) is a fungal infection that typically presents with ulcerated nodules or papules, and is less likely given the patient's history and clinical presentation.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's sudden hypotension and cardiac arrest during PCI suggests a severe cardiogenic shock. In this scenario, initiating venoarterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) would be an appropriate next step. ECMO can provide both respiratory and cardiac support, which would help to stabilize the patient's condition and allow for further management.

Option A, inserting a percutaneous left ventricular assist device, may also be considered, but it would not provide immediate support for the patient's respiratory failure, which is a critical aspect of cardiogenic shock.

Option B, performing pericardiocentesis with autologous blood transfusion, is not directly related to the patient's current condition and would not address the underlying cause of the shock.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of dysphonia, throat tightness, and consistent voice roughness, as well as the physical examination findings of moderate to severe dysphonia with predominant roughness and strain, are consistent with a diagnosis of vocal fold fullness. The videostroboscopy findings of residual fullness of the left false vocal fold and appearance of prolapsed ventricular mucosa obstructing the lateral extent of the left true vocal fold, as well as the reduction of lateral excursion of the mucosal wave on the left, further support this diagnosis. The patient's history of heavy voice use and asthma treated with inhaled steroids also increases the likelihood of vocal fold fullness.

The patient's age and lack of other symptoms make it less likely that the lesion is a saccular cyst (Option A). Chondroid metaplasia (Option B) is a possibility, but the presence of a firm lesion in the left paraglottic space extending to the lateral aspect of the true vocal fold, as well as the histologic specimen showing fragments of cartilage with no nuclear atypia or mitosis, makes chondroma (Option C) a more likely diagnosis. Chondrosarcoma (Option D) is a rare malignancy that typically affects the larynx in older patients and is characterized by a firm, painless mass that can cause vocal cord paralysis. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest a malignancy, making chondrosarcoma less likely.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and the histopathological findings described in the case study are consistent with a diagnosis of blue nevus. Blue nevi are benign melanocytic neoplasms that are characterized by the presence of dendritic melanocytes in the epithelium, which is consistent with the histologic findings described in the case study. The irregular borders and brown pigmentation of the lesion are also consistent with a blue nevus. Focal melanotic macule (option A) is a benign condition characterized by an accumulation of melanin in a small area of the skin or mucosa, but it does not have the same histopathological features as blue nevus. Oral melanoacanthosis (option B) is a rare condition characterized by an increase in melanin production in the oral mucosa, but it typically affects the entire oral mucosa, rather than a single patch. Malignant melanoma (option D) is a malignant tumor that arises from pigment-producing cells, but it typically has a more aggressive clinical appearance and histopathological features than what is described in the case study. Therefore, option C, blue nevus, is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive, unilateral lower lip and chin numbness, as well as the physical examination findings of a sensory deficit limited to the distribution of the mandibular branch of the left trigeminal nerve (V3), are consistent with a diagnosis of an odontogenic keratocyst (OKC). The lesion's location in the left masticator space, centered in the lateral pterygoid muscle, and the benign-appearing remodeling of the posterior maxillary wall, are also consistent with an OKC. Additionally, the patient's history of occasional lip biting due to numbness, and the absence of other cranial nerve deficits, are also consistent with an OKC.

The other options are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings. Schwannoma (A) is a benign tumor of the nerve sheath that can cause numbness or weakness, but it typically affects a wider area of the face and does not have the same location or characteristics as the lesion described in the case. Juvenile angiofibroma (B) is a benign tumor of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses that can cause nasal obstruction, bleeding, and facial pain, but it is not typically associated with numbness or weakness of the lower lip and chin. Chondrosarcoma (D) is a malignant tumor of cartilage that can affect the skull and facial bones, but it is rare and typically presents with more severe symptoms, such as pain, swelling, and difficulty swallowing or breathing.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and imaging findings are consistent with metastatic sarcoma. The presence of bilateral carotid space masses, hepatic masses, and numerous CT occult osseous lesions, as well as the intense radiotracer uptake on gallium Ga 68 dotatate positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI), support this diagnosis. The patient's history of asthma and treatment with antibiotics without improvement also suggest a malignant rather than an infectious process. Glomus vagale tumors and carotid body tumors are rare and typically present with different symptoms and imaging findings. Lymphoma can also present with similar symptoms, but the imaging findings and intense radiotracer uptake on PET/MRI are more consistent with sarcoma.

Answer: C: Order optical coherence tomography
Explanation: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive imaging test that can provide detailed information about the retina and macula. Given the patient's symptoms of bilateral central vision loss and the physical examination findings of bilateral reddened foveal lesions and irregular macular pigmentation, OCT is the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic workup. It can help to identify any structural abnormalities in the retina and macula, such as edema, fluid accumulation, or scar tissue, which may be causing the patient's symptoms. Additionally, OCT can also help to assess the severity of the disease and monitor any changes over time.

The other options are not as appropriate for the following reasons:

* A: Indocyanine green angiography is a test that is used to evaluate the blood vessels in the retina, and is not typically used to evaluate macular edema or other structural abnormalities in the retina.
* B: Discontinuing immunosuppression therapy may be necessary if the patient's symptoms are related to an adverse effect of the medication, but it is not the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic workup.
* D: Repeating neuroimaging may be necessary if the patient's symptoms persist or worsen over time, but it is not the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic workup at this time.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), a condition characterized by increased intracranial pressure without an identifiable cause. The patient's age and obesity are risk factors for IIH. The patient's normal visual acuity, normal fundus examination, and normal visual fields suggest that the condition is unlikely to be caused by a mass lesion or stroke. The patient's severe optic nerve edema and increased retinal nerve fiber layer thickness are consistent with IIH. Venography (computed tomography or magnetic resonance) of the brain would be the next appropriate step to evaluate the patient's condition and determine the cause of the increased intracranial pressure. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

Explanation: The patient's history of heavy alcohol consumption and tobacco use suggests a possible deficiency in vitamin B12 and folate. Vitamin B12 deficiency can cause optic neuropathy, which presents with symptoms similar to those described by the patient, such as gradual vision loss, blurred margins, and telangiectatic vessels on the surface of the optic nerve. Folate deficiency can also cause optic neuropathy, and it is possible that the patient's heavy alcohol consumption may have contributed to a deficiency in folate. Therefore, assessing serum vitamin B12 and folate levels would be an appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation.

Explanation: The patient's worsening pain and visual acuity, as well as the presence of diffuse microcystoid epithelial and stromal edema in both eyes, suggest a possible adverse reaction to netarsudil. Discontinuing netarsudil in both eyes (option C) would be the appropriate next step in managing this patient's condition, as it may be contributing to the edema and worsening reticular changes in the right eye. Stopping timolol (option A) or latanoprost (option B) may also be considered, but discontinuing netarsudil is the most likely solution given the patient's history of successful monocular trial and the recent worsening of symptoms.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of worsening pain, dynamic color changes, and ulcerations involving the fingertips, as well as the positive ANA and subserologic testing, suggest a diagnosis of systemic sclerosis (SSc), a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by fibrosis and vasculopathy. The patient's mild esophageal dysphagia and hair loss are also consistent with SSc. It is important to note that the patient has no evidence of sclerodactyly or proximal skin thickening, which are common features of SSc. However, the presence of fine wrinkles and normal-appearing skin folds on the hands and face suggest that the patient may have an early form of SSc, known as limited cutaneous SSc.

The next step in management would be to start empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy, as there is a risk of infection with ulcerations. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not suggest a need for intravenous pulse-dose methylprednisolone or therapeutic anticoagulation with heparin at this time. Vasodilator therapy with nifedipine may be considered in the future if the patient develops severe digital ulcerations or other evidence of vasculopathy.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including the erythematous and scaly plaques, weight loss, and neurological symptoms, are consistent with interstitial granulomatous dermatitis (IGD). IGD is a rare condition characterized by granulomatous inflammation in the dermis, often associated with other systemic symptoms. The histopathology findings, including granulomatous inflammation throughout the dermis and mild hyperparakeratosis around a hair follicle, are also consistent with IGD. The presence of well-formed, epithelioid granulomas supports this diagnosis. While sarcoidosis and lymphomatoid granulomatosis can also present with granulomatous inflammation, the absence of other systemic symptoms and the lack of a history of travel or exposure to tuberculosis make IGD a more likely diagnosis. Cutaneous tuberculosis is unlikely given the absence of other signs of tuberculosis infection and the lack of a history of exposure.

Answer: C
Explanation: The clinical presentation of a pruritic, dark red plaque on the eyelid, with histopathological findings of perifollicular lymphocytic infiltrates, exocytosis of atypical lymphocytes into the epithelium, and positive immunohistochemical staining for CD4, CD5, and CD7, are consistent with the diagnosis of unilesional folliculotropic mycosis fungoides (MF). MF is a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that is characterized by the infiltration of malignant T cells into the skin, often with a follicular pattern. The ratio of CD4 to CD8 cells within hair follicles being greater than 7:1 and the presence of monoclonal T-cell gene rearrangement support this diagnosis. Discoid lupus erythematosus (A) is a chronic autoimmune disease that can cause skin lesions, but it typically presents with scaly, round, or oval-shaped lesions, and the histopathological findings are different from those seen in MF. Facial papules in frontal fibrosing alopecia (B) can also cause skin lesions on the eyelid, but the clinical and histopathological features are different from those seen in MF. Jessner lymphocytic infiltrate (D) is a type of cutaneous infiltrate that can occur in various skin conditions, but it does not have the same histopathological features as MF.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's history of follicular lymphoma and the presence of hyperintensity on T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) imaging in the left occipital and temporal lobes, crossing the corpus callosum and extending into the right occipital lobe, are consistent with central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma. The lack of enhancement after contrast administration suggests a non-malignant process, which is consistent with CNS lymphoma. The patient's history of rituximab treatment increases the likelihood of CNS lymphoma. The patient's history of breast cancer increases the possibility of metastatic breast cancer, but the imaging findings do not support this diagnosis. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a possibility, but the imaging findings do not support this diagnosis. A glioma is unlikely given the patient's age and medical history.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's ECG shows an unusual rhythm with a wide QRS complex and a variable PR interval, which suggests the presence of a bundle branch block or a fascicular block. This is unexpected given the patient's recent pacemaker implantation, which should have resulted in a normal sinus rhythm. The most likely explanation for this finding is that the pacemaker leads are not properly positioned or have become dislodged, which can cause abnormal conduction patterns. Therefore, the next step would be to obtain chest radiographs to evaluate the position of the pacemaker leads and ensure that they are properly positioned. This is the most appropriate answer among the options provided, as it addresses the immediate concern of the patient's abnormal ECG and helps to ensure that the pacemaker is functioning properly.

The presence of an obstructive laryngeal mass and the absence of local invasion or lymphadenopathy also support this diagnosis. Bacillary angiomatosis and angiosarcoma are less likely given the absence of fever and the patient's history of treatment-naive HIV and untreated syphilis.

Explanation: The diagnosis is secretory carcinoma. The clinical presentation of a slow-growing, painless parotid nodule, along with the histopathological findings of microcystic and papillary architecture, abundant bubbly secretion, and positive staining for periodic acid–Schiff, S100 protein, and GCDFP-15, are all consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the lack of neoplastic emboli in the peritumoral lymphovascular spaces and the presence of perineural invasion also support this diagnosis. Secretory carcinoma is a rare type of salivary gland carcinoma that typically affects the parotid gland and has a good prognosis. The other options, acinic cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, not otherwise specified, and low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma, can also occur in the parotid gland, but their clinical and histopathological features are not consistent with the case presented.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with uveitis, specifically choroidal infiltration, which can cause vision loss if left untreated. Initiating oral corticosteroids and intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy is a reasonable first step in managing this condition, as it can help reduce inflammation and prevent further vision loss. Topical interferon (option B) may also be considered, but it may not be as effective as corticosteroids and anti-VEGF therapy in this case. Completing serum immunoglobulin level tests, DNA molecular analysis, and bone marrow biopsy (option C) may be necessary to rule out other potential causes of uveitis, but it is not the most urgent step in managing the patient's symptoms. Systemic intravenous rituximab (option D) may be considered in certain cases of uveitis, but it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient given the absence of any systemic symptoms or signs of a hematologic malignancy.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of a progressively enlarging eyelid lesion with associated facial numbness and no improvement with antibiotic therapy suggests a diagnosis of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) of the eyelid. The ulcerated marginal lesion with surrounding edema and erythema, as well as the hypoesthesia in the distribution of the trigeminal maxillary branch, are consistent with VZV. Excisional biopsy (option C) would be the next step to confirm the diagnosis. Wound debridement (option B) may be necessary as well, but biopsy is the more appropriate next step to establish the diagnosis. Continued antibiotic therapy (option A) may not be effective against a viral infection such as VZV, and computed tomography scan of the orbits (option D) is not necessary at this point in the patient's evaluation.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of retinal vasculitis, specifically a branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO) with associated optic neuritis. The presence of disc edema, flame-shaped peripapillary hemorrhages, and retinal whitening in the inferior midperiphery are all consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's history of rapid visual deterioration over a short period of time also supports this diagnosis.

Administering high-dose oral valacyclovir (2 g, 3 times daily) would be an appropriate next step in management, as it is effective in treating herpes simplex virus (HSV) retinitis, which is a common cause of retinal vasculitis. The presence of anterior chamber cell, keratic precipitates, and vitreous cell suggests an inflammatory response, which may be caused by HSV infection.

Administering intramuscular benzathine penicillin G (2.4 million units) would not be an appropriate next step, as it is used to treat bacterial infections, not viral infections such as HSV retinitis.

Administering systemic corticosteroids may be considered in the future, but it is not the most appropriate next step. Corticosteroids are used to reduce inflammation, but they may not be effective in treating the underlying cause of the retinal vasculitis, which is likely to be an HSV infection.

Treating with an intraocular corticosteroid injection would also not be an appropriate next step, as it would not address the underlying cause of the retinal vasculitis. Intraocular corticosteroid injections are typically used to treat inflammation caused by a variety of conditions, including uveitis, but they are not effective in treating HSV retinitis.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a possible diagnosis of bilateral iris cysts. The patient's history of progressive visual obscuration in his left eye and lack of any recent changes in the size or number of the lesions suggest that the cysts may be impacting his vision. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis would be the next appropriate step in the diagnostic workup. The CT scan would help to rule out any systemic causes of the cysts, such as a genetic disorder or a metastatic lesion. It would also help to identify any other potential causes of the patient's visual obscuration, such as a choroidal neovascular membrane or a retinal detachment. Surgical iridectomy (option A) may be considered if the cysts are causing significant visual impairment and are not responding to other treatments, but it is not the next step in the diagnostic workup.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as erythematous papules, crusted lesions, and fissures on the lower lip, are consistent with actinic prurigo cheilitis. The fact that the patient has a history of generalized pruritus and has been treated with topical corticosteroids without relief also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's age and lack of other medical history make actinic prurigo cheilitis a more likely diagnosis than the other options.

Herpes simplex virus-associated pseudolymphoma (A) is an uncommon condition that typically presents with papules, nodules, or tumors on the skin, but it is not typically associated with generalized pruritus or cheilitis.

Cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasia (C) is a condition characterized by an excessive proliferation of lymphoid cells in the skin, leading to the formation of papules, nodules, or tumors. However, it is not typically associated with generalized pruritus or cheilitis.

Marginal zone lymphoma (D) is a type of B-cell lymphoma that typically presents with nodules or tumors in the skin, but it is not typically associated with generalized pruritus or cheilitis.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely diagnosis is actinic prurigo cheilitis (B).

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of angina and dyspnea with exertion, along with the findings of a fixed, severe apical defect and a partially reversible severe anterior wall defect on exercise nuclear stress test, suggest that he has coronary artery disease (CAD) that is likely contributing to his left ventricular dysfunction. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the left anterior descending artery is the most appropriate next step in management, as it can help to improve blood flow to the affected areas of the heart and alleviate symptoms. Coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) may also be considered, but PCI is generally preferred as the first line of intervention, especially in a relatively young patient like this one. Coronary artery reimplantation is not a recognized treatment for CAD, and continuing medical management alone is unlikely to effectively address the patient's symptoms and left ventricular dysfunction.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's presentation of progressive vision loss, gait changes, memory loss, and weight loss, along with the physical examination findings of homonymous hemianopia, asymmetric visual field loss, and gaze-evoked nystagmus, suggests a diagnosis of cortical visual impairment. The absence of any abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) suggests that the cause of the visual symptoms is unlikely to be due to a structural lesion or vascular abnormality.

The patient's history of coronary artery disease, hypothyroidism, and prostate cancer in remission increases the likelihood of a neurodegenerative or metabolic disorder. The presence of mild epiretinal membrane and nuclear sclerosis on fundus examination suggests that the patient may have age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which could contribute to the visual symptoms.

Given the patient's symptoms and examination findings, the most appropriate next step would be to order a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) prion disease panel (Option C) to rule out a prion-related disorder, such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), which can cause rapidly progressive dementia, visual disturbances, and gait abnormalities.

While aspirin therapy for secondary stroke prevention (Option B) may be appropriate for patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), it is not the most appropriate next step in this case given the absence of any acute vascular event or significant cardiovascular risk factors.

Pars plana vitrectomy with vitreous biopsy (Option A) may be considered in cases of suspected vitreoretinal disease, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case given the absence of any vitreoretinal abnormalities on examination and the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggestive of a cortical visual impairment.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of a slowly progressive unilateral blepharoptosis, along with the physical examination findings of a palpable mass and yellow nodular lesion, suggests a diagnosis of a benign tumor such as a papilloma or a dermoid cyst. However, the histopathologic examination results showing amorphous acellular proteinaceous deposits that positively stain with Congo red and exhibit apple-green birefringence under polarized light, are consistent with a diagnosis of amyloidosis. The patient's age and lack of systemic symptoms suggest that this is likely a primary localized amyloidosis, also known as a benign amyloidosis of the eyelid. Therefore, the next step would be to perform a complete excision of the lesion to remove the amyloid deposits and prevent further progression of the blepharoptosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and findings, including bilateral visual acuity loss, photophobia, trace anterior cells, subretinal fluid, and hyperfluorescence on fluorescein angiography, are consistent with central serous retinopathy (CSR). The presence of multifocal, demarcated exudative retinal detachments in both eyes, as shown in Figure 1B, supports this diagnosis. Given the rapid progression of the disease and the presence of vitreous cells, it is appropriate to consider retinal detachment repair with vitrectomy and/or scleral buckle as the next step in management. Initiating immunosuppressive therapy (option A) may be considered in cases of uveitis, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case given the patient's clinical presentation and diagnosis of CSR. Monitoring for resolution of subretinal fluid (option B) may be appropriate in some cases, but given the rapid progression of the disease and the presence of retinal detachments, it is not the most appropriate next step.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's unilateral atrophic hyperpigmentation, strictly following the lines of Blaschko, is consistent with Lichen Striatus. Lichen Striatus is a rare, acquired, linear papulosquamous disorder characterized by the development of discrete, linear, atrophic, and hyperpigmented lesions on the trunk, limbs, and face. The condition typically affects children and young adults, and the lesions may be asymptomatic or pruritic. The etiology of Lichen Striatus is unknown, but it is believed to be associated with immunological dysregulation.The patient's history of a small hyperpigmentation on the right side of her lower chest remaining stable for years, followed by a gradual spreading and intensification of the hyperpigmentation in her early 20s, is consistent with the typical presentation of Lichen Striatus. The lack of response to intravenous penicillin G therapy and UV-A1 phototherapy also supports this diagnosis, as Lichen Striatus is known to be resistant to conventional treatments.The histopathological findings, including a slight hyperpigmentation of the basal epidermis layer and preserved elastic fibers in the reticular dermis, are also consistent with Lichen Striatus.

Answer: C 
Explanation: The patient's history of Parkinson's disease, dependence in all activities of daily living, and the absence of facial flushing suggest that the patient has a low likelihood of having Kaposi sarcoma (A). Elder abuse (B) is also unlikely given the patient's medical history and the absence of any signs of trauma or injury. Telangiectatic metastatic carcinoma (D) is unlikely due to the absence of any known primary cancer and the patient's history of cardiovascular disease. Rosacea-like angiosarcoma (C) is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's history of facial erythema and the clinical and histopathological findings of ectatic vessels with plump endothelia involving the deep dermis and hypodermis, as well as the negative immunohistochemistry for Human herpesvirus 8.

Answer: C
Explanation: Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a prion disease that affects the brain and nervous system, leading to rapidly progressive neurological symptoms, including myoclonus, rigidity, and spasms. The patient's symptoms of worsening spasms in her axial and lower limb muscles, new-onset urinary retention, and myoclonus on tactile and acoustic stimulation, as well as the abnormal mental status, cranial nerve examination results, and symmetric hypertonia and rigidity, are consistent with CJD. Additionally, the patient's history of Hashimoto thyroiditis increases the likelihood of a diagnosis of CJD, as there is an association between autoimmune disorders and prion diseases. The absence of impairment of consciousness during the attacks and the normal protein level and cell counts in the cerebrospinal fluid also support the diagnosis of CJD. The other options, progressive myoclonic epilepsies (PMEs), faciobrachial dystonic seizures, and progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM), can also present with myoclonus and rigidity, but do not fit the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory results as well as CJD.

Answer: B
Explanation: Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (IVLBCL) is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that primarily affects the elderly. It is characterized by the proliferation of large B cells within the blood vessels, leading to vessel wall thickening and occlusion. The patient's symptoms of painful erythematous plaques on the lower legs, tender edema, fever, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase level are consistent with IVLBCL. The high viral load of EBV in the patient's peripheral blood also supports this diagnosis, as EBV is commonly associated with IVLBCL. The skin biopsy findings of dilated vessels filled with atypical large lymphoid cells throughout the dermis are also consistent with IVLBCL.

The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and laboratory results as well as IVLBCL. Erysipelas (option A) is an infection caused by Streptococcus pyogenes that presents with well-defined, raised, red plaques on the skin. Intravascular natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (option C) is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that affects the blood vessels and can cause skin lesions, but it typically presents with more widespread skin involvement and a different clinical picture. Cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis (option D) is a condition characterized by inflammation of the blood vessels in the skin, leading to skin lesions, but it typically does not cause the systemic symptoms and laboratory abnormalities seen in this patient.

Answer: B
Explanation: Performing cardiac catheterization is the next step in managing this patient's condition. The patient's symptoms of worsening dyspnea, lower extremity edema, and elevated brain-type natriuretic peptide level suggest that she may have developed postpartum cardiomyopathy, a condition that can occur in the early postpartum period and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. The patient's history of a complicated delivery, with breached position of the fetus, fetal distress, and new onset of fever, may also contribute to the development of this condition.

The non–electrocardiogram-gated computed tomography angiography did not provide a definitive diagnosis due to motion artifacts, and a transthoracic echocardiogram showed severe aortic regurgitation and a mildly dilated aortic root. These findings suggest that the patient may have a cardiac condition that requires further evaluation and management.

Cardiac catheterization would allow for a more definitive diagnosis of the patient's cardiac condition, including any potential coronary artery disease or other structural abnormalities. It would also allow for the performance of any necessary interventions, such as coronary angioplasty or stenting, to improve the patient's symptoms and prevent long-term complications.

Therefore, option B, Perform cardiac catheterization, is the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's condition.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's history of bilateral corneal verticillata and corneal crystals, along with his previous use of amiodarone, suggests a possible diagnosis of amiodarone-induced keratopathy. However, since the patient has stopped using amiodarone for 10 months prior to presentation, it is likely that the keratopathy has resolved. Therefore, providing reassurance to the patient and monitoring the condition closely would be the appropriate next step. Obtaining genetic testing (option B) may not be necessary at this point, as the patient's symptoms and history suggest a medication-related cause rather than a genetic disorder. Initiating corneal scraping and culture (option C) may not be necessary given the patient's history and lack of symptoms, and laboratory testing for immunoglobulins (option D) may not be relevant to the patient's condition.

Answer: D
Explanation: The patient presents with severe progressive bilateral vision loss, papilledema, and bilateral nonocclusive dural venous sinus thromboses (DVST), which suggests a diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). The patient has already been started on oral acetazolamide, which is the first-line treatment for IIH. However, given the severity of the patient's symptoms and the presence of DVST, it is appropriate to consider more aggressive treatment options, such as drain or shunt placement. Therefore, the next step would be to consult neurosurgery for consideration of these procedures.

Option A, beginning intravenous anticoagulation, may be appropriate for patients with IIH who have a high risk of stroke or have evidence of venous thrombosis, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case.

Option B, serial lumbar punctures, may be considered in patients with IIH who have not responded to medical therapy or have evidence of hydrocephalus, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case given the patient's severe symptoms and DVST.

Option C, immediate optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF), is a surgical procedure that may be considered in patients with severe vision loss due to IIH, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case given the patient's recent presentation and the need for further evaluation and management by neurosurgery.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of painless periorbital swelling and erythema, along with the physical examination findings of proptosis, edema, and chemosis, suggest a possible inflammatory or infectious process. The imaging studies show a large lesion in the right greater wing of the sphenoid bone extending towards the orbital apex, with edema and enhancement of the right temporal lobe of the brain. These findings are consistent with a possible inflammatory or infectious process, such as an abscess or cellulitis, rather than a neoplastic process. Therefore, starting treatment with intravenous corticosteroids (option C) would be an appropriate next step in management, as it could help reduce inflammation and prevent further tissue damage. A positron emission tomographic scan (option A) may also be considered to further evaluate the nature of the lesion, but it would not be the most urgent step in management. Intravenous antibiotics (option B) may also be considered, but the patient's history of recent treatment with oral antibiotics and the lack of clinical improvement suggest that corticosteroids may be a more appropriate choice. Biopsy of the lesion (option D) may also be considered, but it would require a surgical procedure and may not be necessary given the patient's young age and the potential risks associated with the procedure.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's history of genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) and the presence of multinucleated keratinocytes with gray-blue cytoplasm in the biopsy suggest a diagnosis of Herpes vegetans. This condition is caused by the reactivation of HSV infection and is characterized by the formation of painful, ulcerative lesions in the perianal area. The dense inflammatory infiltrate and necrosis in the biopsy also support this diagnosis. Squamous cell carcinoma (option A) is less likely given the absence of significant actinic damage and the presence of multinucleated keratinocytes. CD30-positive primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (option B) is also unlikely due to the absence of CD30 expression in the tumor cells and the lack of other features of lymphoma in the biopsy. Giant condyloma acuminatum (Buschke-Löwenstein tumor) (option D) is not a likely diagnosis given the absence of warty lesions and the presence of necrosis and inflammation in the biopsy.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's history of rapidly evolving necrotic plaques and nodules, as well as the histopathological findings of an epidermotropic infiltrate of hyperchromatic, convoluted, atypical CD3+, CD4−, and CD8+ lymphocytes with haloed nuclei and basilar tagging, are consistent with a diagnosis of primary cutaneous aggressive epidermotropic cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell lymphoma. The patient's lack of clinically appreciable lymphadenopathy and the absence of aberrant T-cell immunophenotypes on blood flow cytometry also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's response to treatment with liposomal doxorubicin, which is typically used to treat CD8+ T-cell lymphomas, further supports this diagnosis.

The other options are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's clinical presentation and histopathological findings. CD8+ mycosis fungoides (option A) typically presents with patches or plaques on the skin that are not ulcerated or necrotic, and the histopathological findings do not typically show the same level of cytologic atypia and pagetoid reticulosis as seen in this case. Lymphomatoid papulosis, type D (option B) typically presents with papules or nodules that are not ulcerated or necrotic, and the histopathological findings do not typically show the same level of cytologic atypia and pagetoid reticulosis as seen in this case. Natural killer/T-cell lymphoma (option D) typically presents with more widespread skin involvement and may have a more aggressive clinical course, but the histopathological findings are not typically similar to those seen in this case.

Answer: C
Explanation:
The correct answer is C, Metastatic carcinoma. The clinical presentation of an enlarging, tender, pruritic, erythematous patch with central inflammatory papules on the forehead, without any inciting events such as arthropod bites or trauma, suggests a possible diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma. The patient's age and lack of other cutaneous abnormalities also support this diagnosis.

The histopathological findings of dissecting vascular channels and spindle cells (Figure B) are consistent with a diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma. The immunohistochemical staining results showing CD31 and diffuse expression of FLI-1 and ERG in the vascular and spindle cell components (Figure C) also support this diagnosis.

Cutaneous B-cell lymphoma (Answer A) is less likely given the absence of characteristic clinical features such as papillomatosis, hyperpigmentation, and lymphadenopathy. Angiosarcoma (Answer B) is also less likely given the absence of characteristic clinical features such as rapid growth, pain, and purpura. Merkel cell carcinoma (Answer D) is unlikely given the absence of characteristic clinical features such as firm, shiny, and painless nodules, and the absence of a history of significant sun exposure.

Answer: D
Explanation: The patient presents with syncope, shortness of breath, and chest pain, which are all symptoms of pulmonary embolism. The laboratory results show elevated troponin and fibrin D-dimer levels, which support the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. The electrocardiogram and computed tomography angiography confirm the diagnosis. The patient's condition is severe, with multiple large bilateral pulmonary emboli and a mobile thrombus extending from the right atrium into the right ventricle. In this case, systemic thrombolysis is the most appropriate treatment option, as it can quickly dissolve the clots and reduce the risk of further complications. Admission to the intensive care unit is also necessary to closely monitor the patient's condition and provide appropriate care. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of persistent daytime fatigue, morning headaches, growth of the tongue and feet, and intermittent swelling with numbness in the hands are consistent with acromegaly, a rare hormonal disorder that can cause excessive growth and enlargement of various body tissues, including the tonsils. The patient's history of severe obstructive sleep apnea and use of CPAP also support this diagnosis, as sleep apnea can be a common comorbidity in patients with acromegaly. The patient's change in bite from an overbite to an underbite may also be related to the growth of the mandible and maxilla, which can occur in acromegaly.

The other options are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and clinical findings. Allergic rhinitis (option A) may cause nasal congestion and fatigue, but it would not explain the patient's oropharyngeal findings or his systemic symptoms. Lymphoma (option C) is a possibility, but it would be less likely based on the patient's symptoms and clinical findings, and would require further diagnostic testing to confirm. Normal anatomic variant (option D) is unlikely, as the patient's symptoms and clinical findings suggest a pathological process is occurring.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and test results suggest a diagnosis of Dianzani autoimmune lymphoproliferative disease (DALD). DALD is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by the proliferation of lymphocytes and histiocytes, leading to the formation of lymphadenopathy and other symptoms. The patient's elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level, as well as the negative results for infectious diseases, are consistent with DALD. The patient's neck mass and the findings on fine-needle aspiration and flow cytometry also support this diagnosis. Rosai-Dorfman disease, Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease, and Castleman disease are all rare lymphoproliferative disorders that can present with similar symptoms, but they have distinct clinical and pathological features that are not consistent with the patient's presentation.

Answer: B
Explanation: A positron emission tomography (PET) scan should be ordered to evaluate the possibility of metastatic disease in the retina, which could explain the sudden onset of multiple green spots in the patient's eyes. The patient's recent initiation of cobimetinib therapy and the hyperautofluorescent lesions observed on fundus autofluorescence suggest a potential association with the breast cancer treatment. The PET scan can help determine if there is any metastatic disease in the retina or elsewhere in the body that may be related to the patient's breast cancer and cobimetinib therapy.

Option A, initiating an oral prednisone course, may not be the most appropriate next step, as it would not address the underlying cause of the retinal lesions.

Option C, discontinuing breast cancer treatment, may also not be the most appropriate next step, as it would not address the potential metastatic disease that may be present in the retina or elsewhere in the body.

Option D, electing observation, may not be the most appropriate next step, as it would not provide any definitive answers or guide management.

Answer: B
Explanation: Obtaining an electroretinogram (ERG) would be the next step in the management of this patient. The patient's symptoms of bilateral reduced central visual acuity, accompanied by bilateral maculopathy with focal areas of gray-brown discoloration and yellow-orange pigmentation, are suggestive of a retinal degeneration. The presence of an intact foveal depression with subfoveal disruption of the ellipsoid layer and hyperreflective material extending into the Henle layer on optical coherence tomography (OCT) supports this diagnosis. An ERG would help in confirming the diagnosis of retinal degeneration and would also help in identifying the type of retinal degeneration. Additionally, it would also help in ruling out other potential causes of central visual loss such as retinal detachment or central serous chorioretinopathy.

Therefore, option B, Obtain an electroretinogram, is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient.

The other options are not appropriate for the following reasons:

Option A, Stop all psychiatric medications, may be considered later if the patient's symptoms are thought to be related to the medications, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this point.

Option C, Inquire about bright light exposures, may be relevant if the patient's symptoms were thought to be related to phototoxicity, but there is no mention of such exposures in the case history.

Option D, Prescribe oral steroids, is not appropriate as there is no indication of inflammation or edema in the retina that would warrant the use of steroids.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of acute-onset visual acuity loss, periorbital pain, and restricted extraocular movements, along with the physical examination findings of an amaurotic pupil, ptosis, and normal intraocular pressures, suggest a diagnosis of orbital cellulitis. The presence of fungal hyphal elements in the sinus biopsy further supports this diagnosis. Orbital cellulitis is a medical emergency that requires prompt treatment to prevent further visual loss.

The best next step would be to perform transcutaneous retrobulbar injection of an antifungal agent, which can provide prompt treatment for the orbital cellulitis and help prevent further visual loss. This approach has been shown to be effective in treating orbital cellulitis and is a common practice in ophthalmology.

Awaiting improvement in renal status and performing contrast-enhanced imaging (Option A) may not be the most appropriate next step, as the patient's renal status may not have a significant impact on the management of the orbital cellulitis. Additionally, contrast-enhanced imaging may not provide any additional information that would change the management of the patient's condition.

Performing orbital debridement (Option C) may be necessary in some cases of orbital cellulitis, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's management. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest that the infection is primarily located in the orbit, and debridement may not be necessary at this time.

Performing orbital exenteration (Option D) is a more invasive procedure that may be necessary in some cases of advanced orbital cellulitis, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's management. The patient's symptoms and examination findings do not suggest that the infection has spread to the extent that would require exenteration.

PTTM is a rare condition characterized by the growth of tumor cells within the small pulmonary vessels, leading to occlusion and fibrosis. The patient's history of lung adenocarcinoma and the presence of para-aortic and inguinal lymphadenopathies suggest a possible primary tumor. The absence of thromboembolisms on contrast-enhanced computed tomography and the presence of extramammary Paget disease on autopsy support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase level and severe tricuspid regurgitation are consistent with PTTM. Therefore, option C is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's presentation of pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, and syncope, along with the physical examination findings of elevated jugular venous pressure, Kussmaul sign, and distant heart sounds, suggest a possible cardiac tamponade. The echocardiography results, which show a large circumferential pericardial effusion and diastolic right ventricular collapse, further support this diagnosis. The patient's history of polycystic kidney disease and previous surgical interventions, including the placement of an IVC stent, increase the likelihood that the effusion is caused by a complication related to the stent. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to refer the patient for urgent vascular surgery to remove the IVC stent, which is causing the cardiac tamponade. This would help to relieve the pressure on the heart and improve the patient's symptoms. The other options, including urgent referral for cardiovascular surgery, pericardiocentesis with pericardial drain placement, and initiation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and colchicine, may also be considered, but they are not as urgent or directly addressing the likely cause of the patient's symptoms as the chosen option.

The patient's history of reactive airway disease and eczema also support this diagnosis, as IgG4-related disease is known to affect patients with a history of allergic conditions. The negative results of the infectious workup, including the negative culture and negative stains for infectious organisms, also support this diagnosis, as IgG4-related disease is not caused by an infectious agent. The mixed inflammatory infiltrate and increased plasma cell component revealed by flow cytometry are also consistent with IgG4-related disease. Finally, the full-body nuclear magnetic resonance positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan ruling out systemic disease also supports this diagnosis, as IgG4-related disease is typically a localized process.

Answer: C
Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of nasal pain, facial pain, and tenderness to the external nose, along with the physical examination findings of a submucosal, round, firm, tender lesion on the right anterior nasal septum, are consistent with a diagnosis of hemangiopericytoma. This type of vascular tumor typically affects the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses and presents with non-specific symptoms such as nasal congestion, headaches, and facial pain. The patient's history of allergic rhinitis and previous treatment with fluticasone and loratadine also support this diagnosis, as hemangiopericytoma can mimic the symptoms of allergic rhinitis.

The other options are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Glomus tumor (option A) is a rare type of nasal tumor that typically affects the nasal cavity and is characterized by a glomus-like appearance on histopathology. Inverted papilloma (option B) is a benign tumor that arises from the nasal cavity and is typically associated with unilateral nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, and bleeding.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as nasal polyps, dysphonia, and subglottic stenosis, are consistent with rhinoscleroma. Additionally, the presence of vacuolated macrophages with bacilli and eosinophilic inclusions within plasma cells in the laryngeal mass biopsy results supports this diagnosis. Rhinoscleroma is a rare, chronic granulomatous disease that affects the upper aerodigestive tract and is caused by the bacterium Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis. It is commonly seen in tropical and subtropical regions, which fits with the patient's history of emigration from Guatemala. While granulomatosis with polyangiitis and sarcoidosis can also present with similar symptoms, the presence of nasal polyps and the specific histopathological findings in the laryngeal mass biopsy are more consistent with rhinoscleroma. Amyloidosis can also cause nasal polyps, but it is less likely given the patient's age and the presence of subglottic stenosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The clinical presentation of a diffuse palatal swelling, with no pain or discomfort, and the absence of any extraoral signs, suggests a benign or low-grade malignant lesion. The histopathological features of sheets of large lymphocytes with a moderate amount of cytoplasm and round to oval nuclei containing vesicular chromatin and 2 to 3 small nucleoli, along with the positive staining for CD20, CD79, CD21, BCL6, and BCL2, support the diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). DLBCL is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that typically affects older adults and often presents with localized or generalized lymphadenopathy. The absence of any significant bone marrow or peripheral blood involvement, as well as the lack of systemic symptoms, suggests that this is an early-stage disease. The patient should be further managed with radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy, and close follow-up is necessary to monitor for any signs of recurrence or progression.

The patient's history of thyroid cancer and radiation therapy increases the likelihood of a genetic disorder. It is important to obtain a family medical history and pursue genetic testing to determine the underlying cause of the retinal degeneration. This information will guide further management and counseling for the patient.

While initiating AREDS nutritional supplement treatment for age-related macular degeneration (Option A) may be appropriate for the patient's age-related macular changes, it does not address the underlying cause of the retinal pigment abnormalities. Monitoring the retinal pigment abnormalities without further workup (Option B) is not appropriate given the patient's history of thyroid cancer and radiation therapy. Referring for intensification of oral therapy for type 2 diabetes (Option D) may be appropriate, but it does not address the retinal pigment abnormalities or the patient's history of thyroid cancer.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as recurrent redness and photophobia, diffuse conjunctival hyperemia, anterior chamber cell, and vascularized iris infiltrate, are consistent with ocular juvenile xanthogranuloma (OJXG). The negative results of the dilated fundus examination and the absence of skin lesions suggest that this is an isolated ocular manifestation of the disease. The patient's age, 19 years old, is also consistent with the typical age range for OJXG.

Anterior chamber paracentesis for viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) would be the appropriate next step in the management of this patient. This test can help identify the presence of viral DNA in the aqueous humor, which is a common feature of OJXG. The results of the PCR can help guide further management, such as the use of antiviral medication or surgical intervention.

Biopsy of the iris lesion (option A) may be considered, but it is not the most appropriate next step. While biopsy can provide a definitive diagnosis, it carries a risk of complications, such as bleeding, inflammation, and vision loss. In addition, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are already consistent with OJXG, making biopsy less necessary.

Administering subtenon corticosteroid injection (option B) may provide temporary relief of the patient's symptoms, but it is not a definitive treatment for OJXG. Corticosteroids can reduce inflammation, but they do not address the underlying cause of the disease.

Screening for antinuclear antibody (option D) is not relevant to the patient's symptoms or diagnosis. While ANA is sometimes associated with OJXG, it is not a diagnostic criterion, and testing for it is not necessary at this point in the patient's management.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and findings on EGD suggest a diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), an inflammatory condition characterized by the presence of eosinophils in the esophageal tissue. The next step in management would be to perform esophageal high-resolution manometry (HRM) to assess the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and esophageal motility, as abnormalities in these functions can contribute to the development of EoE. HRM is a non-invasive test that provides detailed information about the pressure and movement of the esophageal muscles, which can help guide treatment decisions.

Therefore, option B (Perform esophageal high-resolution manometry) is the correct answer.

Option A (Order barium esophagram) may be considered, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management, as it would not provide information about the esophageal motility and LES function, which are important in the diagnosis and management of EoE.

Option C (Prescribe omeprazole) may be considered, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management, as proton pump inhibitors are not effective in treating EoE.

Option D (Refer for surgical fundoplication) is not appropriate at this stage, as surgical intervention is not indicated based on the patient's symptoms and findings on EGD.

Answer: C
Explanation:
The patient's history of median sternotomy and coronary artery bypass surgery, along with the presence of a well-demarcated, circular erythematous plaque with raised erythematous margins and studded with numerous blisters and pustules, suggests a diagnosis of linear IgA dermatosis (LAD). LAD is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by the deposition of IgA antibodies in the skin, leading to the formation of blisters and pustules. The linear arrangement of the lesions in this case, as well as the absence of oral, ocular, and genital mucosa involvement, are consistent with LAD. The negative results of Gram stain, periodic acid–Schiff stain, and tissue culture support this diagnosis, as LAD is not associated with bacterial or fungal infection.

Annular pustular psoriasis (option A) is a type of psoriasis that presents with circular or ring-shaped lesions, but it typically has a longer duration and is associated with scaling and thickening of the skin, which is not seen in this case. Bullous tinea (option B) is a fungal infection that can cause blisters and pustules, but it typically occurs in warm, moist areas of the body and is not associated with a history of median sternotomy. Acute localized exanthematous pustulosis (option D) is a rare condition characterized by the sudden onset of pustules on a red base, but it is usually associated with a history of medication use or infection, and there is no evidence of this in the patient's history.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation of progressive skin thickening and subcutaneous enlargement of the right side of her nose and right cheek, as well as the histopathological findings of interstitial proliferation of spindle cells within mature adipocytes and fragments of thickened collagen, are consistent with a diagnosis of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP). DFSP is a rare soft tissue sarcoma that typically presents as a slow-growing, painless mass in the skin or subcutaneous tissue. It is characterized by a proliferation of spindle cells that infiltrate and disrupt the normal architecture of the soft tissue, often with areas of adipocyte differentiation. The spindle cells are typically positive for vimentin and negative for cytokeratin, which can help distinguish DFSP from other soft tissue tumors. The patient's history of recurrence after surgical excision and the presence of deviation of the nasal tip also support the diagnosis of DFSP. Lupus panniculitis (subcutaneous lupus erythematosus) (A) is an autoimmune disease that can cause skin thickening and subcutaneous nodules, but it typically does not involve the nasal tip and does not have the same histopathological features as DFSP. Spindle cell lipoma (B) is a rare benign tumor of adipose tissue that can have a similar appearance to DFSP, but it typically lacks the areas of adipocyte differentiation and has a more uniform population of spindle cells. Diffuse pattern neurofibroma (D) is a rare variant of neurofibroma that can cause skin thickening and pigmentation, but it typically does not involve the nasal tip and does not have the same histopathological features as DFSP.

Answer: C
Explanation: Bullous mastocytosis is a rare condition characterized by the development of multiple bullae and vesicles on the skin, often accompanied by pruritus and erythema. The condition is caused by an abnormal accumulation of mast cells in the skin, which can lead to the release of histamine and other chemical mediators, resulting in the formation of blisters. The clinical presentation of bullous mastocytosis in this case, including the recurrent blistering and involvement of the face, hands, and feet, is consistent with the diagnosis. Additionally, the histopathological findings of a subepidermal bulla with a band-like mast cell infiltrate in the upper dermis, as well as the dense infiltrate of mast cells in the upper dermis, support the diagnosis of bullous mastocytosis.

The other options do not fit the clinical presentation and histopathological findings of this case. Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (option A) is a genetic disorder characterized by fragile skin and mucous membranes, leading to blistering and skin erosions. While blistering is present in this case, the absence of skin fragility and mucous membrane involvement argues against this diagnosis. Chronic bullous disease of childhood (option B) is a rare condition characterized by the development of large, tense bullae on the skin, often accompanied by fever and respiratory symptoms. While the bullae in this case are tense and angulated, the absence of fever and respiratory symptoms argues against this diagnosis. Congenital erythropoietic porphyria (option D) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the accumulation of porphyrins in the skin, leading to blistering and scarring. While blistering is present in this case, the absence of other characteristic features of congenital erythropoietic porphyria, such as photosensitivity and scarring, argues against this diagnosis.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient presents with symptoms of schizophrenia, including auditory hallucinations, paranoia, and disorganized thinking. Oral olanzapine is an antipsychotic medication that is approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and has a lower risk of extrapyramidal side effects compared to other antipsychotics. It is appropriate to consider the risk of adverse events when selecting a treatment option, but in this case, the patient's symptoms and history of schizophrenia suggest that medication is the most appropriate next step. Cognitive behavioral therapy for psychosis (CBTp) may also be beneficial, but it is typically used in conjunction with medication, rather than as a standalone treatment. Oral clozapine is another antipsychotic medication that may be considered for treatment-resistant schizophrenia, but it has a higher risk of adverse effects and requires regular blood monitoring, making it a less appropriate choice for this patient at this time.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a hematologic disease, and the imaging studies show diffuse hypercaptation in the bone marrow and spleen, which is consistent with bone marrow involvement. The bone-marrow biopsy results show a diffuse infiltrate of large lymphoid cells with scattered residual hematopoietic elements, which is consistent with a diagnosis of lymphoma. The patient's history of recurrent seronegative autoimmune constrictive pericarditis and pleural effusions, as well as the presence of lymphoplasmacytic aggregates in the pericardium, suggest that the lymphoma may be of the B-cell type. The patient's age and clinical presentation also support this diagnosis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is B: Bone marrow–liver–spleen type of large B-cell lymphoma.

In this scenario, it would be appropriate to perform ambulatory cardiac monitoring after electrolyte repletion to assess the patient's rhythm and determine if there is any evidence of an underlying arrhythmia that may require further intervention. Coronary angiography (Option A) may be necessary in the future, but it is not the most appropriate next step given the patient's presentation and recent cardioversion. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (Option C) may also be considered in the future, but it is not as urgent as ambulatory cardiac monitoring. Invasive electrophysiology study (Option D) is typically reserved for cases where there is a clear indication of a specific arrhythmia that requires ablation or other interventional procedures, and is not the most appropriate next step in this case.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of stridor and respiratory distress, along with the physical examination findings of a large flesh-colored laryngeal mass, are consistent with a lateral saccular cyst. This type of cyst is a rare congenital abnormality that can occur in the larynx and can cause airway obstruction. The fact that the mass was soft and fluctuant on palpation and that it involved the left side of the epiglottis, false fold, aryepiglottic fold, and arytenoid also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the normal chest radiography result suggests that the cyst is not causing any significant respiratory obstruction. The other options, granular cell tumor, laryngeal neurofibroma, and macrocystic lymphatic malformation, can also cause laryngeal masses but are less likely given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in the left parotid gland, followed by development of a second primary tumor in the hypopharynx, suggests a high likelihood of a squamous cell carcinoma diagnosis. The patient's symptoms of new-onset headaches, left ear pain, and persistent unsteadiness, along with the absence of palpable lymphadenopathy, neurological deficits, or mastoid tenderness, are consistent with a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma. The magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomographic imaging results showing an enhancing lesion in the left infratemporal fossa and osseous destruction of the left temporal bone, respectively, further support this diagnosis. Additionally, the histopathologic assessment demonstrating myogenin-positive spindle cells with no tumor necrosis, and the tumor's expression of desmin-positive and CD34-positive cells, are consistent with squamous cell carcinoma. Therefore, option C, Squamous cell carcinoma, is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation:
The clinical presentation of a subcutaneous nodule in the midline anterior neck of an infant, with a yellow tint and scattered telangiectatic vessels on dermoscopy, is consistent with a cutaneous bronchogenic cyst. These cysts are rare congenital malformations that originate from abnormal development of the embryonic bronchial apparatus. They typically present as a small, mobile, subcutaneous nodule in the neck or thorax, and may have a yellow or orange tint due to lipid accumulation. The absence of pain, pruritus, or discharge, and the lack of tracking into deeper layers of subcutaneous tissue or fluid collection on ultrasonography, also support this diagnosis. Eruptive vellus hair cysts, thyroglossal duct cysts, and midline anterior neck inclusion cysts can also present as subcutaneous nodules in the neck, but their clinical and histopathological features are distinct from cutaneous bronchogenic cysts. Therefore, option C is the most appropriate answer.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as a slowly enlarging mass in the right neck, pain that radiates to the back of the neck, headaches, and intermittent dysphagia, are consistent with a diagnosis of angiolipoma. Angiolipomas are benign tumors that are composed of blood vessels and fat cells, and they can cause symptoms due to their size and location. The patient's history of polycystic ovarian syndrome and insulin resistance may also be relevant to the patient's overall health and potential treatment plan, but they are not directly related to the likely diagnosis of angiolipoma. The patient's migraine disorder could potentially be related to the angiolipoma, as some cases of migraine have been associated with angiolipomas. The patient's age and gender also do not contradict the diagnosis of angiolipoma, as it can occur at any age and is more common in women.

The other options are less likely:

* Liposarcoma is a malignant tumor that arises from fat cells, and it is not typically associated with the patient's symptoms or medical history.
* Hibernoma is a rare benign tumor that is composed of brown fat, and it is not typically associated with the patient's symptoms or medical history.
* Lipoma is a benign tumor that is composed of fat cells, and it is not typically associated with the patient's symptoms or medical history.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for the patient is angiolipoma.

Explanation: The patient's sudden vision loss, bilateral choroidal effusions, and intraretinal hemorrhages are indicative of a possible central nervous system (CNS) vasculitis, which can be a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). The presence of neutropenic fever and recent initiation of chemotherapy increase the likelihood of an infectious etiology. Therefore, it is crucial to rule out any CNS infection or inflammation. Ordering an MRI of the brain and orbits with and without contrast and a lumbar puncture is the most appropriate next step to evaluate the patient's symptoms and determine the underlying cause of his vision loss. This will help guide further management and ensure prompt treatment to prevent any potential long-term visual sequelae.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with acute retinal necrosis (ARN), a severe and sight-threatening infection that can occur in immunocompromised patients. The patient's history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and recent autologous bone marrow transplant suggest that he is immunocompromised. The presence of keratic precipitates, vitritis, and granular necrotizing retinitis on examination support the diagnosis of ARN.

Intravitreal foscarnet is a broad-spectrum antiviral medication that is effective against a wide range of viruses, including herpes simplex virus (HSV), which is the most common cause of ARN. Administering intravitreal foscarnet is a reasonable first step in treating this patient's ARN, as it can help to reduce the severity of the infection and prevent further vision loss.

Admitting the patient for intravenous acyclovir is also appropriate, as acyclovir is an antiviral medication that is effective against HSV and can help to treat the underlying infection. Intravenous acyclovir is often used in combination with intravitreal foscarnet to treat ARN, as it can help to reduce the severity of the infection and prevent further vision loss.

The other options are not as appropriate for several reasons. Administering intravitreal clindamycin (option A) may not be effective against HSV, which is the most likely cause of ARN in this patient. Administering an intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor agent (option D) is not appropriate for treating ARN, as it is used to treat conditions such as age-related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy. Initiating valganciclovir (option C) may be appropriate, but it is not as urgent as administering intravitreal foscarnet and intravenous acyclovir, as valganciclovir takes longer to take effect.

Answer: B: Perform a complete excisional biopsy of the lesion
Explanation: The patient's history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) with transformation to large B-cell lymphoma, previous treatment with rituximab, adriamycin, vincristine sulfate, and prednisone chemotherapy, and recent bladder cancer diagnosis and treatment with intravesical BCG immunotherapy, suggest a high likelihood of a malignant lesion. The lack of response to oral prednisone therapy also supports this suspicion. Given the location and size of the lesion, as well as the patient's history, a complete excisional biopsy is the most appropriate next step to determine the diagnosis and guide further management. Intralesional corticosteroids (option A) may be considered for a presumed inflammatory lesion, but are less likely to be effective for a malignant tumor. Topical antibiotics (option C) would not be effective for a malignant lesion, and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits (option D) may be considered later if the diagnosis is confirmed to be a malignant lymphoma.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's presentation of infectious keratitis in both eyes, with a history of herpes simplex keratitis and previous corneal perforation, suggests a high likelihood of a bacterial and/or viral infection. The positive bacterial cultures for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli support this diagnosis. Therefore, starting topical antibiotics (option A) and oral antiviral therapy (option B) would not be sufficient, as they would not effectively treat the bacterial infection. Option D, admitting the patient for intravenous antiviral therapy, may be necessary if the infection is severe and not responding to other treatments, but it is likely that the patient would first be treated with topical and/or oral antibiotics before considering intravenous antiviral therapy. Therefore, the best option would be to start oral antibiotics and topical antibiotic therapy (option C), which would effectively treat both the bacterial and viral components of the infection.

The patient's history of immigration from Micronesia and lack of travel overseas since then suggests that she may have been exposed to the parasite in her home country. The presence of eosinophilia and elevated liver enzymes also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the linear filling defect in the common bile duct and the presence of worms within the biliary trees seen on endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) confirm the diagnosis. Therefore, it is appropriate to order a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for Ascaris to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of a pruriginous, reddish nodule on the earlobe, with a smooth, superficial appearance and small dimples, is consistent with angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia (ALHE). The histopathologic findings of mixed diffuse dermatitis involving the reticular dermis, with small-vessel vasculitis, characteristic sparing of a superficial dermal grenz zone, and mixed leukocytic infiltrate with eosinophils, lymphocytes, and neutrophils involving the full thickness of the vessel wall, are also consistent with ALHE. The absence of pain and the lack of a relevant medical history further support this diagnosis. Sweet syndrome (option A) is a possibility, but the absence of a painful, tender, or bruised lesion and the lack of a history of systemic symptoms make it less likely. Extrafacial granuloma faciale (option B) typically presents with a firm, painless nodule on the face, and the histopathologic findings are different from those seen in ALHE. Leishmaniasis (option D) is a parasitic infection that can cause skin lesions, but the clinical and histopathologic findings are not consistent with this diagnosis.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of seizures, altered consciousness, and facial flushing, along with the physical examination findings of clubbing and papilledema, suggest a possible diagnosis of a pyogenic brain abscess. The presence of a nodular shadow in the left middle field of the lung on chest radiography and the absence of any meningeal signs also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the MRI findings of ring-enhancing lesions in the right frontal and left parietal cortexes, along with surrounding brain edema and mass effects, are consistent with a pyogenic brain abscess. The patient's history of being a vegetarian, nonsmoker, and nondrinker, and his lack of a history of fever, head trauma, limb weakness, or vomiting, also suggest that the abscess is likely to be pyogenic rather than neoplastic.

Answer: C
Explanation: Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the brain and tendons. It is caused by a deficiency of the enzyme sterol-CoA desmethylase (SCD), which results in the accumulation of cholesteryl esters and triglycerides in various tissues, including the brain and tendons. The clinical presentation of CTX typically includes cognitive decline, behavioral changes, and painless masses in the tendons. The patient's symptoms of indifference, glassy eyes, lethargy, poor memory, and personality change are consistent with the cognitive decline seen in CTX. The patient's painless masses in the Achilles tendons are also consistent with the tendon xanthomas that are characteristic of CTX. The patient's elevated triglyceride level and the presence of abnormal signals in the brain and ankle joints on MRI are also consistent with CTX. Genetic testing revealed a known pathogenic mutation in the CYP27A1 gene, which codes for SCD, supporting the diagnosis of CTX. Therefore, answer C is the correct diagnosis.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of dyspnea, orthopnea, and tachypnea, along with the echocardiogram findings of a normal left ventricular ejection fraction and an echogenic band traversing the apical portion of the left ventricle, suggest the possibility of a cardiac condition. The patient's history of hereditary spherocytosis, polycythemia vera, hemochromatosis, and hypereosinophilia increases the likelihood of a genetic disorder affecting the heart. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would be the most appropriate next step in diagnosing the underlying condition, as it can provide detailed information on cardiac structure and function, as well as identify any potential genetic disorders affecting the heart. Endomyocardial biopsy may also be considered, but MRI is a less invasive and more comprehensive diagnostic tool. A whole-body positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan may be useful in identifying any potential metastatic disease, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. Genetic testing for noncompaction may also be considered, but it is not as urgent as the need for an immediate diagnosis and treatment plan.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and pathologic results are consistent with a diagnosis of laryngeal granuloma. The patient's history of hoarseness and the presence of a hemorrhagic-appearing polyp on stroboscopy suggest a vocal fold lesion. The pathologic results reveal spindle-shaped cells with variable atypia, inflammatory cells, and a myxomatous and focally fibrous-appearing stroma, which are consistent with a granuloma. Additionally, the negative staining for desmin, S100, P63, and cytokeratin and the positive staining for vimentin and ALK1 support this diagnosis. Spindle cell carcinoma (option A) is a malignant tumor that can arise in the larynx, but it typically has a more aggressive clinical course and would be unlikely to show the same pathologic features as seen in this case. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (option B) is a rare benign tumor that can occur in the larynx, but it typically has a more characteristic clinical and pathologic appearance.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and test results indicate that the mass is an infantile hemangioma. The irregular borders and infiltration into the paraspinal musculature seen on the magnetic resonance imaging study suggest that the mass is not a benign tumor such as a lipoma (option A). The patient's age and the presence of multiple small nucleoli surrounded by a pale eosinophilic and slightly fibrillary stroma on histologic examination also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the diffuse positivity for glial fibrillary acidic protein and vimentin, and focal positivity for S100, NeuN, and synaptophysin on immunohistochemical studies, are consistent with an infantile hemangioma. Rhabdomyosarcoma (option B) is a malignant tumor that can occur in childhood, but it typically presents with a different clinical picture and histologic features.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of isolated dysphagia and dysphonia, along with the laryngoscopic examination findings of right vocal cord paralysis, suggest a diagnosis of posttraumatic central motor impairment. The patient's history of severe head trauma and the presence of a right frontal epidural hematoma on CT scan suggest that the cause of the dysphagia and dysphonia is likely related to the trauma. Additionally, the fact that the patient's symptoms developed on postoperative day 2, after the hematoma had been evacuated, suggests that the cause is not related to the hematoma itself, but rather to a secondary effect of the trauma. Posttraumatic central motor impairment is a known complication of head trauma, and it is characterized by weakness or paralysis of the muscles innervated by the cranial nerves, including the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which is responsible for controlling the vocal cords. The presence of thrombosis of the right sigmoid-jugular complex, which causes acute compression of the recurrent nerve, supports this diagnosis. Therefore, option C is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C 
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as a painless, pruritic mass behind the right ear, and the presence of eosinophilia, are consistent with Kimura disease. The T1-weighted postcontrast magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck showed a heterogeneously enhancing mass with irregular borders in the right retroauricular space, which is also consistent with Kimura disease. Additionally, the excised mass was an enlarged lymph node with a smooth, pale core and no hemorrhage or necrosis, which is consistent with Kimura disease. The presence of reactive follicular hyperplasia with prominent eosinophilia in the interfollicular areas and within follicles, forming eosinophilic microabscesses and follicular cysts, supports the diagnosis of Kimura disease. The absence of hemorrhage or necrosis and the presence of only a few small and ill-defined granulomas also support the diagnosis of Kimura disease over Hodgkin lymphoma. Mastoiditis would be unlikely given the absence of ear pain, fever, and recent illnesses. Brachial cleft cyst would also be unlikely given the location of the mass and the absence of a fistula into the external auditory canal.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of relapsing optic neuropathy and multiple cranial neuropathies, along with the imaging findings of thickening and enhancement of both optic nerves, cranial nerve III, V, and the pituitary infundibulum, suggest a diagnosis of autoimmune-related inflammatory disease. The absence of any infectious or malignant etiology, as suggested by the normal MRI, CT scan, and PET/CT scan, supports this diagnosis. The patient's history of breast cancer and treatment with letrozole may also suggest a possible association with autoimmune disorders.

Therefore, the next step would be to repeat the magnetic resonance imaging of the brain (B) to further evaluate the extent and activity of the inflammatory process. This would help guide further management and treatment decisions, such as the use of corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications.

Administering high-dose corticosteroids (A) may be considered, but it is not the most appropriate next step, as the patient's symptoms and imaging findings suggest a more chronic and relapsing condition, and corticosteroids may not address the underlying cause. Repeating the whole-body positron emission tomography scan (C) may not provide additional useful information, as the patient's symptoms and imaging findings are primarily related to the central nervous system. Repeating the testing for angiotensin-converting enzyme in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (D) may be considered, but it is not the most relevant test for this patient's presentation.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of recurrent blepharedema, ptosis, erythema, photophobia, mucopurulent discharge, and knifelike pain suggest a chronic conjunctivitis. The presence of a pseudomembrane on the tarsal conjunctiva and the culture results of gram-negative Serratia marcescens support this diagnosis. Given the patient's history of corneal stem-cell deficiency and cataract, it is likely that the chronic conjunctivitis is caused by a dysfunction in the lacrimal system. Sweeping the superior fornix (option C) would help to remove any debris or inflammatory material that may be contributing to the chronic conjunctivitis. This procedure would also help to improve the patient's symptoms of blepharedema and ptosis. Starting treatment with systemic steroids (option A) may help to reduce inflammation, but it would not address the underlying cause of the chronic conjunctivitis. Performing a dacryocystorhinostomy (option B) may be necessary if the patient's lacrimal system is found to be obstructed, but it would not be the most appropriate next step in this case. Performing a canaliculotomy (option D) may also be necessary if the lacrimal system is found to be obstructed, but it would not address the underlying cause of the chronic conjunctivitis.

Answer: D
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of a chalazion, which is a chronic inflammatory condition of the eyelid. The presence of a black-pigmented nodule on the eyelid margin, associated madarosis, eyelid margin notching, and telangiectasia, are all consistent with this diagnosis.

Option A, treating the patient with hot compresses and an antibiotic-steroid ointment, may provide some symptomatic relief, but it is not a definitive treatment for a chalazion.

Option B, performing an incision and drainage, may be necessary if the chalazion becomes severely inflamed or infected, but it is not the first line of treatment.

Option C, providing a corticosteroid injection, may be considered in some cases, but it is not the most appropriate treatment for a chalazion.

Option D, performing a full-thickness eyelid resection with intraoperative control of margins, is the most appropriate treatment for a chalazion that is persistent or recurrent, as it allows for complete removal of the affected tissue and reduces the risk of recurrence.

Answer: D: Order additional coagulation tests (thrombin time, platelet function assay)
Explanation: The patient's history of recurrent venous thromboembolism, peripheral edema, hematomas, ecchymosis, petechiae, and perifollicular purpura on both lower extremities, and low folic acid level suggest a bleeding disorder. The normal platelet count, PT, APTT, and international normalized ratio rule out a platelet disorder or coagulopathy caused by liver disease. The low folic acid level may indicate a deficiency in vitamin B12, which can cause a bleeding disorder. Therefore, it is appropriate to order additional coagulation tests such as thrombin time and platelet function assay to evaluate the patient's coagulation status and identify any potential bleeding disorders. Bone marrow biopsy (option A) may be necessary later to diagnose a bleeding disorder, but it is not the next step. Prothrombin complex concentrate (option B) is not indicated as the patient's coagulation tests are normal. Vitamin C supplementation (option C) may be beneficial for the patient's hypertension, but it is not directly related to the patient's bleeding symptoms.

Explanation: The patient's current INR of 3.7 is within the therapeutic range of 2.0 to 3.0, indicating that the patient's warfarin dosing is appropriate. Therefore, the best course of action would be to continue the current warfarin dosing and perform a point-of-care INR test in 1 week to monitor the patient's INR and ensure that it remains within the therapeutic range. Option B, skipping 2 doses of warfarin, may not be appropriate as it could lead to a decrease in the patient's INR, potentially increasing the risk of thrombosis. Option C, reducing the weekly dosage by 10%, may also not be appropriate as it could lead to a decrease in the patient's INR.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient has a history of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) and has been experiencing palpitations and tachycardia again, along with symptoms of a viral infection such as sore throat, fever, and myalgias. The patient's ECG shows a narrow complex tachycardia, which is consistent with SVT. The failure of a modified Valsalva maneuver to convert the rhythm and the response to adenosine and direct current cardioversion also support this diagnosis. Given the patient's history and the persistent arrhythmia despite previous treatment, it is likely that the patient has developed a recurrent SVT. Therefore, the best next step would be to switch to intravenous esmolol drip, which is a beta blocker that can effectively convert SVT and has a shorter onset of action compared to oral beta blockers. Repeating direct current cardioversion at 200 J (option B) may be effective in terminating the arrhythmia, but it carries a risk of recurrence, and the patient's history and presentation suggest a higher likelihood of SVT. Stopping diltiazem drip and administering intravenous amiodarone (option A) may also be effective, but amiodarone has a longer onset of action compared to esmolol and may not be as effective in converting SVT. Stopping diltiazem drip and administering intravenous verapamil (option D) is not a suitable option as verapamil is a calcium channel blocker and may not be effective in converting SVT.

Answer: C
Explanation: The correct answer is C, Elastosis perforans serpiginosa. The given clinical case describes a middle-aged woman with mildly pruritic coalescent yellowish papules around the umbilicus. The dermoscopic examination shows curvilinear brown pigment lines (black arrowhead) with accentuation of normal pigmentary network (green box) without follicular plugging (red circle) or linear vessels. The histopathological examination reveals clumped eosinophilic elastic fibers (asterisk) in the middermis. These findings are consistent with Elastosis perforans serpiginosa, a rare benign elastic tissue disorder characterized by the presence of small, discrete, yellowish or pinkish papules, usually located on the trunk, with a predilection for the umbilical region. The condition is often associated with obesity, as in this case. The other options do not match the clinical and histopathological features described in the case. Option A, Periumbilical pseudoxanthoma elasticum, is a rare condition characterized by the presence of yellowish or pinkish papules or plaques on the umbilical region, but it typically shows a different histopathological picture, with a prominent inflammatory infiltrate and absence of elastosis. Option B, Periumbilical pseudoxanthoma elasticum–like papillary dermal elastolysis, is a rare condition that shares some clinical and histopathological features with Elastosis perforans serpiginosa, but it typically presents with larger, more numerous papules, and shows a different dermoscopic pattern, with a "ropy" appearance. Option D, Late-onset focal dermal elastosis, is a rare condition characterized by the presence of small, discrete, yellowish or pinkish papules on the trunk, but it typically affects older adults and shows a different histopathological picture, with a prominent accumulation of elastin in the dermis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The clinical presentation of an asymptomatic, enlarging, partly infiltrated erythematous cutaneous patch localized to the periareolar area of the breast, along with the histopathological findings of a dense dermal infiltrate of cells with focal epidermis involvement and large atypical cells with scanty cytoplasm, is consistent with a diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma. This type of cancer is known to commonly present as a flesh-colored or red, raised, and sometimes ulcerated nodule on the skin, particularly on the face, neck, and extremities. The patient's age and lack of symptoms also support this diagnosis. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (option A) typically affects younger patients and presents with skin lesions that are more papular and have a characteristic "sandpaper" texture. Primary cutaneous large B-cell lymphoma, leg type (option B) would be unlikely given the absence of adenopathies, hepatosplenomegaly, or other remarkable findings on physical examination, as well as the lack of palpable breast masses. Cutaneous angiosarcoma (option D) is a rare malignancy that typically presents as a rapidly growing, painful, and purple-red nodule on the skin, often with a history of trauma. The patient's lack of symptoms and the absence of any remarkable findings on physical examination make this diagnosis less likely.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of involuntary orofaciolingual movements, dysphagia, dysarthria, and involuntary tongue- and lip-biting, as well as the presence of acanthocytes in the blood smear, are consistent with chorea-acanthocytosis. This is a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the VPS13A gene, which codes for a protein involved in membrane trafficking and autophagy. The patient's age of onset, progression of symptoms, and absence of neuropsychiatric symptoms or seizures also support this diagnosis. The patient's mild cognitive decline and normal laboratory test results, including normal cerebrospinal fluid examination, are also consistent with chorea-acanthocytosis. The patient's gait disturbance and mild ataxia may be related to the choreatic movements. The patient's low-density lipoprotein and apolipoprotein B levels were slightly decreased, which may be related to the patient's chorea-acanthocytosis. The patient's marked bilateral caudate head atrophy on cerebral magnetic resonance imaging is consistent with chorea-acanthocytosis, as this is a common finding in patients with this disorder.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of recurrent stroke, along with the abnormal chest radiography findings, suggest the possibility of a cardiac source of embolism. Prolonged Holter monitoring (option C) would be the most appropriate next step to assess for any arrhythmic or conduction abnormalities that may be contributing to the patient's stroke risk. This is particularly important given the patient's history of sick sinus syndrome and the presence of a dual-chamber pacemaker. While transthoracic echocardiogram (option A) may also be useful in evaluating cardiac function and structure, it may not provide the same level of detail regarding arrhythmic activity as Holter monitoring. Screening for thrombophilia (option B) may also be appropriate, but it is not the most immediate next step given the patient's symptoms and medical history. Serial blood cultures (option D) are not likely to be helpful in this case, as they are more commonly used to diagnose sepsis or infections.

Answer: D: Monitor the patient with follow-up in 6 months.
Explanation: The patient presents with a known choroidal nevus that has been stable over the past 2 years, and there are no new concerning features such as orange pigment or subretinal fluid. The patient is also asymptomatic with no diplopia, pain, or blurred vision. Given the patient's history of non-Hodgkin follicular lymphoma, it is important to monitor the nevus for any changes, but the absence of any new concerning features and the patient's stable visual acuity suggest that monitoring the patient with follow-up in 6 months is the appropriate next step.

Option A, performing fluorescein angiography, may be useful in evaluating the choroidal nevus, but it is not necessary at this point given the stable nature of the lesion and the patient's lack of symptoms.

Option B, obtaining orbital imaging, may also be useful in evaluating the retro-orbital hypoechoic cavity, but it is not the most appropriate next step given the patient's stable visual acuity and lack of symptoms.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as blurry vision, amelanotic choroidal mass with overlying subretinal fluid, and irregular surface contour on B-scan ultrasonography, are consistent with a choroidal tumor. The patient's history of smoking and lack of known malignant conditions suggest that the tumor is likely to be a choroidal melanoma. The patient should be investigated for sarcoidosis and tuberculosis, as these conditions can also present with choroidal lesions. If the investigations are negative, treatment with steroids may be considered to reduce the risk of vision loss. Referring the patient to a primary care physician for a metastatic workup (option C) may not be the most appropriate next step, as the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a localized choroidal tumor rather than a systemic metastatic disease. Treating the mass with radiotherapy (option B) may be considered, but it is not the most appropriate next step as it may not be effective in shrinking the tumor and may cause damage to surrounding tissue. Proceeding with pars plana vitrectomy and biopsy (option D) may also be considered, but it may not be necessary at this stage, and it carries a higher risk of complications compared to observation and steroid treatment. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to investigate for sarcoidosis and tuberculosis, and if negative, start treatment with steroids (option A).

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as a painful subungual mass and destruction of the distal nail plate with onycholysis, are consistent with a diagnosis of subungual squamous cell carcinoma. The lesional biopsy results, which show proliferation of atypical squamous cells invading the dermis, also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's lack of notable medical history, including dyskeratosis congenita, trauma, sun exposure, radiation exposure, chemical exposure to tar or arsenic or exposure to minerals, chronic immunosuppression, or chronic infection, makes it less likely that the lesion is caused by another condition such as onychomycosis, verruca vulgaris, or exostosis.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of recurrent purpura, pain, and edema, along with the presence of bullae, suggest a possible diagnosis of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). TTP is a rare blood disorder characterized by the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body, which can cause a range of symptoms including purpura, pain, and edema. The patient's history of extranodal marginal zone lymphoma and recent chemotherapy treatment increase the likelihood of TTP. Therefore, it is appropriate to test for serum cryoglobulin level, which is a diagnostic marker for TTP. Administering empirical intravenous antibiotics (option A) may not be effective in treating TTP, and protein C concentrate (option B) is not typically used to treat this condition. Calculating a calcium-phosphate product (option C) is not relevant to the patient's symptoms or diagnosis.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as numerous pink-purple papules on the trunk and extremities, weight loss, and mild restrictive lung disease, are consistent with small-vessel vasculitis. The biopsy results show a nodular to diffuse lymphohistiocytic infiltrate and admixed atypical, irregularly contoured lymphocytes with numerous histiocytes, which are also consistent with small-vessel vasculitis. Additionally, the low CD4 signal and robust CD8 signal in the biopsy results suggest an immune-mediated process, which is consistent with small-vessel vasculitis. While granuloma annulare (option B) can also present with papular lesions, it typically does not have the systemic symptoms or immune-mediated features seen in this case. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (option A) can also present with papular lesions, but it typically has a different appearance on biopsy, with a larger number of atypical cells and a more aberrant immunophenotype. Sarcoidosis (option D) can also present with skin lesions and lung involvement, but it typically has a different appearance on biopsy, with a granulomatous pattern and a higher number of multinucleated giant cells.

PPK is a rare genetic disorder that affects the palms and soles and is characterized by numerous small, punctate keratotic papules. The patient's history of partial improvement with previous treatments, but never complete clearance, also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the histopathology findings of a dilated follicular infundibulum with a keratinous core and absent hair shaft are consistent with PPK. While the other options may also present with similar symptoms, they do not match the patient's history and histopathology findings as closely as PPK.

ADEM is an autoimmune demyelinating disease that typically presents with sudden onset of neurological symptoms, often following a viral infection or vaccination. The presence of bilateral optic nerve enhancement on the follow-up MRI also supports this diagnosis.

Repeating the ambulatory ECG after discontinuing the medication can help to assess the effectiveness of this intervention and determine if further interventions are needed.

Therefore, option B is the most appropriate answer.

Option A, implanting a permanent pacemaker, may be necessary if the patient's symptoms persist or worsen despite discontinuing metoprolol tartrate, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this time.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of intermittent stridor and feeding difficulty, along with the physical examination findings of facial dysmorphism, broad and flat nasal dorsum, and mild micrognathia, are consistent with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. The presence of a cystic lesion in the vallecula, as demonstrated by flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy, and the presence of a multispatial mildly enhancing mass in the bilateral retropharyngeal, parapharyngeal, and carotid spaces, as shown on MRI, are also consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's failure to thrive and the presence of a diffuse, soft, palpable mass along the right neck are consistent with a diagnosis of ectopic thymus. Ectopic thymus is a rare congenital anomaly that occurs in approximately 1% of patients with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome. It is characterized by the presence of thymic tissue outside of the mediastinum, often in the neck or thorax. The biopsy results, which revealed a polymorphic population of lymphocytes, fibroadipose tissue, and a concentric island of squamous cells with central keratinization, are also consistent with this diagnosis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is ectopic thymus.

This is a severe, life-threatening adverse reaction to medication, typically associated with a viral infection. The patient's history of documented allergies to β-lactam, macrolide, and cephalosporin antibiotics and previous reactions with rashes, angioedema, and hives suggest that he may be at risk for SJS.

Explanation: The correct answer is A, "Orbital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate for optic nerve invasion and brain MRI to assess for a pineal gland tumor, followed by chemotherapy for the eye."

The clinical case describes a child with a white optic nerve head mass, which is concerning for a possible intraocular tumor. The child has a history of strabismus and leukocoria, which are also concerning signs. The next step in management would be to perform imaging studies to evaluate the extent of the tumor and determine if it has invaded the optic nerve or spread to other parts of the brain. Orbital MRI and brain MRI would be the appropriate imaging modalities to use in this case.

Option B, "Observation for the eye and MRI and magnetic resonance angiography of the head," may be appropriate for certain eye conditions, but it is not the most appropriate choice for this case given the concern for a possible intraocular tumor.

Option C, "Careful examination of the skin and genetic testing of genes on chromosomes 9 and 16," may be relevant for certain genetic conditions that affect the eye, but it is not directly related to the current clinical presentation.

Option D, "Enucleation," is not appropriate at this stage of management, as it is a surgical procedure that is typically reserved for advanced cases of intraocular tumors that have not responded to other treatments. Chemotherapy is a more appropriate first-line treatment for intraocular tumors in children.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of joint deformities and erosive changes on imaging, along with the absence of synovitis and tenosynovitis, are consistent with nivolumab-induced inflammatory arthritis. Nivolumab is a checkpoint inhibitor that can cause immune-related adverse events, including inflammatory arthritis. The patient's history of metastatic human papillomavirus–positive cervical adenocarcinoma and treatment with nivolumab suggest that the arthritis is likely related to the cancer therapy. The absence of autoantibodies and the presence of multifocal osseous erosions also support this diagnosis. Therefore, option C is the most appropriate answer.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of joint pain and stiffness, along with the presence of soft tissue masses around the sternoclavicular joints and scapulae, suggest a possible diagnosis of a connective tissue disorder such as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus erythematosus. The patient's history of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome also supports this possibility. The laboratory findings of proteinuria and normal erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) are consistent with a connective tissue disorder. Therefore, it would be appropriate to order serum protein electrophoresis and serum free light chains assay to help confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible causes of joint pain and proteinuria, such as multiple myeloma or monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). Bone scan may also be useful in evaluating the extent of joint involvement, but it is not as specific for connective tissue disorders as serum protein electrophoresis and free light chain assay. Methotrexate is a medication commonly used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, but it would not be appropriate to start it without further diagnostic testing. Temporal artery biopsy is used to diagnose giant cell arteritis, which is not suggested by the patient's symptoms or laboratory results.

Answer: B
Explanation: A point-of-care (POC) hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test via fingerstick is the most appropriate choice for this patient. The patient's concern about having diabetes and lack of symptoms suggest that a diagnostic test is necessary. A POC HbA1c test is a quick and convenient way to determine the patient's glycemic status, and it can provide reliable results in a primary care setting. Additionally, the patient's obesity and hypertension increase the likelihood of a diagnosis of diabetes or prediabetes, making the test even more appropriate. Performing a laboratory-based glucose test (Option A) may not provide an accurate representation of the patient's long-term glycemic control, and a laboratory-based HbA1c test (Option C) may not be as timely or convenient as a POC test. Not performing glycemic testing (Option D) would not address the patient's concern or provide appropriate care.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's history of itchy eruptions all over his body, along with the appearance of multiple dome-shaped nodules on his back, and the presence of small to medium-sized atypical cells with focal areas of epidermotropism on histopathology, are all consistent with a diagnosis of ichthyosiform mycosis fungoides (IMF). IMF is a rare variant of mycosis fungoides, a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, that is characterized by the presence of scaly, itchy patches and nodules on the skin. The patient's lack of a family history of inherited ichthyosis or atopy, and the absence of atypical cells in the peripheral blood, also support this diagnosis. In contrast, cutaneous pseudolymphoma (option A) typically presents with a more sudden onset of papules or nodules, and is often associated with a history of prior radiation therapy or certain medications. Ichthyosis vulgaris with atopic dermatitis (option C) typically presents with more widespread scaling and redness, and is often associated with a personal or family history of atopy. Large plaque parapsoriasis (option D) typically presents with larger, more widespread plaques on the skin, and is often associated with a longer duration of disease.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with annular atrophic lichen planus (AALP). AALP is a rare variant of lichen planus that is characterized by the development of small, round, or oval-shaped atrophic patches on the skin. The lesions are typically well-defined, with a raised border and a depressed center, and may be slightly erythematous or hypopigmented. The condition often affects the sun-exposed areas of the body, such as the face, neck, and arms, but can also occur on other areas, including the breasts. The etiology of AALP is not fully understood, but it is believed to be related to an immune-mediated response. The patient's history of breast augmentation surgery and subsequent development of atrophic annular plaques on the breasts suggests that the condition may have been triggered by a surgical or implant-related factor. The other options, erythema annulare centrifugum, porokeratosis, and granuloma annulare, can also cause annular lesions, but do not match the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings as closely as AALP. Therefore, option B, Annular atrophic lichen planus, is the most likely diagnosis.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive lower extremity weakness, sensory loss, and sphincter dysfunction, along with the MRI findings of a long-segment, expansile T2 hyperintense lesion spanning C5 through T12 and involving greater than two-thirds of the cord diameter, are consistent with a diagnosis of glioma. The absence of any infectious or inflammatory markers in the patient's workup, as well as the lack of a personal or family history of neurological disease, also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the presence of extensive ill-defined enhancement of the spinal cord spanning T3 through T9, as seen on the MRI, is consistent with a glioma. It is important to note that a biopsy or surgical resection would be needed to confirm the diagnosis.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of exertional dyspnea and neck fullness, along with the physical examination findings of an enlarged, pulsatile liver and abnormal electrocardiography (ECG) tracing, suggest the possibility of a cardiac condition. Specifically, the ECG findings of rightward axis and inferolateral T-wave inversions suggest a right ventricular strain pattern, which could be indicative of pulmonary hypertension or cor pulmonale. Additionally, the patient's history of exertional dyspnea suggests that the pulmonary hypertension may be due to an underlying cardiac condition, such as a left-sided heart failure.

Therefore, the next step in the patient's evaluation would be to perform right and left heart catheterization (option B) to assess the hemodynamics of the heart and determine the cause of the pulmonary hypertension. This procedure would allow for direct measurement of pressures within the heart and lungs, as well as the injection of contrast dye to visualize the coronary arteries and assess for any blockages.

Option A, transesophageal echocardiography, may also be useful in evaluating the patient's cardiac function and identifying any structural abnormalities, but it may not provide the same level of detail as right and left heart catheterization in assessing the hemodynamics of the heart.

Option C, magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement, may be useful in evaluating the liver and detecting any potential liver disease, but it is not directly related to the patient's cardiac symptoms and findings.

Option D, liver biopsy, is not necessary at this time, as the patient's liver function tests are normal and there is no evidence of liver disease on physical examination or imaging studies.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's presentation of a breast mass, along with the family history of brain cancer in his sister, suggests the possibility of a genetic mutation that may be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. In addition, the patient's obesity and smoking history may also contribute to his risk. Therefore, it would be appropriate to order breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to further evaluate the mass and assess the extent of any potential malignancy. This would help guide management decisions and ensure that the patient receives appropriate treatment.

Option A, perform percutaneous biopsy of the mass, may not provide sufficient information to determine the extent of the malignancy, and may not be able to distinguish between benign and malignant lesions. Option B, excise the mass, may be appropriate if the diagnosis is already established, but in this case, a definitive diagnosis has not been made. Option D, send hormonal evaluation for gynecomastia, is not relevant to the patient's presentation and would not provide useful information for managing the breast mass.

Answer: D: Stevens-Johnson syndrome.
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including severe dysphagia, dysphonia, fever, rhinorrhea, and desquamatory lesions on the mucosa of the oral cavity, lips, penis, and eye sclera, are consistent with Stevens-Johnson syndrome. The patient's history of a similar but less severe clinical event 5 years previously, which resolved following treatment with corticosteroids, also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the presence of desquamatory injuries on the vocal folds and ventricular bands, as well as the moderate laryngeal mucosa hypertrophy related to the inflammatory reaction, are also consistent with Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Bullous pemphigus, toxic epidermal necrolysis (Lyell syndrome), and multiforme erythema can also present with similar symptoms, but the patient's history and the presence of desquamatory lesions on the mucosa of the upper aerodigestive tract suggest Stevens-Johnson syndrome as the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive bilateral nasal obstruction and recurrent epistaxis, along with the physical examination findings of a pedunculated mass with a smooth mucosal surface arising from the roof of the nasopharynx, are consistent with a nasopharyngeal mass. The CT imaging results show a well-defined, pedunculated polypoid lesion with areas of calcification in the nasopharynx, which is also consistent with a nasopharyngeal mass. The histopathological results show that the tumor cells are arranged in papillary structures with fibrovascular cores and have nuclear grooves, which are features consistent with papillary adenocarcinoma. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is papillary adenocarcinoma.

The other options are less likely diagnoses for the following reasons:

* Squamous cell carcinoma: This type of cancer is more commonly found in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses, rather than the nasopharynx. It is also less likely to have a pedunculated growth pattern or calcifications.
* Lymphoma: This type of cancer can occur in the nasopharynx, but it is less likely to have a pedunculated growth pattern or calcifications.
* Chondrosarcoma: This type of cancer is rare in the nasopharynx and would be unlikely to have the histopathological features described.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is papillary adenocarcinoma.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including painful and pruritic ulcerative cutaneous lesions involving the back, nose, lips, and mucosal lesions involving the oral cavity and oropharynx, are consistent with pemphigus vulgaris. The positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold test result and negative serum antigen testing for other diseases support this diagnosis. Additionally, the elevated levels of antidesmoglein 1 immunoglobulin G (IgG) and antidesmoglein 3 IgG found through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay serological testing are also consistent with pemphigus vulgaris. The patient's history of living on a ranch in Mexico and the appearance of the lesions 5 months prior suggest that the patient may have been exposed to the bacteria that cause pemphigus vulgaris. The bullous lesions involving the epiglottis, left posterior true vocal fold, left false vocal fold, and right vestibule, as well as the positive direct immunofluorescence staining for immunoglobulin G of an intralesional biopsy, further support this diagnosis. Therefore, option C, pemphigus vulgaris, is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The correct answer is C, Eosinophilic sialodochitis.

The patient's symptoms of recurring left submandibular gland swelling and pain, along with the presence of a cast at the opening of the Wharton duct, are consistent with eosinophilic sialodochitis. The histological slide of the cast showing numerous eosinophils supports this diagnosis. Eosinophilic sialodochitis is a rare condition characterized by the inflammation of the salivary ducts, typically caused by an allergic reaction or an immune-mediated disorder. The patient's history of allergic rhinitis increases the likelihood of an allergic etiology.

IgG4-related sialadenitis (A) is a rare autoimmune disorder that can cause inflammation of the salivary glands, but it typically presents with symptoms of dry mouth, swelling of the salivary glands, and painless bilateral enlargement of the parotid glands. Kimura disease (B) is a rare condition characterized by the inflammation of the salivary glands, but it typically presents with symptoms of painless bilateral enlargement of the parotid glands and submandibular glands, and the patient's history of recurring swelling and pain does not fit with this diagnosis. Angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia (D) is a rare condition that can cause salivary gland inflammation, but it typically presents with symptoms of painless enlargement of the salivary glands and does not explain the patient's symptoms of recurring swelling and pain.

Answer: D
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and signs, such as pain, photophobia, conjunctival inflammation, and corneal infiltrate, suggest an infectious keratitis. The presence of a hypopyon and the peculiar graft-host interface haze with a crisscross pattern also support this diagnosis. In vivo confocal microscopy showed diffuse hyperreflective changes at the graft-host interface, which is consistent with an infectious process. Given the severity of the symptoms and the risk of vision loss, the patient should be brought to the operating room urgently and the DSAEK graft should be removed and sent for microbiological culture and sensitivity testing. This is the most appropriate next step in management. Starting a broad-spectrum oral antibiotic such as moxifloxacin (option A) may be appropriate, but it is not the most urgent step in management. Starting topical and systemic antifungal treatment (option B) may not be effective against bacterial infections. Restarting topical steroid drops (option C) may not be appropriate given the risk of infection.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's history of a gradual decline in vision bilaterally over the past 2 years, along with the physical examination findings of multifocal choroidal lesions, raises the suspicion of a chronic inflammatory condition. The patient's history of a chronic cough and lack of any known ocular or medical history suggest that the condition may be related to an infectious or inflammatory process. An interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) (option C) would be the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic workup, as it can help to identify whether the patient has an active infection or inflammation.

Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotyping (option A) may also be considered in the diagnostic workup, but it would not be the most appropriate next step. HLA haplotyping can help to identify genetic susceptibility to certain diseases, but it would not provide information about the current inflammatory status of the patient.

Empirical steroids (option B) may be considered in the treatment of certain inflammatory conditions, but it would not be the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's condition has not been definitively diagnosed, and steroids may not be effective in treating the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

Observation (option D) may be considered in certain cases where the patient's condition is stable and there is no evidence of active inflammation or infection. However, in this case, the patient's gradual decline in vision over the past 2 years and the presence of multifocal choroidal lesions suggest that the condition is likely active and may require further evaluation and treatment.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of acute onset of blurry vision, elevated intraocular pressure, and mild diffuse vasodilation are consistent with angle-closure glaucoma. The presence of shallow anterior chambers and clear lenses suggests that the angle closure is likely due to pupillary blockage. The patient's history of hypertension and asthma may also contribute to the development of angle closure.

On ultrasound biomicroscopy, the presence of edema of the ciliary body and anterior uveal effusion (arrowhead) supports the diagnosis of angle-closure glaucoma. Therefore, the next step would be to order magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to investigate for masses that may be causing the angle closure.

Performing peripheral iridotomy (Option A) may be considered later in the management of the condition, but it is not the most appropriate next step. Clear lens extraction (Option C) is not indicated at this point, as the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest angle-closure glaucoma rather than cataract. Providing patient education and observation (Option D) is important, but it is not the most urgent step in managing the patient's condition.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of a bulging eye, tearing, and limited abduction and supraduction suggest that there may be a problem with the orbit or the lacrimal system. The abnormality in the posterior pole of the left eye seen on fundus examination and fluorescein angiography also supports this. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits would be the most appropriate next step to evaluate the orbit and surrounding tissues, and to identify any potential causes of the patient's symptoms.

Applanation tonometry (A) would not be useful in this case as it is used to measure intraocular pressure, which is not relevant to the patient's symptoms.
Serum thyroid testing (B) may be appropriate if the patient had symptoms suggestive of thyroid disease, but there is no indication of this in the case.
Computed angiography of the head (D) may be useful in evaluating the blood vessels of the head and neck, but it would not provide information about the orbit or the lacrimal system, which are the likely sources of the patient's symptoms.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of diplopia, myalgia, and proximal muscle weakness, along with the elevated creatine kinase and aldolase levels, suggest a myositis syndrome. The presence of abnormal single-fiber electromyography results and absence of blocking further support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of hepatocellular carcinoma and treatment with checkpoint inhibitors increases the likelihood of a paraneoplastic syndrome. Miller Fisher syndrome is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome associated with various cancers, including liver cancer, and is characterized by a combination of myasthenia gravis-like symptoms, myositis, and autonomic dysfunction. Therefore, option C is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of rapid vision loss and placoid yellow choroidal lesions with subretinal fluid are concerning for neuro-ophthalmic manifestations of metastatic breast cancer. Intravitreal anti-VEGF injections can help to treat macular edema and improve vision. Obtaining an MRI of the head and orbits (option C) may also be helpful in evaluating the extent of intracranial disease, but it is not the most urgent step in management. Initiating high-dose intravenous corticosteroid medication (option A) may be considered later in the management of the patient's condition, but it is not the most appropriate initial step. Stopping capecitabine and trastuzumab (option D) may be necessary if the patient's vision loss is found to be related to the medications, but this decision should be made in consultation with the patient's oncologist. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to inject intravitreal anti-VEGF into both eyes (option B).

Answer: C. Vulvar Crohn disease.
Explanation: The patient's history of rectal carcinoma with lymph node metastasis and recent chemotherapy suggests that she may have an increased risk of developing a secondary malignancy. The indurated plaques and nodules on the vulva, as well as the biopsy results (Figure 1B and C), are consistent with a diagnosis of Vulvar Crohn disease. This is a rare condition that can occur in patients with a history of inflammatory bowel disease, such as Crohn's disease. The patient's age and history of rectal carcinoma also increase the likelihood of this diagnosis.

The other options are less likely due to the following reasons:

A. Primary mucinous adenocarcinoma: This diagnosis is less likely given the patient's history of rectal carcinoma and the presence of nodules on the surface of the plaques.

B. Invasive extramammary Paget disease: This diagnosis is less likely due to the absence of typical Pagetoid spread and the presence of well-defined plaques.

D. Cutaneous metastatic mucinous carcinoma from rectal carcinoma: This diagnosis is less likely given the absence of any known metastatic lesions in the skin and the presence of nodules on the surface of the plaques.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as the firm plaque on the occipital scalp, the development of multiple brown-red, dome-shaped papules on the nose and cheeks, and the rubbery plaques on the sacrococcygeal area, along with hypopigmented patches on the right buttock, are consistent with a diagnosis of Shagreen patch. Shagreen patch is a rare genetic disorder characterized by fibrosis and angiofibroma. The biopsy results also support this diagnosis, as they show features of angiofibroma.

Option A, Sclerotic neurofibroma, is not a correct diagnosis as it is a benign tumor that arises from the peripheral nerve sheath and does not present with the same symptoms as Shagreen patch.

Option B, Familial cutaneous collagenoma, is also not a correct diagnosis as it is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by skin fragility and poor wound healing, and does not present with the same symptoms as Shagreen patch.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and the histopathological findings are consistent with dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP), an uncommon soft tissue sarcoma. The buttonhole sign, which is characterized by a small depression or pit in the center of the lesion, is a common feature of DFSP. The histopathological findings of poorly circumscribed hypercellular proliferation of spindle cells occupying the lower reticular dermis with lacelike infiltration of the subcutaneous fat, and the somewhat whorled, uniform appearing spindle cells with mildly hyperchromatic, elongated, wavy nuclei surrounded by pale cytoplasm, are also consistent with DFSP. Additionally, the patient's history of ADA-SCID and the use of immunosuppressive therapy may increase the risk of developing DFSP.

Therefore, option C, Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, atrophic variant, is the most likely diagnosis.

Option A, Neurofibroma, is a benign tumor of the nervous system, and does not match the patient's symptoms or histopathological findings.

Option B, Anetoderma, is a rare condition characterized by the development of multiple, small, soft, pedunculated papules on the skin, and is not related to the patient's symptoms or histopathological findings.

Answer: C
Explanation: The correct diagnosis is Ecchordosis physalsiphora. This is a rare benign tumor that arises from the remnants of the notochord, which is a structure that runs along the length of the neural tube during embryonic development. The tumor typically occurs in the sphenoid sinus and has a characteristic appearance on imaging, with a multilobulated mass that extends into the sphenoid sinus and shows heterogeneous enhancement on postcontrast imaging. The pathological features of the tumor, as described in the case, are also consistent with Ecchordosis physalsiphora, including sheets of neoplastic, vacuolated, "soap bubble-like" cells with a myxoid background.

The other options are not correct for the following reasons:

A: Lipoma is a benign tumor of adipose tissue that does not occur in the sphenoid sinus.

B: Chordoma is a malignant tumor that arises from the notochord and has a different imaging and pathological appearance than Ecchordosis physalsiphora.

D: Chondrosarcoma is a malignant tumor that arises from cartilage and does not have the characteristic multilobulated appearance or myxoid background of Ecchordosis physalsiphora.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of epiphora, headache, and facial pressure, along with the physical examination findings of a palpable subcutaneous nodule and residual tumor visible on nasal endoscopy, suggest a nasal cavity tumor. The patient's age and the location of the tumor also increase the likelihood of a sinonasal tumor. The histopathological findings of sheets of monomorphic undifferentiated tumor cells with interspersed areas of abrupt squamous differentiation and keratinization are consistent with a poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma, which is the most common type of sinonasal carcinoma. The immunohistochemical staining results, with positivity for cytokeratin 5/6 and p63, and negativity for Epstein-Barr virus, p16, CD45, and synaptophysin, also support this diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of hearing loss, vestibular aqueduct enlargement, and fistulous communication between the internal auditory canal and the cochlea are consistent with Usher syndrome, a genetic disorder that affects both hearing and vision. The patient's family history of childhood hearing loss in the maternal grandfather also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the genetic mutation of the POU3F4 gene, which is associated with Usher syndrome, was identified in the patient. Therefore, option C is the most likely diagnosis.

Option A, Branchio-oto-renal syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of the branchial arches, inner ear, and kidneys. While it can cause hearing loss, it is not typically associated with vestibular aqueduct enlargement or fistulous communication between the IAC and cochlea.

Doppler ultrasonography with and without Valsalva can help evaluate the vascularity of the masses and potentially distinguish between various orbital tumors, such as hemangioma, lymphangioma, or orbital varix. Additionally, it can help assess the risk of complications such as bleeding or thrombosis. Therefore, obtaining Doppler ultrasonography results with and without Valsalva (option B) would be the next appropriate step in the diagnostic workup.

Thyroid function test results or endocrine evaluation results (option A) may also be useful in evaluating the patient's symptoms, but they are not as directly relevant to the patient's orbital masses as Doppler ultrasonography. Chest computed tomography (option C) may be necessary if a thoracic lesion is suspected, but it is not the most appropriate next step based on the patient's current symptoms and MRI findings. Obtaining biopsy results (option D) may be necessary later in the diagnostic workup, but it is not the next step given the patient's current presentation.

Answer: A
Explanation: Given the patient's history of Escherichia coli infection complicated by hemolytic uremic syndrome and the presence of a large, elevated, homogenous, gray mass in the macula of the right eye with temporal pallor of the optic disc, the most likely diagnosis is uveitis associated with the infection. The patient's symptoms of diminished color vision and lack of stereoacuity, as well as the abnormalities seen on optical coherence tomography, are also consistent with this diagnosis. Plaque brachytherapy or enucleation of the right eye may be necessary to treat the uveitis and prevent further vision loss. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.

Option B, ordering magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and a medical genetics evaluation, may be appropriate if the patient had a family history of inherited retinal diseases or other systemic findings suggestive of a genetic disorder, but it is not the most appropriate next step given the patient's history and clinical findings.

Option C, starting oral corticosteroids, may be considered as a treatment option for uveitis, but it is not the most appropriate next step without first considering the possibility of plaque brachytherapy or enucleation.

Option D, performing a vitreous tap and injecting with antivirals, may be appropriate if the patient had a diagnosis of viral retinitis, but it is not the most appropriate next step given the patient's history and clinical findings.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and findings, including intermittent temporal visual field loss, floaters, and retinal detachment with macular involvement, suggest a possible diagnosis of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease. VKH disease is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the uveal tract and can cause choroidal detachments, retinal detachment, and vision loss. The presence of choroidal detachments in both eyes and the absence of retinal tears suggest a diagnosis of VKH disease rather than retinal detachment caused by trauma or other conditions.

Immunosuppressive therapy, option D, may be considered as a treatment option for VKH disease, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management. The patient's visual acuity has worsened despite oral prednisone therapy, and the presence of subretinal fluid suggests that the disease is still active. Surgical intervention may be necessary to relieve the subretinal fluid and prevent further vision loss.

Surgery to create scleral windows, option B, may be considered in cases of refractory uveitis or glaucoma, but it is not directly related to the patient's current symptoms and findings. Surgery to create a scleral buckle, option C, may be a viable surgical option to relieve the subretinal fluid and prevent further vision loss. However, the decision to proceed with surgery should be based on a thorough evaluation of the patient's individual circumstances and the potential risks and benefits of the procedure.

Diagnostic vitrectomy with cytologic testing, option A, may be considered to confirm the diagnosis of VKH disease and to rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms. However, given the patient's symptoms and findings, the diagnosis of VKH disease is already suspected, and diagnostic vitrectomy may not be necessary at this stage.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's presentation of substantial loss of visual acuity in the left eye, along with retinal thickening, capillary nonperfusion, and disc neovascularization, suggests diabetic retinopathy (DR) with macular edema. The patient's history of type 1 diabetes for 5 years and lack of compliance with treatment regimen further support this diagnosis.

The appropriate management for this patient would be a combination of intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections and laser panretinal photocoagulation. Intravitreal VEGF injections would help to reduce the macular edema and prevent further vision loss, while laser panretinal photocoagulation would target the peripheral retinal nonperfusion and reduce the risk of further progression of DR.

Option A, laser panretinal photocoagulation alone, may not effectively address the macular edema and could potentially worsen the patient's vision. Option B, intravitreal anti-VEGF injections alone, may not adequately address the peripheral retinal nonperfusion and DR progression. Option D, pars plana vitrectomy with endolaser, is a more invasive procedure that may be considered in advanced cases of DR with severe vitreomacular traction or retinal detachment, but is not the most appropriate choice for this patient's current presentation.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of bilateral blurry vision occurring after a head injury are consistent with a possible diagnosis of bilateral macular edema. The macular OCT scan supports this diagnosis, showing bilateral macular edema with cystoid abnormalities. Systemic or bilateral intraocular corticosteroid therapy (option B) would be the appropriate next step in management, as it can help reduce inflammation and swelling in the retina. Observation (option A) may not be sufficient to address the underlying cause of the macular edema, while epiretinal membrane peeling (option C) may not be necessary given the absence of retinal commotio or hemorrhages. Bilateral antivascular endothelial growth factor therapy (option D) may also not be necessary at this time, as there is no evidence of neovascularization or severe retinal ischemia.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's history of a rapidly expanding, itchy, painful nodule, which measured 3 cm in diameter, 5 months prior to presentation, and the appearance of satellite telangiectatic papules, are consistent with the diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma. The patient's age and the location of the lesion on the scapular region also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the histopathological findings of the skin punch biopsy (Figure, C) show features consistent with Merkel cell carcinoma, such as a dense infiltrate of small, round, blue cells with finely granular chromatin and prominent nucleoli, and a superficial perivascular arrangement. The patient's weight loss, decreased appetite, and painful lesion also support the diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma, as these symptoms are commonly seen in patients with this condition.

The other options are less likely diagnoses for this patient's condition. Cutaneous metastasis from small cell lung cancer (option A) is less likely given the patient's age and the location of the lesion. Loxoscelism (option B) is unlikely as there is no history of a spider bite or any other signs of loxoscelism. Primary cutaneous lymphoma (Sézary syndrome) (option D) is also less likely given the patient's age and the absence of other signs of lymphoma.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's history of tobacco use and symptoms of progressive cough and dyspnea, along with the physical examination findings of wheezes and rhonchi, suggest chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) as a possible diagnosis. The patient's age and smoking history also increase the likelihood of alpha-1-antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency, which can contribute to the development of COPD. Therefore, assessing serum AAT level and genotype would be an appropriate next step in the diagnostic workup. Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsy (Option A) may be necessary later in the evaluation, but it is not the most appropriate next step. Inhaled nasal nitric oxide and ciliary dyskinesia genetic testing (Option C) are not likely to be helpful in this case, as the patient does not have a history of nasal congestion or other symptoms suggestive of ciliary dyskinesia. Sweat chloride and cystic fibrosis genetic screening (Option D) are also not likely to be helpful, as the patient does not have a history of neonatal respiratory distress or other symptoms suggestive of cystic fibrosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The clinical presentation of diffuse poikilodermatous patches and plaques, with hypopigmented and hyperpigmented reticulations, is consistent with cutaneous amyloidosis. The absence of lymphadenopathy and the presence of atrophic plaques also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the immunohistochemical analysis (Figure, C and D) shows positivity for amyloid deposits in the dermis, which is consistent with cutaneous amyloidosis. Mycosis fungoides (option A) typically presents with patches and plaques that are more scaly and have a more irregular border, and there is often associated lymphadenopathy. Large-plaque parapsoriasis (option B) typically has larger, more discrete plaques with a longer duration, and there is often associated itching. Dowling-Degos disease (option D) typically has more widespread, symmetrical, and confluent lesions with a characteristic "fish-scale" appearance, and there is often associated palmoplantar keratoderma.

Answer: C
Explanation:
The given case presents an irregularly linear, rusty-brown, atrophic, streaklike plaque extending from the tip of the right shoulder to the right biceps, where it ends in arborizing purple plaque with scattered, slightly indurated, irregular papules within it. The patient complains of a mild tingling sensation within the lesion. The patient's medical history includes right total reverse shoulder replacement 5 years prior. A punch biopsy of the slightly indurated papule from the involved area on the right biceps was completed.

The diagnosis is Intraoperative cutaneous electrical injury (Lichtenberg figure) (C). This is supported by the patient's history of right total reverse shoulder replacement, the presence of an irregularly linear, rusty-brown, atrophic, streaklike plaque, and the arborizing purple plaque with scattered, slightly indurated, irregular papules within it. The patient's complaint of a mild tingling sensation within the lesion also supports this diagnosis.

Linear morphea (A) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by inflammation and sclerosis of the skin, often with a linear or band-like pattern. While the patient's lesion does have a linear pattern, the presence of an arborizing purple plaque and the patient's history of shoulder replacement surgery make this diagnosis less likely.

Serpentine supravenous hyperpigmentation (B) is a condition characterized by linear or serpentine hyperpigmentation of the skin, often in a supravenous distribution. While the patient's lesion does have a linear pattern, the presence of an arborizing purple plaque and the patient's history of shoulder replacement surgery make this diagnosis less likely.

Intralymphatic histiocytosis (D) is a rare condition characterized by the accumulation of histiocytes in the lymphatic vessels.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of painless, nonpruritic, diffuse dark gray skin, nail beds, and eye discoloration are consistent with diffuse melanosis cutis. This condition is characterized by the accumulation of melanin in the skin, resulting in a darkening of the skin, nails, and eyes. The patient's history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and recent initiation of pembrolizumab therapy increase the likelihood of this diagnosis, as diffuse melanosis cutis has been reported as a rare side effect of immune checkpoint inhibitors such as pembrolizumab. The other options, hemochromatosis, Addison disease, and hyperpigmentation due to sun exposure, do not fit the patient's symptoms or medical history.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient has received multiple shocks from the S-ICD device, indicating that it has recognized a potentially life-threatening arrhythmia and delivered therapy. However, the patient has not experienced any symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, or syncope, and physical examination does not reveal any signs of decompensated heart failure. This suggests that the device has been effective in preventing a potentially life-threatening arrhythmia. Administering anticoagulation and increasing the dose of the β-blocker would help to further reduce the risk of arrhythmia and prevent future shocks.

Option B, subcutaneous ICD reprogramming and observation, may be considered, but it is not the most appropriate option at this time. The device has been recently implanted, and it has been effective in delivering therapy. There is no indication that the device is not functioning properly, and reprogramming may not address the underlying cause of the arrhythmia.

Option C, administering a loading dose of amiodarone, may also be considered, but it is not the most appropriate option at this time. Amiodarone is an anti-arrhythmic drug that can be used to treat ventricular arrhythmias, but it may not be effective in preventing future shocks in this case, as the patient has already received multiple shocks from the device. Additionally, amiodarone has potential side effects, and its use should be carefully considered in patients with heart failure.

Option D, referring the patient for catheter ablation, may be considered in the future if the patient continues to experience arrhythmias despite optimal medical therapy and device therapy. However, it is not the most appropriate option at this time, as the patient has only recently received the S-ICD device and it has been effective in preventing a potentially life-threatening arrhythmia.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of a 1-year history of a right tongue mass that waxed and waned but never completely healed, along with the presence of constant, severe stabbing pain, right otalgia, and occasional swelling that caused oral dysphagia, are consistent with a diagnosis of Schwannoma. The physical examination findings of a 3x2 cm, exophytic and raised, plateaulike lesion on the right dorsolateral tongue with approximately 1 to 2 cm of surrounding induration also support this diagnosis. The biopsy findings of ulceration, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, and abundant acute and chronic inflammation replete with eosinophils, along with positive immunohistochemistry staining for SOX-10 in the proliferating spindle-shaped cells, further support the diagnosis of Schwannoma. The presence of a traumatic ulcerative granuloma with stromal eosinophilia and the possibility of an unsampled submucosal mass with overlying ulceration, as suggested by the pathologist who interpreted the biopsy findings, also support the diagnosis of Schwannoma. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Schwannoma with a traumatic ulcerative granuloma with stromal eosinophilialike reaction.

The biopsy results shown in Figure B and C, which reveal granulomas with central caseation, are also consistent with histoplasmosis. Tuberculosis of the palate (option A) is unlikely given the patient's history of HIV infection and the absence of other signs of TB infection.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's sudden-onset painless blurry vision, reduced visual acuity, and hyperdistention of the capsular bag with turbid fluid on OCT suggest a possible posterior capsular bag rupture or vitreous hemorrhage. Performing a posterior capsulotomy as part of pars plana vitrectomy would be the appropriate next step to relieve the vitreous traction and allow for better visualization of the retina. This procedure would also help to remove any blood or debris that may be obstructing the visual axis.

Option B, performing posterior capsulotomy with Nd:YAG laser, may be considered, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a more urgent need for vitrectomy, and the Nd:YAG laser may not be able to effectively treat the underlying cause of the blurry vision.

Option C, exchanging the IOL, may be necessary in the future, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this time. The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a more urgent need for vitrectomy, and exchanging the IOL would not address the underlying cause of the blurry vision.

Option D, observing the patient, is not appropriate given the patient's sudden-onset painless blurry vision and hyperdistention of the capsular bag with turbid fluid on OCT. These findings suggest a more urgent need for intervention to relieve the vitreous traction and allow for better visualization of the retina.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's presentation of bilateral, gray-white, irregular, poorly circumscribed, linear and nummular central and peripheral corneal opacities, confined primarily to the subepithelium and focally to the underlying anterior stroma, is consistent with corneal opacification due to Sjögren syndrome. Topical cyclosporine has been shown to improve corneal opacification in patients with Sjögren syndrome, likely by reducing inflammation and promoting epithelial healing. Therefore, option C, initiating topical cyclosporine, would be the most appropriate next step in management. Oral acyclovir sodium (option A) would not be effective in treating corneal opacification due to Sjögren syndrome, as it is primarily used for treating herpetic keratitis. Penetrating keratoplasty (option B) would be an invasive and risky procedure for a condition that can be managed with less invasive measures. Superficial corneal biopsy (option D) may be considered in cases where the diagnosis is uncertain, but in this case, the clinical presentation and history are consistent with Sjögren syndrome-related corneal opacification, making biopsy unnecessary.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as floaters and flashes, suggest that the subluxed crystalline lens may be causing problems. Additionally, the B-scan ultrasonography results showed that the temporal mass and the inferiorly subluxed lens were separate from the wall of the eye, which suggests that the lens is not attached to the eye and is likely causing irritation. Therefore, the next step would be to remove the subluxed lens through pars plana lensectomy. This will help to alleviate the patient's symptoms and prevent any further complications.

The other options are not appropriate for the following reasons:

* Plaque radiotherapy (option A) is not necessary as the patient does not have a tumor that needs to be treated.
* Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits (option C) may be necessary in the future to monitor the patient's condition, but it is not the next step in managing the patient's current symptoms.
* Biopsy of the choroidal mass (option D) is not necessary at this time, as the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest that the subluxed lens is the likely cause of the problem, and removing the lens will help to alleviate the patient's symptoms.

Explanation: The patient's history of immunosuppression following a renal transplant, combined with the presence of multifocal vasogenic edema and ring-enhancing lesions on imaging, suggests a diagnosis of primary central nervous system posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). The patient's age and the absence of a history of viral infection also support this diagnosis. The presence of CD20-positive cells on immunohistochemical stain of the biopsy specimen further supports the diagnosis of PTLD. Toxoplasmosis (option A) is unlikely given the absence of a history of exposure to Toxoplasma gondii and the lack of characteristic imaging findings. Glioblastoma (option C) is unlikely given the patient's age and the multifocal nature of the lesions. Metastatic disease from an unknown primary neoplasm (option D) is a possibility, but the patient's history of immunosuppression and the presence of PTLD in the biopsy specimen make it less likely.

It is likely that the patient has a lesion affecting the sympathetic nervous system, which could be caused by a brainstem stroke or aneurysmal compression of the left third cranial nerve. However, before considering these more serious causes, it is important to perform a detailed review of systemic and topical medications to rule out any medication-related causes of Horner syndrome. Therefore, option C should be performed first. Option A and B are not necessary at this point, as the patient's symptoms do not suggest a brainstem stroke or aneurysmal compression.

Therefore, it would be appropriate to stop further nontubercular diagnostic testing and continue antitubercular therapy. Additional pericardial effusion cytology and culture testing may not provide significant additional information and may delay appropriate treatment. Initiating oral colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and steroids for systemic inflammation may also not be effective in treating tuberculosis and may have adverse effects.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest the presence of a possible kidney stone or obstruction in the urinary tract. The contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis reveals a well-circumscribed mass with a small focus of central high density, which could be indicative of a kidney stone or a tumor. Given the patient's history of nephrolithiasis and the presence of abdominal pain, it is likely that the mass is related to a kidney stone. Therefore, the next step would be to perform an exploratory laparotomy and excision of the mass to confirm the diagnosis and relieve the obstruction. This would be the most appropriate choice, as it would allow for a definitive diagnosis and treatment of the patient's condition.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's history of relapsed refractory acute myeloid leukemia and remote history of breast cancer, along with the presence of pink papules with a white firm center and dark brown core, and the negative blood cultures, suggest that the patient has disseminated cryptococcosis. Cryptococcus is a fungus that can cause opportunistic infections in immunocompromised patients, such as those with leukemia. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results, including leukopenia with neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia, are also consistent with disseminated cryptococcosis. The histopathological analysis of the punch biopsy specimens (Figure, C and D) showed features consistent with cryptococcal infection, including the presence of cryptococcal yeast forms and inflammation. Therefore, option C, disseminated cryptococcosis, is the most likely diagnosis. Option A, disseminated candidiasis with transepidermal elimination, is unlikely given the patient's history and the appearance of the papules. Option B, reactive perforating collagenosis, is a rare condition that is not associated with fungal infections, and option D, Malassezia (formerly Pityrosporum) folliculitis, is a condition that typically causes folliculitis and not papules.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as widespread thickened, verrucous, and hyperpigmented plaques, as well as the elevated levels of carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 19-9, carbohydrate antigen 125, tissue polypeptide antigen, and carbohydrate antigen 242, are consistent with malignant acanthosis nigricans. Additionally, the involvement of the conjunctiva, lips, and gingiva, as well as the recent weight loss, anorexia, and abdominal discomfort, suggest a systemic disease. Malignant acanthosis nigricans is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome associated with various types of cancer, including breast, lung, and gastrointestinal cancer. The patient's history of recent weight loss and abdominal discomfort suggests that an underlying malignancy may be present.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as the gradual onset of a generalized rash over the lower extremities and trunk, the absence of itching, weeping, or bleeding from the rash, and the presence of pedal edema, are consistent with purpura fulminans. The patient's history of smoking and the presence of a spiculated mass in the lung on chest radiograph suggest an underlying malignancy, which is a common association with purpura fulminans. The patient's age and the absence of other symptoms such as joint pains, periorbital edema, and recent intake of medications or herbal medications also support this diagnosis. The lesional skin biopsy sample (Figure, C) shows a vasculopathic process consistent with purpura fulminans. Therefore, option C is the most likely diagnosis.

Option A, acrokeratosis paraneoplastica, is a rare paraneoplastic syndrome associated with certain malignancies, including lung cancer. However, the patient's rash and edema do not fit the typical presentation of acrokeratosis paraneoplastica, which is characterized by a scaly, keratotic rash on the palms and soles.

Option B, cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis, is a condition characterized by inflammation of the small blood vessels in the skin, leading to a purpuric rash. However, the patient's rash does not have the typical features of cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis, such as palpable purpura, and the patient does not have a history of systemic symptoms such as fever, joint pain, or weight loss.

Option D, Henoch-Schönlein purpura, is a systemic vasculitis that affects the skin and other organs. However, the patient's rash and edema do not fit the typical presentation of Henoch-Schönlein purpura, which is characterized by palpable purpura on the buttocks, legs, and arms, and abdominal pain.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient presents with a STEMI, as evidenced by the marked ST-segment elevations in leads V2 to V5 on the 12-lead electrocardiogram. The appropriate next step would be to treat the patient medically with aspirin, β-blocker, clopidogrel, and a statin, as well as to revascularize with percutaneous coronary intervention. This is because the patient has a high risk of cardiac mortality and morbidity, and revascularization has been shown to improve outcomes in patients with STEMI. Therefore, options C and D are both correct, while options A and B are not appropriate for this patient's presentation.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's history of stage IV endometrial serous adenocarcinoma (ESA) and recent recurrence, along with the presence of a firm, erythematous gingival mass with buccal and lingual expansion, and a periapical radiograph showing a diffuse, poorly demarcated radiolucency, are all consistent with an oral metastasis. The infiltrative tumor cells positive for CK7, PAX8, and WT-1, and negative for CK20 and TTF-1, further support this diagnosis. Pyogenic granuloma (option A) is a benign growth that typically occurs in response to local irritation or trauma, and is not associated with a history of cancer. Gingival/periodontal abscess (option B) is an infection of the periodontal tissues, which may cause swelling and pain, but would not explain the patient's history of cancer or the radiographic findings. Squamous cell carcinoma (option D) is a type of oral cancer that may present with a gingival mass, but is not associated with a history of endometrial cancer or the patient's other symptoms.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with Type 2 herpes simplex virus (HSV-2) pharyngitis. The presence of ulcerative lesions with exudate and erythema extending diffusely along the base of tongue, oropharynx, nasopharynx, hypopharynx, and epiglottis, as shown on flexible fiber-optic nasopharyngoscopy, is characteristic of HSV-2 pharyngitis. Additionally, the patient's history of pharyngeal gonorrhea increases the likelihood of a co-infection with HSV-2. While diphtheria, mononucleosis, and pharyngeal gonorrhea can also cause sore throat and odynophagia, the patient's negative rapid Streptococcus test, recent HIV screen, and rapid plasma reagin test, as well as the absence of cervical lymphadenopathy and genital lesions, make HSV-2 pharyngitis the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive cough, dyspnea, hoarseness, and fever, along with the physical examination findings of limited glottic mobility and substantial airway obstruction, are consistent with a diagnosis of nocardiosis. Nocardiosis is a bacterial infection caused by Nocardia asteroides that typically affects the respiratory system and can cause pseudomembranous plaques to form in the airways. The patient's history of chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and smoking may have contributed to the development of the infection. The biopsy results shown in Figure, C, demonstrate branching organisms superficial to squamous epithelium, which is consistent with Nocardia infection. Therefore, option C, Nocardiosis, is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C 
Explanation: The given case describes an incidental discovery of a polypoid mass in the nasal cavity during a preoperative examination for transsphenoidal surgery. The patient did not have any significant rhinological symptoms. The MRI scan showed avid post-contrast enhancement, and the nasal endoscopy revealed tan-colored polypoid lesions emanating from the olfactory clefts of both nasal cavities. The biopsy findings revealed submucosal proliferation of seromucinous and respiratory epithelial glands. Considering these findings, the most likely diagnosis is inverted papilloma, which is a benign tumor that arises from the nasal cavity's respiratory epithelium. It typically presents with unilateral nasal obstruction, bleeding, or discharge, but can also be asymptomatic, as in this case. Inverted papilloma can have a polypoid or nodular appearance and may demonstrate post-contrast enhancement on MRI. The other options, low-grade sinonasal adenocarcinoma, inflammatory nasal polyps, and nasal cavity hamartoma, can also present with nasal polyps or masses, but they are less likely given the patient's history, symptoms, and biopsy results.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of intermittent diplopia and gaze-provoked exotropia suggest a possible neurological cause, such as a cranial nerve palsy or a supranuclear disorder. The patient's history of pituitary macroadenoma and radiation therapy increases the likelihood of a neurological cause. Therefore, the next step would be to order cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate for any intracranial abnormalities that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. This would be the most appropriate next step before considering any surgical or medical interventions.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a conjunctival lesion that has been present since birth. The lesion is painless, reddish, and fluctuant, which suggests that it may be a benign tumor such as a conjunctival nevus. However, the possibility of a malignant tumor such as a melanoma cannot be ruled out based on the clinical findings alone. Therefore, the next step would be to obtain imaging studies to further evaluate the lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits would be the appropriate imaging modality to use in this case, as it can provide detailed information about the size, location, and extent of the lesion, as well as any potential involvement of surrounding tissues. This information would be helpful in determining the appropriate course of action for managing the lesion.

Answer: C
Explanation: The correct answer is C, Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy injections. The patient's symptoms and findings, including the subretinal mass and fluid, worsening visual acuity, and extension of the tumor mass closer to the fovea, are consistent with a choroidal neovascularization (CNV) associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Anti-VEGF therapy is the primary treatment for CNV associated with AMD, as it inhibits the growth of new blood vessels and reduces the amount of fluid in the retina. Photodynamic therapy (A) is not effective for CNV, and iodine 125 plaque brachytherapy (B) is typically used for larger, more advanced tumors. External beam radiotherapy (D) may be considered for cases that are unresponsive to other treatments, but it is not the first-line treatment for CNV associated with AMD.

Answer: D: Repeated visual fields with IOP check in 1 month.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest that he has glaucoma with optic disc cupping and visual field loss. The patient's history of pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency and family history of glaucoma in his grandmother suggest that he may have a genetic predisposition to glaucoma. The patient's current treatment with latanoprost and thiamine, vitamin C, and oxaloacetate for his pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency may not be sufficient to control his glaucoma. Repeating the visual fields with IOP check in 1 month would help to monitor the progression of the disease and determine if the current treatment is effective in controlling the glaucoma. If the visual fields show progression, further treatment may be necessary, such as increasing the medication or considering surgery.

The other options are not the best next steps for the following reasons:

A: Observation is not appropriate as the patient has already been diagnosed with glaucoma and has visual field loss. Close monitoring and follow-up are necessary to prevent further vision loss.

B: Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain/orbits may be necessary in the future to rule out other causes of visual field loss, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this time.

C: Referral to endocrinology may be necessary if the patient's pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency is not being adequately managed, but it is not directly related to the patient's glaucoma and visual field loss.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of fever, dyspnea, and hypotension, along with the physical examination findings of tachycardia, tachypnea, and bilateral lung crackles, suggest a severe respiratory infection with sepsis. The patient's history of hypertension and the presence of a soft S1 on cardiac examination suggest that the patient may have a cardiac condition that could be exacerbating the sepsis. The bedside transthoracic echocardiogram showed a possible cardiac vegetation, which supports the diagnosis of infective endocarditis. Given the severity of the patient's condition, it is appropriate to place an intra-aortic balloon pump to provide hemodynamic support and help stabilize the patient for further management.

Option A, ordering diuresis with furosemide and serial echocardiograms, may be appropriate for a patient with heart failure and pulmonary edema, but it would not address the underlying infective endocarditis or provide adequate hemodynamic support for a severely hypotensive patient.

Option B, performing emergency surgery for aortic valve repair, may be necessary in some cases of infective endocarditis, but it would not be the appropriate next step in this patient's management. The patient's condition is too unstable to undergo surgery, and the presence of a soft S1 suggests that the aortic valve may not be the source of the infection.

Option D, starting broad-spectrum antibiotics and observing, may be appropriate for a patient with suspected infective endocarditis, but it would not provide adequate hemodynamic support for a severely hypotensive patient. In addition, starting antibiotics without proper diagnosis and management of the underlying condition may lead to inadequate treatment and poor outcomes.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as joint contractures, carpal tunnel syndrome, and infiltrated and redundant skin with sheets of waxy papules, are consistent with scleromyxedema. Additionally, the patient's history of papules spreading from the forehead to the face, trunk, and extremities over the course of a year, as well as the presence of swelling and erythema of both ears, are also consistent with this diagnosis. Scleromyxedema is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by the deposition of mucin in the skin and other organs, leading to thickening and hardening of the skin, as well as joint contractures and other symptoms. The patient's laboratory results, including a monoclonal spike on a serum protein electrophoresis test and an IgG λ monoclonal gammopathy, also support this diagnosis. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides [MF]), lepromatous leprosy, and scleroderma are all potential differential diagnoses, but they do not fully align with the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as the gradual and asymptomatic appearance of reddish-brown hyperkeratotic papules on a single limb, are consistent with disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP). DSAP is a rare variant of porokeratosis that is characterized by widespread, small, scaly papules on sun-exposed areas. The histopathological features of the lesional skin biopsy, such as compact hyperkeratosis, epidermal atrophy, and a band-like lymphocyte infiltrate in the superficial dermis, are also consistent with DSAP. The patient's history of diabetes mellitus and lack of other endocrine disorders or malignant neoplasms further support this diagnosis. The other options, such as stucco keratoses, hyperkeratosis lenticularis perstans, and Kyrle disease, can also cause hyperkeratotic papules, but their clinical and histopathological features are not consistent with the patient's presentation. Therefore, option C, disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis, is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including transient episodes of expressive speech difficulties, paroxysmal dizziness, and involuntary nonsuppressible jerks of the right arm, are consistent with faciobrachial dystonic seizures. The synchronized contractions of the right face, arm, and leg that were captured on video EEG also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the absence of any epileptic abnormality on EEG and the unremarkable head MRI suggest that the patient's symptoms are not caused by an epileptic disorder, which would be consistent with a diagnosis of faciobrachial dystonic seizures. Myoclonus (option A) is a possible diagnosis, but it typically presents with sudden, brief muscle jerks, whereas the patient's symptoms are characterized by sustained, synchronized contractions. Paroxysmal dyskinesia (option B) is a movement disorder that can cause involuntary movements, but it typically affects the trunk and limbs bilaterally, rather than just one side of the body. Tic disorder (option D) is also a possible diagnosis, but it typically presents with sudden, brief movements or vocalizations, rather than sustained, synchronized contractions.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of redness and decreased vision in her right eye, along with the physical examination findings of conjunctival injection, cystoid macular edema, and scattered intraretinal hemorrhages, are consistent with a diagnosis of uveitis. The presence of a blunted foveal light reflex and a small pocket of subfoveal subretinal fluid on optical coherence tomography also support this diagnosis. Given the patient's history of hypertension and Cushing disease, it is likely that the uveitis is caused by a systemic inflammatory condition. Performing an intravitreal injection of an antivascular endothelial growth factor agent, such as bevacizumab, would be an appropriate next step in managing this patient's uveitis and reducing the risk of further vision loss. Starting systemic corticosteroids (option B) may also be considered, but the use of intravitreal medication is generally preferred as a first-line treatment for uveitis. Obtaining a laboratory workup for uveitis (option C) may also be helpful in identifying any underlying systemic conditions that may be contributing to the uveitis, but it is not the most urgent step in managing this patient's condition. Ordering cerebral angiography (option D) is not directly related to the patient's current symptoms and examination findings, and therefore would not be the most appropriate next step.

Answer: B
Explanation: Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disorder that affects the nervous system and causes muscle weakness. The patient's symptoms of progressive diplopia and ptosis of the left upper eyelid, along with the restricted abduction of the left eye and substantial resistance to retropulsion, are consistent with MG. The patient's history of smoking and family history of autoimmune diseases (hypertension and type 2 diabetes) also support this diagnosis. A CT scan of the orbits with contrast (Option A) may be useful in identifying any structural abnormalities or inflammation in the orbits, but it is not the most appropriate next step in diagnosing MG. Thyroid function testing (Option D) may also be useful in ruling out other causes of diplopia and ptosis, but it is not directly related to the patient's symptoms. Referral for strabismus surgery (Option C) is not appropriate at this time, as the patient's symptoms are not related to strabismus. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to perform Myasthenia gravis testing (Option B) to confirm the diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation:
The patient's history of herpetic keratitis and postoperative bullous keratopathy without treatment suggests that the corneal lesion may be a manifestation of a chronic viral infection. The pearly white, raised, gelatinous appearance of the lesion, along with its hyperechoic nature on ultrasound biomicroscopy, supports this diagnosis. The cleft between the lesion and the cornea may indicate that the lesion is a separate entity from the surrounding cornea, rather than an infiltration of the cornea itself. Excisional biopsy would be the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of the lesion. Incisional biopsy may not provide a complete picture of the lesion, while local therapy with 5-fluorouracil may not be effective against a viral infection. Observation alone may allow the lesion to progress and potentially cause further complications.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's pruritic rash and hyperpigmented streaks on her arms, back, and legs, as well as the appearance of dark scratch marks, are consistent with paraneoplastic skin disease. This condition is associated with certain types of cancer, including Hodgkin lymphoma, and is caused by the immune system's response to cancer cells. The patient's history of Hodgkin lymphoma and recent chemotherapy treatment support this diagnosis. Bleomycin toxic effects (option A) could also cause a rash, but the patient's symptoms began 15 days after starting chemotherapy, which is later than the typical onset of bleomycin-related side effects. Polymorphic eruption of pregnancy (option C) is a rare condition that occurs during pregnancy, but the patient's history of Hodgkin lymphoma and recent chemotherapy treatment make it less likely. Vinblastine toxic effects (option D) can cause a rash, but the patient's symptoms do not match the typical presentation of vinblastine-related side effects.

The skin biopsy results showing infiltration with lymphoid cells and few histiocytes in the subcutaneous tissue, and the cells showing nuclear positivity for c-Myc on immunohistochemical analysis, are also consistent with Burkitt lymphoma. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's presentation of progressive shortness of breath, lower extremity edema, and tachycardia, along with the physical examination findings of warm extremities, tachycardia, and bibasilar rales on lung auscultation, suggest neurocardiogenic shock. The patient's history of alcohol abuse and the laboratory results of hyponatremia, compensated metabolic acidosis, and elevated lactate concentration support this diagnosis. Neurocardiogenic shock is a life-threatening condition that requires prompt treatment. Administering intravenous bicarbonate therapy (option C) is the most appropriate next step in management, as it can help to correct the metabolic acidosis and improve cardiac function. In contrast, starting extracorporeal membrane oxygenation therapy (option A) may be considered in severe cases of cardiogenic shock, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. Administering intravenous β-blocker therapy (option B) may be considered later in the management of the patient's heart failure, but it is not the most urgent intervention needed at this time. Administering intravenous thiamine therapy (option D) may be considered in cases of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome, but there is no clear indication for this in the patient's presentation.

Answer: B 
Explanation: An epidermoid cyst is a type of developmental cyst that forms from the implantation of epidermal cells into the soft tissue. It is a benign, usually painless, and slow-growing mass. The clinical presentation described in the case, including the patient's age, the location and size of the mass, and the absence of symptoms such as dysphagia, odynophagia, or weight loss, is consistent with an epidermoid cyst. Additionally, the fact that the mass was soft, mobile, and compressible, and that it was visible as a clear blue lesion in the floor of the mouth, also supports this diagnosis. The patient's history of a slowly enlarging mass over a period of 1 year also suggests a benign lesion, as malignant lesions tend to grow more rapidly. The fact that the mass was nontender and that the patient did not have a history of infection also supports this diagnosis, as epidermoid cysts are usually not tender and do not become infected. The CT scan images provided also show a characteristic "ring-like" or "target-like" appearance, which is consistent with an epidermoid cyst. Therefore, based on the clinical presentation and the imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is an epidermoid cyst.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as left facial pain and swelling, epistaxis, and left-sided epiphora, are consistent with a diagnosis of nasal cellulitis. The endoscopic nasal examination findings of substantial swelling of the left nasal vestibule, nearly total septal perforation with areas of necrotic bone, and no identifiable intranasal landmarks except for a remnant of the left middle turbinate, also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the laboratory evaluation results, such as a white blood cell count of 12,300/μL with a normal neutrophil count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 83 mm/h, and a C-reactive protein level of 134 mg/L, are consistent with a diagnosis of nasal cellulitis.

The patient's history of chronic sinusitis and previous treatment with multiple rounds of oral antibiotics and steroids without improvement also support the diagnosis of nasal cellulitis. The patient's social history of routine cocaine use 10 years ago may also be relevant, as cocaine use has been associated with an increased risk of nasal cellulitis.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (option A) is a systemic vasculitis that can affect the nasal passages and sinuses, but it is less likely given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Cocaine-induced midline destructive lesion (option B) is a rare condition that can cause nasal septal perforation and other nasal passages, but it is less likely given the patient's history of chronic sinusitis and the absence of other characteristic findings. Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (option D) is a rare type of cancer that can affect the nasal passages, but it is less likely given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Chronic invasive fungal sinusitis (option D) is a possible diagnosis, but it is less likely given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, as well

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of fever, rash, and migratory polyarthralgias, as well as the negative tests for sexually transmitted infections and respiratory viruses, suggest a possible diagnosis of Lyme disease. Lyme disease is caused by the bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted through the bite of an infected blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis). The patient's exposure to ticks on a farm in Connecticut increases the likelihood of this diagnosis. Obtaining joint fluid for bacterial analysis and cultures would help to confirm the diagnosis, as Lyme disease can cause septic arthritis, which is an infection of the joint fluid. Therefore, option B is the best answer.

Option A, inquiring about rodent and other animal exposures, may also be relevant in the patient's history, but it is not the most appropriate next step in the patient's management.

Option C, testing for Borrelia burgdorferi, is a good idea, but it should be done in addition to, rather than instead of, obtaining joint fluid for bacterial analysis and cultures.

Option D, testing vesicular fluid for enterovirus, is not relevant to the patient's symptoms or possible diagnosis, and therefore is not the best next step.

Explanation: A core needle biopsy would be the next best step in the management of this patient's irregular lipomatous extremity tumor. This is because the patient presents with a large, palpable mass that is suspicious for a soft tissue sarcoma, and a core needle biopsy would allow for a tissue diagnosis to be made prior to surgical excision. Incisional biopsy (option A) would not be appropriate as it would involve a larger incision and may compromise the surgical approach for excision. Simple excision (option C) would not be appropriate as it would not allow for a tissue diagnosis to be made prior to surgery, and repeat imaging in 6 months (option D) would not be appropriate as it would delay diagnosis and treatment of a potentially malignant lesion.

Answer: D Telangiectatic metastatic breast carcinoma.
Explanation: The patient's history of breast cancer, left supraclavicular lymph node metastasis, and the presence of violaceous swelling with telangiectasia and necrosis on the face, predominantly involving the left side, are all consistent with telangiectatic metastatic breast carcinoma. The patient's previous radiation therapy and chemotherapy may have contributed to the development of this condition. Cutaneous angiosarcoma (option A) is a rare malignancy that typically affects the skin and subcutaneous tissue, but it would not explain the patient's history of breast cancer and metastasis. Radiation dermatitis (option B) is a common side effect of radiation therapy, but it would not account for the patient's history of breast cancer and metastasis. Wolf isotopic response (option C) is a rare condition that occurs in patients with breast cancer, but it is not associated with telangiectasia and necrosis on the face. Therefore, option D is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: B 
Explanation: The patient's history of orthotopic liver transplant and use of immunosuppressive drugs, along with the clinical presentation of an annular configuration of violaceous nodules encircling the scar, suggests a diagnosis of posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (pPTLD). pPTLD is a rare complication of solid organ transplantation that can arise from the immunosuppressive drugs used to prevent rejection of the transplanted organ. The patient's history of gastric outlet obstruction secondary to an infiltrative gastric wall mass, which was found to be associated with plasmablastic pPTLD, further supports this diagnosis. The patient's symptoms and radiologic improvement after treatment with CHOP chemotherapy and lenalidomide also suggest that the skin eruption is related to the pPTLD. The histopathological findings of an atypical, hyperchromatic infiltrate in the superficial and deep dermis, with crushed but markedly atypical-appearing lymphoid cells and multiple mitotic and apoptotic figures, are consistent with pPTLD. Reactive granulomatous disorder (option A) is less likely given the absence of a granulomatous response in the biopsy specimen. Deep fungal infection (option C) is unlikely given the absence of clinical signs of infection and the patient's recent treatment with antimicrobials. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (option D) is a possibility, but the patient's history and clinical presentation suggest a more likely diagnosis of pPTLD.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of recurrent strokelike episodes, gait abnormalities, and sensory deficits, along with the family history of similar symptoms, suggest a genetic disorder. X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a genetic disorder that affects the peripheral nervous system and is characterized by progressive weakness and atrophy of the limbs, as well as sensory deficits. The patient's pes planovalgus and tight achilles tendons bilaterally, as well as his bilateral dorsiflexion weakness, are consistent with CMT. The patient's family history, with a mother who has diminished reflexes, hand tremor, and balance issues, and a younger brother with similar gait abnormalities, also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's normal results on the stroke/transient ischemic attack workup and the absence of any evidence of infection or inflammation on the lumbar puncture suggest that the patient's symptoms are not caused by an infectious or inflammatory process. Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and family history, the most likely diagnosis is X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with uveitis, specifically posterior uveitis. The presence of vitritis, hyperemia of the optic nerve, and a large white lesion in the macula are all indicative of inflammation in the posterior segment of the eye. The patient's history of blurry vision and rapid worsening of vision in both eyes also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the fluorescein angiography findings of multiple hyperfluorescent lesions in late frames suggest the presence of vasculitis, which is a known complication of uveitis.

Given the patient's history of HLA B27 positivity and the presence of vasculitis, the most appropriate next step would be to initiate antiviral therapy. This is because HLA B27-associated uveitis is often caused by an immune-mediated response to a viral infection, and antiviral therapy can help to reduce inflammation and prevent further vision loss.

Performing bilateral posterior sub-Tenon triamcinolone injections (option A) may be considered for the treatment of uveitis, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. Increasing the dose of oral prednisone (option B) may also be considered, but it is not the most appropriate next step given the patient's history of HLA B27 positivity and the presence of vasculitis. Initiating intravenous penicillin therapy (option D) is not appropriate, as there is no evidence of a bacterial infection.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of bilateral papilledema and progressive visual loss in the right eye, along with the finding of partially empty sella on MRI, suggest a possible diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). IIH is a condition characterized by increased intracranial pressure without an identifiable cause, and it can present with symptoms similar to those of the patient. The patient's history of Behçet disease and previous treatment with high-dose corticosteroids may also suggest a possible association with IIH. Therefore, obtaining cerebral magnetic resonance venography or computed tomographic venography (Option C) would be the next appropriate step to evaluate the patient's condition and confirm the diagnosis. This imaging study can help to identify any abnormalities in the venous sinuses or dura mater that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms.

Option A, adding immunosuppressant to corticosteroid therapy, may not be effective in treating IIH and may even worsen the patient's condition. Option B, increasing the prednisone dose, may provide some temporary relief for the patient's symptoms but would not address the underlying cause of the condition. Option D, performing catheter cerebral angiography, may be invasive and carry risks, and it may not provide any additional information that would change the patient's management.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination findings, such as bilateral macular lesions, eccentric yellow-clear preretinal lesions, and loss of foveal contour, are consistent with atypical epiretinal membranes. The patient's history of bilateral lateral rectus muscle recession for exotropia and a single oval lightly pigmented macule on her right upper arm suggests a possible association with ocular albinism. However, the patient's medical history and physical examination do not reveal any other signs of albinism. Genetic testing may be helpful in identifying genetic mutations associated with ocular albinism or other retinal diseases, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management. Observation of the lesions may be appropriate for lesions that are not causing symptoms or vision loss, but in this case, the patient's vision is already affected, and the lesions are likely to progress. Intravitreal ocriplasmin injection is a treatment option for some retinal diseases, but it is not appropriate for atypical epiretinal membranes. Pars plana vitrectomy with epiretinal membrane peel is a surgical procedure that can effectively remove the membranes and improve vision. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to recommend pars plana vitrectomy with epiretinal membrane peel.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of ptosis and blurred vision, along with the physical finding of a conjunctival mass, suggest a possible orbital tumor. The patient's history of thyroid cancer and breast cancer also increase the likelihood of a malignant lesion. Therefore, the next step would be to order a complete blood cell count, basic metabolic panel, and liver function tests to assess the patient's overall health and rule out any systemic diseases that may be contributing to the conjunctival lesion. Additionally, liver function tests can help evaluate the patient's liver function, which is important when considering the use of chemotherapy or radiation therapy for the treatment of orbital tumors.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and clinical findings, such as a large, well-demarcated epithelial defect with underlying stromal loss, suggest a possible herpetic keratitis. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a common cause of corneal ulcers, and the presence of an epithelial defect and stromal loss is consistent with HSV keratitis. The patient's history of alcoholism may also suggest a weakened immune system, making him more susceptible to viral infections. Therefore, it would be appropriate to obtain HSV tissue culture and antigen detection tests to confirm the diagnosis.

The other options are not as appropriate for several reasons. Option A, using confocal microscopy to evaluate for cysts, may be useful in diagnosing certain corneal conditions, but it is not specifically indicated in this case given the patient's symptoms and clinical findings. Option C, broadening antibiotic coverage to include vancomycin and tobramycin, may be appropriate if there were signs of bacterial infection, but the patient's cultures were negative, and there is no indication of bacterial keratitis. Option D, obtaining serum vitamin A levels, is not directly related to the patient's symptoms or clinical findings and is not necessary at this stage of management.

Answer: C 
Explanation: The patient's history of radiation therapy and the appearance of numerous pink and brown papules and plaques, some with ulceration, on the head, neck, and spine are consistent with the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). SCC is a common complication of radiation therapy, and it can arise in previously irradiated areas, especially in patients who received radiation at a young age. The patient's family history of similar cutaneous lesions in two brothers and one niece also supports this diagnosis. Angiosarcoma (option A) is a rare malignancy that can arise in irradiated tissues, but it typically affects the skin and soft tissues in a more widespread and aggressive manner. Leukemia cutis (option B) is a rare condition characterized by the infiltration of the skin by leukemic cells, but it typically presents with more widespread and numerous skin lesions. Basal cell carcinoma (option D) is less likely given the patient's history of radiation therapy and the appearance of the lesions.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive painful reddening and swelling of the left thigh, along with the clinical findings of diffuse erythematous induration and multiple small palpable subcutaneous nonindurated nodules, are consistent with nivolumab-induced extensive panniculitis. The patient's history of melanoma and previous treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the fluorine 18 (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT) findings of multiple FDG-active lesions in both lower extremities and the lumbar region, as well as the absence of signs of vasculitis on biopsy, further support the diagnosis of panniculitis. The absence of specific autoimmune antigens on direct immunofluorescence and blood analysis also suggests that the panniculitis is not autoimmune in nature, but rather a side effect of the nivolumab therapy. Therefore, option B, Nivolumab-induced extensive panniculitis, is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient presents with acute, worsening dyspnea, elevated jugular venous pressure, bilateral rales in her lungs, and reduced intensity of the mitral valve closure sound, which suggests a severe respiratory distress. Additionally, the echocardiographic image showed a mean gradient of 12 mm Hg across the mitral valve, indicating valve stenosis, and a large thrombus on the mechanical mitral valve. These findings indicate that the patient is experiencing an acute thromboembolic event, which requires immediate treatment.
Administering a full dose of emergency tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) would be the most appropriate next step, as it is a proven treatment for acute thromboembolic events. tPA works by breaking down blood clots and restoring blood flow to the affected area. In this case, it would help to dissolve the thrombus on the mechanical mitral valve and improve the patient's respiratory distress.
Referring the patient for aortic root dissection repair (Option A) may be necessary in the long term, but it is not the most urgent step in the patient's care. Starting intravenous heparin (Option B) may also be appropriate, but it would not address the acute thromboembolic event and may not be effective in dissolving the thrombus. Performing emergency percutaneous clot removal (Option D) may also be considered, but it would require additional imaging and may not be necessary if tPA is effective in dissolving the clot.

Answer: D. Sebaceous carcinoma.
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as a gradually enlarging mass over the right frontal sinus, and the CT scan findings of bony destruction and an air pocket within the mass, are consistent with a diagnosis of sebaceous carcinoma. The histopathological findings of large nests of neoplastic epithelioid cells surrounded by fibrotic tissue and necroinflammatory debris, and the neoplastic cells containing round nuclei with single prominent nucleoli and abundant clear to vacuolated cytoplasm, are also consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of tobacco abuse and the location of the mass over the right frontal sinus are risk factors for the development of sebaceous carcinoma.

The other options are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and CT scan findings. Pott puffy tumor (option A) is a benign lesion that typically affects the scalp and does not have the same degree of bony destruction or air pocket within the mass as seen in this case. Mucocele (option B) is a benign lesion that arises from the salivary glands and typically presents as a painless mass in the neck or face. Basal cell carcinoma (option C) is a type of skin cancer that can present with a variety of clinical appearances, but the patient's symptoms and CT scan findings are not consistent with this diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive hearing loss, vertigo, asthenia, sleep disorders, and urinary frequency, along with the physical examination findings of right horizontal nystagmus, poorly delineated hypoesthesia of the left pinna, and absence of otoacoustic emissions on the left side, are consistent with a diagnosis of toxoplasmosis. The patient's history of swimming in Lake Tanganyika, where he was likely exposed to Toxoplasma gondii, supports this diagnosis. The presence of a hemorrhagic lesion in the left middle cerebellar peduncle and thickening of the cochleovestibular nerve on imaging studies also suggest a diagnosis of toxoplasmosis. The patient's urinary frequency, which has been treated for 2 years without improvement, may be related to a bladder manifestation of toxoplasmosis. The other options, prostate cancer with brain metastasis, tuberculosis, and schistosomiasis, do not explain the patient's symptoms and examination findings as well as toxoplasmosis.

Answer: C
Explanation:
The clinical presentation of verrucous plaques over the helix of the ear and cervical lymphadenopathy, along with the histopathological findings of granulomatous inflammation and central caseous necrosis in the dermis, are consistent with cutaneous tuberculosis. The presence of acid-fast bacilli on Ziehl-Neelsen stain further supports this diagnosis. Cutaneous tuberculosis can present in various forms, including verrucous plaques, ulcers, and nodules. The involvement of the ear and neck lymph nodes suggests a likely spread of infection from a primary site, such as the respiratory tract.

The other options do not fit the clinical and histopathological findings:

A. Fixed cutaneous sporotrichosis: This is a chronic fungal infection that typically presents with verrucous lesions on the skin, but the presence of granulomatous inflammation and acid-fast bacilli on Ziehl-Neelsen stain is not consistent with this diagnosis.

B. Lupus vulgaris: This is a chronic autoimmune disease that can cause skin lesions, but the presence of granulomatous inflammation and acid-fast bacilli on Ziehl-Neelsen stain is not consistent with this diagnosis.

D. Cutaneous leishmaniasis: This is a parasitic infection that can cause skin lesions, but the presence of granulomatous inflammation and acid-fast bacilli on Ziehl-Neelsen stain is not consistent with this diagnosis.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: Atypical mycobacterial infection (cutaneous tuberculosis).

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a possible diagnosis of meningitis or encephalitis. Although the patient does not have a fever, meningitis or encephalitis can present with a low-grade fever or even without fever. The patient's neck stiffness and positive Kernig sign are consistent with meningitis. The laboratory results show a mild leukocytosis with a predominance of neutrophils, which is consistent with bacterial meningitis. Additionally, the patient's history of pseudogout and kidney transplant increases the likelihood of infection. Therefore, obtaining additional imaging with CT is appropriate to further evaluate the patient's condition and to rule out other possible causes of meningitis or encephalitis.

Answer: C 
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of bilateral temporal headache and blurred vision are concerning for giant cell arteritis (GCA), which is a vasculitis that affects the medium and large arteries, including the temporal arteries. The ESR of 110 mm/h supports the diagnosis of GCA, as an elevated ESR is commonly seen in this condition. However, the temporal artery biopsy result was normal, which may indicate that the patient does not have GCA. Therefore, the next step would be to consider an alternative diagnosis for the patient's symptoms. Sumatriptan is a medication that is commonly used to treat migraines, which could be an alternative diagnosis for the patient's symptoms. It is important to note that the patient's age and symptoms also put her at risk for other conditions such as stroke or TIA, so further evaluation with imaging or other tests may also be appropriate.

The patient's history of lip enlargement with nodular growths, extension onto the vermilion border, and absence of intraoral lesions, are consistent with leukemia labialis. The patient's age and absence of other symptoms also support this diagnosis. Granulomatous cheilitis (A) is a rare condition characterized by the formation of granulomas on the lips, often associated with autoimmune disorders. Lip licker's dermatitis (C) is a condition characterized by erythematous and scaly lesions on the lips, caused by chronic licking of the lips. Pyostomatitis vegetans (D) is a rare condition characterized by recurrent, painful ulcers on the lips and oral mucosa, often associated with inflammatory bowel disease. While the patient's symptoms could potentially be consistent with any of these conditions, the absence of other symptoms and the patient's history of lip enlargement with nodular growths, support the diagnosis of leukemia labialis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including the pruritic, annular plaques with pustules on the face, trunk, upper extremities, and feet, are consistent with eosinophilic pustular folliculitis (EPF). EPF is a chronic skin condition characterized by recurrent, pruritic, and papulopustular lesions that often involve the face, trunk, and extremities. The patient's history of worsening hand dermatitis that progressed to involve other areas of his body is also consistent with EPF. Additionally, the histopathology results shown in Figures C and D support the diagnosis of EPF, as they reveal a dense infiltrate of eosinophils and neutrophils in the dermis, along with follicular plugging and peripheral eosinophilic inflammation. While folliculotropic mycosis fungoides (Answer A) and papulopustular rosacea (Answer B) can also present with papulopustular lesions, they typically do not involve the extremities or have the same histopathological features as EPF. Majocchi granuloma (Answer D) is a rare condition that typically presents with larger, more indurated plaques and nodules, and is often associated with a history of insect bites or other environmental triggers.

Answer: D: Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL)

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of transient right upper extremity weakness and word-finding difficulty associated with headache, new intermittent vertigo, and more frequent and severe throbbing migraine with transient blurry vision and nonpulsatile tinnitus, along with the physical examination findings of diminished hearing to a finger rub on the right side and fundoscopy showing several segmental retinal arterial plaques, are consistent with the diagnosis of CADASIL. The patient's history of episodic migraine with visual aura and the presence of hyperintensities on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging (FLAIR) also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's negative infectious, rheumatologic, and hypercoaguable test results, as well as the normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose and IgG index test results, rule out other potential causes of her symptoms.

The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and examination findings as well as CADASIL does. Multiple sclerosis (option A) is a possibility, but the patient's symptoms and examination findings are not typical of MS, and the presence of segmental retinal arterial plaques argues against this diagnosis. Behçet disease (option B) can cause similar symptoms, but the patient's negative infectious and rheumatologic test results make this diagnosis less likely. Susac syndrome (option C) is a rare condition that can cause similar symptoms, but it typically affects younger patients and has a more rapid course, and the patient's negative infectious and rheumatologic test results argue against this diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of sudden onset of photopsia and visual disturbances described as "fixed swirl circles" in the central vision of both eyes, along with the physical examination findings of pain and discomfort during movements of the right eye, suggest a possible diagnosis of acute macular neuroretinopathy (AMN). The near-infrared reflectance imaging and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans of the right eye shown in the figure support this diagnosis, as they reveal hyporeflective teardrop-shaped lesions and increased reflectivity of the outer plexiform layer, respectively. AMN is a rare condition that is often associated with migraine, as in this patient's case. It is important to rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a posterior circulation stroke or a retinal artery occlusion, which could be detected by a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. Therefore, the next step would be to perform an MRI of the brain to rule out these conditions and confirm the diagnosis of AMN.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and clinical findings, including giant follicles and papillary reaction, suggest a diagnosis of asymptomatic follicular conjunctivitis. The patient's history of soft contact lens wear and recent upper respiratory tract illness increase the likelihood of this diagnosis. A chest radiography and angiotensin-converting enzyme serum level test may be necessary to rule out other potential causes of follicular conjunctivitis, such as sarcoidosis. Starting an empirical trial of oral azithromycin (option A) may not be necessary at this point, as the patient's symptoms have improved with topical steroids, and there is no evidence of a bacterial infection. Proceeding with conjunctival biopsy (option C) may be premature and may not provide conclusive results.

Answer: D
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and findings are consistent with monocular crystalline maculopathy, a rare condition characterized by the accumulation of refractile crystals in the macula. The presence of crystals on the surface of the inner limiting membrane and in the vitreous suggests that the crystals are not derived from the retinal pigment epithelium, which would support the diagnosis of monocular crystalline maculopathy.

The patient's history of slightly blurry vision in his right eye, without any other ocular complaints, and the absence of any abnormalities on biomicroscopy, fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography of the posterior pole, also support this diagnosis.

Given the patient's occupation as a metal worker, it is possible that he has been exposed to chemicals or heavy metals that could be associated with this condition. Therefore, screening for intravenous abuse of opioids and other substances (option D) would be an appropriate next step in the patient's workup, as it could help identify a potential cause of the crystalline deposits.

The other options do not seem as relevant to the patient's presentation and diagnosis:

* Option A, requesting a genetic workup, may be appropriate in some cases of monocular crystalline maculopathy, but it is not clear that it would be helpful in this case, given the patient's occupation and lack of family history.
* Option B, examining the retinal periphery, may be necessary in some cases of monocular crystalline maculopathy to assess for any peripheral retinal abnormalities, but it is not clear that it would be diagnostic in this case.
* Option C, measuring oxalate levels in blood and urine, may be relevant in some cases of monocular crystalline maculopathy, as oxalate crystals have been implicated in some cases of this condition. However, it is not clear that this test would be helpful in this case, given the patient's occupation and lack of other symptoms.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of throbbing headaches, lightheadedness, and visual disturbances, along with the physical examination findings of Frisen grade 5 optic nerve head swelling, flame hemorrhages, and nerve fiber layer infarcts, suggest a possible diagnosis of hypertensive retinopathy. The patient's history of acute kidney failure and non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction also support this diagnosis. Therefore, the next step would be to perform magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance venogram of the brain and orbits to rule out any intracranial causes of hypertension, followed by a lumbar puncture to evaluate for possible central nervous system inflammation or infection. Controlling the systemic blood pressure and working up the underlying cause of hypertension (Option A) is important but would not provide the necessary information to diagnose and manage the patient's optic nerve head edema.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's high hemoglobin level, red blood cell count, and lymphocytosis, as well as the absence of cellular atypia and epidermal involvement in the skin biopsy, suggest a diagnosis of polycythemia rubra vera (PRV). PRV is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by an overproduction of red blood cells, which can lead to a florid, erythematous macular eruption. The patient's symptoms of itching and the absence of hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy also support this diagnosis. The patient's age and the presence of lymphocytosis also make PRV a more likely diagnosis than T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia (A) or advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma/Sézary syndrome (B). Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (D) is less likely given the absence of epidermal involvement and the lack of typical histological features of lupus on the skin biopsy.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of acute chest pain, along with the imaging findings of multiple coronary artery aneurysms and a perivascular soft-tissue mass, suggests a diagnosis of IgG4-related coronary artery disease. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the appropriate next step in management, as it can help to treat the aneurysms and restore blood flow to the affected vessels. High-dose corticosteroid therapy may also be considered as a potential treatment option, but it would not be the most appropriate next step in management. Immunosuppressant therapy may be considered in certain cases of IgG4-related disease, but it is not typically used as a first-line treatment for coronary artery disease. Coronary artery bypass graft surgery may be considered for patients with severe coronary artery disease, but it would not be the most appropriate next step in management for this patient given the presence of aneurysms and the potential for PCI to effectively treat the disease.

Explanation: The patient's history of a 45-pack-year smoking history and social drinking, combined with the physical examination findings of submucosal masses without tenderness or mucosal abnormality, and the CT scan findings of hyperenhancing nodules, are consistent with a diagnosis of basal cell adenocarcinoma (B). Basal cell adenocarcinoma is a type of skin cancer that typically affects the elderly and is associated with a history of sun exposure and smoking. The multifocal nature of the nodules and the absence of local bony erosion or cervical lymphadenopathy also support this diagnosis.

The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and examination findings as well. Multifocal basal cell adenoma (A) is a rare condition that typically affects the paranasal sinuses and is not associated with a history of smoking or drinking. Multifocal canalicular adenoma (C) is also a rare condition that typically affects the lacrimal gland and is not associated with a history of smoking or drinking. Adenoid cystic carcinoma (D) is a malignant tumor that can affect various parts of the head and neck, but it typically presents with pain, bleeding, or other symptoms, and is not associated with a history of smoking or drinking.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's history of recurrent, painful, and slightly pruritic skin lesions on his right flank, with alternating periods of increase and decrease in number and degree of pain, suggests a diagnosis of herpes zoster (shingles). The presence of vesicles filled with clear and milky-white fluid in the periphery of the cluster of lesions and the absence of warmth or induration in the surrounding skin also support this diagnosis. Herpes zoster is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, and oral valacyclovir is an effective treatment for this condition. Therefore, option B, prescribing oral valacyclovir, is the best next step in management. Option A, biopsy the lesions, may be necessary if the diagnosis is not clear, but it is not the most appropriate next step given the patient's history and physical examination findings. Option C, prescribing topical cantharadin, may be useful for some skin conditions, but it is not typically used to treat herpes zoster. Option D, recommending a gluten-free diet, has no scientific basis in the management of herpes zoster and is therefore not a viable option.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and rebound tenderness, along with the finding of mesenteric vascular compromise on the CT scan, suggest a possible bowel obstruction or ischemia. The appropriate next step would be to proceed with an exploratory laparotomy to evaluate the bowel and mesentery for any damage or obstruction. This would allow for a thorough assessment of the patient's condition and enable the surgeon to perform any necessary interventions, such as bowel resection or repair of any vascular compromise. The other options, while they may be considered in the differential diagnosis, are not as immediately necessary or appropriate given the patient's severe symptoms and recent history of gastric bypass surgery.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's pancytopenia, particularly the anemia and thrombocytopenia, may be caused by a deficiency in vitamins and minerals, such as iron, copper, and zinc, which are essential for hematopoiesis. The patient's history of RYGB surgery and weight loss may have led to a deficiency in these nutrients. Therefore, it is appropriate to check the patient's serum trace element levels, including iron, copper, and zinc, to determine if there is a deficiency that can be treated with supplements. Option B is the best choice because it addresses the possible underlying cause of the patient's pancytopenia. Option A, checking serum trace element levels, is not specific enough, as it does not address the patient's clinical presentation. Option C, performing endoscopy of the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract, may be necessary to evaluate the patient's gastrointestinal symptoms, but it is not directly related to the patient's pancytopenia. Option D, starting an erythropoiesis-stimulating agent, may be appropriate if the patient's anemia is caused by a deficiency in erythropoietin, but it is not the most appropriate step at this point in the patient's management.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and histopathologic findings are consistent with herpes virus infection. The presence of multinucleated keratinocytes in the adjacent epidermis and the subepidermal blister suggest a viral etiology. Additionally, the patient's history of recurrent lesions with a symptom-free period of 2 years supports this diagnosis. Linear IgA bullous dermatosis typically presents with tense blisters on the trunk and extremities, and the histopathology shows a subepidermal blister with a granulocytic infiltrate, which is not seen in this case. Cryothermic dermatitis artefacta is a rare condition that is caused by exposure to cold and is characterized by circular or oval erythematous patches with a central area of pallor, but the histopathology does not show the characteristic picture of confluent necrosis of the upper epidermal layers. Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune disease that presents with large, tense blisters on the trunk and extremities, and the histopathology shows a subepidermal blister with a dense lymphocytic infiltrate, which is not seen in this case.

Answer: C 
Explanation: The clinical presentation of flexural hyperpigmentation with reticulation in an adolescent girl, along with the histopathological findings of mild epidermal hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, spongiosis, and an enhanced basal layer pigmentation, are consistent with a diagnosis of Dowling-Degos disease. This condition is characterized by reticulated, brown or black, hyperpigmented patches on the flexural areas of the skin, often associated with pruritus and papules. The histopathological features, such as spongiosis, basal cell vacuolization, and melanin incontinence, also support this diagnosis. The absence of a family history and the presence of normal thyroid function and IgE levels further support this diagnosis. Prurigo pigmentosa (B) is a possible differential diagnosis, but the absence of crusting and scaling, and the presence of reticulation, argue against this diagnosis. Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis (A) is also a possible differential diagnosis, but the absence of papillomatosis and the presence of spongiosis argue against this diagnosis. Lichen planus pigmentosus (D) is a rare condition that can present with similar clinical features, but the absence of characteristic histopathological features, such as dense lymphocytic infiltrate and epidermal atrophy, argue against this diagnosis.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of episodic joint pain and cutaneous eruption, which are not triggered by pulmonary exacerbations or antibiotic use, are consistent with cystic fibrosis-associated episodic arthritis. This condition is characterized by recurrent episodes of joint pain and swelling, often accompanied by a salmon-pink maculopapular rash. The patient's age and history of cystic fibrosis also support this diagnosis. Systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (Option A) is less likely, as it typically presents with more persistent joint symptoms and a longer duration of morning stiffness. Hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (Option C) is unlikely, as it is not typically associated with joint pain or cutaneous eruptions. A serum sickness-like reaction (Option D) is also unlikely, as it typically occurs in response to medication or infection and is not associated with recurrent episodes of joint pain and cutaneous eruptions.

Answer: C. Diabetic striatopathy.

Explanation: Diabetic striatopathy, also known as diabetic encephalopathy, is a rare complication of type 2 diabetes. It is characterized by bilateral striatal degeneration, which can result in various movement disorders, including chorea. The patient's persistent chorea in the left upper extremity, despite aggressive correction of blood glucose levels, suggests that the underlying cause is not solely related to hyperglycemia. The patient's history of long-standing type 2 diabetes, neuropathy, and retinopathy, along with the negative results for infections and autoimmune disorders, support the diagnosis of diabetic striatopathy. The T1 hyperintensity in the right caudate head and lentiform nucleus observed on brain MRI are also consistent with diabetic striatopathy. Olanzapine, an antipsychotic medication, is sometimes used off-label to treat chorea associated with diabetic striatopathy, as in this case, which resulted in the complete resolution of chorea.

The other options do not fit the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory results:

A. Postinfectious/autoimmune chorea: The patient did not have any evidence of infection or autoimmune disorders, and his chorea did not resolve with metabolic correction.

B. Paraneoplastic chorea: There was no evidence of cancer or paraneoplastic syndrome in the patient's history or laboratory results.

D. Acute stroke: The patient did not have any signs or symptoms of acute stroke, and the MRI findings were not consistent with stroke.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of chronic eye redness and pain, along with the physical examination findings of trace hyperemia and diffuse scleral hyperemia, suggest that she may have a type of uveitis that is not responding to the current medication regimen. Increasing the oral corticosteroids dosage to 40 mg daily may help to reduce the inflammation and alleviate the patient's symptoms. It is important to note that the patient has a history of asthma and hypereosinophilic syndrome, which may also need to be addressed in the treatment plan. Performing a scleral biopsy (option B) may not be necessary at this time, as the patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with uveitis. Increasing the frequency of topical corticosteroid use (option C) may not be effective in reducing the inflammation, as the patient has already been using topical corticosteroids four times daily without improvement. Increasing the azathioprine dosage to 500 mg daily (option D) may not be appropriate, as the patient's symptoms do not suggest a need for immunosuppression therapy at this time.

Answer: C: Full-field electroretinogram
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of central scotoma and blurry vision in the right eye, along with the physical examination findings of pseudophakia and mild cataract, suggest a possible retinal etiology. The SD-OCT scan shows segmental atrophy of the inner retina, which is consistent with a retinal degenerative condition. A full-field electroretinogram (ERG) would be the next appropriate step to further evaluate the retinal function and help confirm the diagnosis. An OCT angiography (Option A) may also be useful in evaluating the retinal vasculature, but it would not provide the same level of information about retinal function as an ERG. Automated visual field testing (Option B) may also be useful in evaluating the extent of the visual field defect, but it would not provide information about the underlying retinal pathophysiology. Microperimetry (Option D) may also be useful in evaluating the retinal function, but it would not be as comprehensive as a full-field ERG.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's current symptoms and examination findings suggest an episode of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in the left eye, which was previously treated with medications and resolved. However, the patient's vision has decreased again, and the IOP measured by GAT is now 6 mm Hg, which is lower than the initial reading of 46 mm Hg. This could indicate that the trabeculitis has worsened, and the IOP is now suppressed due to the medications. The shallow fluid interface between the stromal bed and the LASIK flap, as seen in the slitlamp photograph, suggests that the LASIK flap may be causing a blockage in the trabecular meshwork, leading to the elevated IOP.

Therefore, the next step would be to recheck the IOP with a handheld tonometer off the LASIK flap to confirm if the IOP is indeed suppressed, and to assess the effectiveness of the current treatment. If the IOP is still elevated, further treatment may be necessary to address the underlying trabeculitis. Increasing the frequency of prednisolone administration may help to reduce inflammation, but it is not the most appropriate step at this time. Injecting foscarnet sodium intravitreally is not indicated for this condition, and reassuring the patient and rechecking IOP in 1 week may not address the underlying issue promptly enough.

Answer: B 
Explanation: Based on the clinical presentation and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is retinoblastoma. The patient's symptoms of mild periorbital edema and low-grade eye pain, along with the physical examination findings of trace eyelid edema and mild leukocoria, are consistent with this diagnosis. The mass in the macular region, as seen on dilated ophthalmoscopic examination and B-scan ultrasonography, is also consistent with retinoblastoma. The absence of tumor-feeding vessels and ill-defined tumor margins support this diagnosis. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy may not be necessary in this case, as the imaging findings are highly suggestive of retinoblastoma. Therefore, the best next step would be to treat the patient with plaque radiotherapy, which is a common treatment for retinoblastoma. Intra-arterial chemotherapy may also be considered, but it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient. Oral corticosteroids are not typically used to treat retinoblastoma, and may not be effective in shrinking the tumor.

Answer: C: Perform an incisional biopsy.
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive proptosis, worsening vision, and tearing in the right eye, along with the physical examination findings of a firm, nontender mass in the right superotemporal orbit and erythematous and prominent palpebral lobe of the right lacrimal gland, suggest a possible diagnosis of a lacrimal gland tumor. The patient's history of breast cancer and benign thyroid nodules also increase the likelihood of a tumor. An incisional biopsy would be the next step to confirm the diagnosis and determine the nature of the tumor. This would help guide further management and treatment.

Option A, arranging a 6-month follow-up, is not appropriate at this time as the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a potentially urgent condition that requires further evaluation and management.

Option B, obtaining additional imaging, may be considered, but an incisional biopsy would still be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine the nature of the tumor.

Option D, performing an excisional biopsy, may also be considered, but an incisional biopsy would be a more appropriate first step to minimize the risk of complications and allow for a more targeted surgical approach if necessary.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of painless ptosis and intermittent diplopia, along with the physical findings of mild anisocoria and unequal pupillary size, suggest a possible diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. The patient's history of resection of a benign thyroid mass may also be relevant, as thyroid disease can sometimes be associated with myasthenia gravis. Therefore, it would be appropriate to check myasthenia laboratory findings and commence a pyridostigmine trial to confirm the diagnosis and assess the patient's response to treatment. Imaging studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomographic imaging of the orbits, may also be considered to rule out other potential causes of ptosis, but they are not the most appropriate next step in this case. Müller muscle conjunctival resection and external levator advancement are surgical procedures that may be considered for the treatment of ptosis, but they are not appropriate at this stage of the patient's evaluation.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of excessive coughing with hemoptysis and constant, bothersome sweating of the left forehead are consistent with compression or invasion of the left sympathetic trunk. The coronal computed tomographic image of the thorax (Figure 1A) suggests possible compression or invasion of the sympathetic nerve by the left upper lobe mass. The radiation planning computed tomographic image (Figure 1B) taken 2 weeks after initial presentation shows growth of the left upper lobe tumor, which may have further compromised the sympathetic nerve. Therefore, option B, impingement of the left sympathetic trunk, is the most likely explanation for the patient's symptoms.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient presented with a wide complex tachycardia (VT) with hemodynamic instability, which suggests a high risk of sudden cardiac death. While the patient's coronary angiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging results were normal, the presence of recurrent VT despite normal test results suggests that the patient may have a substrate for arrhythmia that is not yet identified. In this case, oral antiarrhythmic therapy with a class I or III agent would be appropriate to control the arrhythmia and prevent sudden cardiac death. Discharge with oral β-blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker may not effectively control the arrhythmia and may not be appropriate given the patient's history of hypertension. Placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator may be considered in the future if the patient continues to experience recurrent VT despite antiarrhythmic therapy. Electrophysiology study with possible catheter ablation may also be considered, but it is not the most appropriate next step given the patient's history of syncope and hemodynamic instability.

Answer: C
Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of a growing mass in the right oropharynx, causing changes in her voice, globus sensation, and dysphagia, along with a 20-pound weight loss over 3 months and decreased appetite, are consistent with a diagnosis of a mixed lymphatic and venous malformation (option C). The patient's age and lack of other symptoms also support this diagnosis.

Squamous cell carcinoma (option A) is a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's age and the absence of other symptoms such as pain, fever, or difficulty breathing.

Hemangioma (option B) is a benign vascular tumor that can occur in the head and neck, but it is unlikely in this case given the patient's symptoms and the size of the mass.

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (option D) is a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's age and the absence of other symptoms such as fever, night sweats, or lymphadenopathy.

Answer: C
Explanation: Neuroborreliosis, also known as Lyme neuroborreliosis, is a complication of Lyme disease that affects the nervous system. Cranial polyneuritis is a manifestation of neuroborreliosis that affects multiple cranial nerves, including the facial nerve. The patient's symptoms of complete right facial nerve paralysis, followed by new-onset right-sided hearing loss, tinnitus, and intermittent otalgia, are consistent with cranial polyneuritis. The MRI findings of abnormal linear and smooth enhancement of the right facial nerve in the superior distal IAC, labyrinthine segment, and geniculate ganglion, as well as discrete enhancement within the inferior aspect of the right IAC in the region of the vestibulocochlear nerve, are also consistent with neuroborreliosis. The patient's history of frequenting wooded areas and the absence of any other otologic history or noise exposure suggest that Lyme disease is a likely cause of his symptoms. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Neuroborreliosis cranial polyneuritis.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of increasingly labored breathing, xerostomia, and poor bowel movements, along with the physical examination findings of symmetrical submucosal swelling of the floor of the mouth and a midline external punctum in the submental area, are consistent with a foregut duplication cyst. The imaging findings of a midline sublingual lesion extending inferiorly through the mylohyoid muscle, with a thin-walled, multiloculated lesion measuring approximately 2.0 × 2.5 × 3.2 cm, also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the fact that the mass was bright on T2-weighted imaging and dark on T1-weighted imaging, and did not enhance with intravenous gadolinium, suggests that it is not a macrocystic lymphatic malformation, cystic teratoma, or dermoid cyst. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is foregut duplication cyst.

The presence of epithelioid histiocytes with macrophages containing coarse black granular pigment in the skin biopsy sample suggests that the inflammation may be related to the tattoo ink. The patient's history of recurrent episodes of ocular redness and blurred vision, coincident with inflammation of the skin surrounding both tattoos, further supports this diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's history and physical examination suggest a diagnosis of scabies. The presence of multiple disseminated, edematous, pin-sized, papulopustulovesicles and coalescing, crusted nodules all over the body, with oval to elongated, serpiginous or J-shaped burrows, is consistent with the characteristic rash of scabies. The absence of excoriations and the presence of burrows suggest that the rash is not caused by an allergic reaction or irritation. The fact that the babysitter who had contact with the infant reported pruritus, especially at night, suggests that the infant may have been exposed to scabies mites. Skin scraping of burrows from multiple sites is the appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis, as it can reveal the presence of scabies mites, eggs, or feces. Administering intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics (option A) would not be effective against scabies, as it is a parasitic infection. Starting a topical steroid (option B) may help with the itching and inflammation, but it would not treat the underlying cause of the rash. Doing nothing and reassuring the parents (option D) would not be appropriate, as the infant's symptoms and rash suggest a treatable condition that requires further evaluation and management.

Additionally, the histopathological findings of pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia and dermal neutrophilia with microabscesses and eosinophilia support this diagnosis. Pyoderma gangrenosum (option A) typically presents with ulcerative lesions and a characteristic "punched-out" appearance, which is not seen in this case. Blastomycosis (option B) is a systemic fungal infection that can cause skin lesions, but it is unlikely given the patient's negative HIV status and the absence of other systemic symptoms.

Answer: C
Explanation: Atrophia maculosa varioliformis cutis, also known as "Swiss cheese skin," is a rare skin condition characterized by multiple small, round or oval, shallow depressions on the skin, which give it a varioliform appearance. The condition typically affects the face, particularly the malar and preauricular areas, and is often associated with a history of trauma, infection, or inflammation. The patient's history of persistent round lesions with a scar-like appearance on his face, symmetric and bilateral, located especially on the malar and preauricular areas, with a diameter of 5 to 10 mm, and the absence of epidermal changes or induration, are consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of no previous inflammation and no history of chicken pox or acne or traumatic lesions in those areas, makes other options less likely. A punch biopsy would be needed to confirm the diagnosis.

Therefore, option C, Atrophia maculosa varioliformis cutis, is the most likely diagnosis for the patient's condition.

Option A, Primary anetoderma, is a rare skin condition characterized by the development of multiple small, soft, and mobile skin lesions that are usually flesh-colored or slightly pigmented. It is not typically associated with a history of trauma, infection, or inflammation, and the lesions are usually not scar-like or atrophic.

Option B, Atrophoderma vermiculata, is a rare skin condition characterized by the development of small, round or oval, shallow depressions on the skin, similar to Atrophia maculosa varioliformis cutis. However, it typically affects the trunk and extremities, rather than the face, and is often associated with a history of sun exposure.

Option D, Facial morphea, is a rare skin condition characterized by the development of large, oval or round, indurated plaques on the face. It is often associated with a history of sun exposure and is not typically symmetric or bilateral.

It is important to note that a punch biopsy would be needed to confirm the diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's history of IgA kappa multiple myeloma and the absence of other skin lesions or lymphadenopathy suggest a diagnosis of plasmacytoma. Plasmacytoma is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is typically found in the bone marrow, but can also occur in extramedullary sites, such as the skin. The patient's age and medical history increase the likelihood of this diagnosis. The shiny, tense, erythematous papule on the glans penis is consistent with the appearance of plasmacytoma. The patient's lack of sexual risk behavior and absence of recent changes in medication also support this diagnosis.

The other options are less likely:

A. Primary penile B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a rare type of cancer that typically affects the penis in older men. However, the patient's history of multiple myeloma and the absence of other skin lesions or lymphadenopathy make this diagnosis less likely.

B. Kaposi sarcoma of the penis is a rare type of cancer that typically affects the skin and lymph nodes. It is more common in people with HIV infection or those taking immunosuppressive medications. The patient's lack of sexual risk behavior and absence of lymphadenopathy make this diagnosis less likely.

D. Primary nodular amyloidosis of the glans penis is a rare condition that typically affects the skin and organs. It is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid deposits in the tissues. The patient's lack of other skin lesions or organomegaly makes this diagnosis less likely.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of right groin pain and difficulty voiding, along with the presence of a palpable and partially reducible mass in the right groin, suggest the presence of an inguinal hernia. The fact that the mass extends into the scrotum and the patient has a history of Childs B cirrhosis increase the likelihood of an Amyand hernia, which is a type of inguinal hernia that includes the appendix within the hernia sac. The presence of leukocyturia and a positive urine culture for Streptococcus viridians suggest that the patient may have an infected hernia. The reduction of right renal function on renography supports the diagnosis of an Amyand hernia, as the appendix can compress or kink the ureter, leading to renal impairment. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Amyand hernia (appendix included within the inguinal hernia sac).

Answer: C
Explanation: Ileo-colic intussusception is a type of intestinal obstruction that occurs when a portion of the small intestine slides into another section of the small intestine, creating a telescoping effect. This can cause abdominal pain, vomiting, and an elevated white blood cell count, which are all symptoms present in the patient's case. The patient's history of sudden onset of severe abdominal pain, along with the physical examination findings of diffuse abdominal tenderness, are also consistent with intussusception. Additionally, the contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic CT scan shows an edematous small intestinal loop on the left abdomen, which is consistent with intussusception.

The other options are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms. Crohn's ileitis (option A) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that can cause abdominal pain and diarrhea, but it is not typically associated with intussusception. Foreign body ingestion (option B) can also cause abdominal pain and vomiting, but it is unlikely in this case given the patient's history and physical examination findings.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of a new central scotoma in the right eye, sluggishly reactive pupil, and relative afferent pupillary defect suggest a possible diagnosis of fungal endophthalmitis. This is a sight-threatening condition that requires prompt treatment. The presence of a positive CMV IgG antibody and an undetectable CMV load before transplantation suggests that the patient may have had a reactivation of CMV retinitis, which can cause fungal endophthalmitis.

Performing a vitreous tap and administering intravitreal injection of antifungal agents (Option B) is the most appropriate next step in management. This will help to treat the possible fungal infection and prevent further visual loss.

Option A, ordering brain neuroimaging and lumbar puncture, may be necessary later on to rule out other causes of central scotoma, but it is not the most urgent step in management.

Option C, performing a vitreous tap and administering intravenous ganciclovir treatment, may be appropriate if the patient has a positive viral load, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management given the patient's history of CMV IgG antibodies and undetectable CMV load before transplantation.

Option D, administering systemic steroid treatment, may be considered later on to reduce inflammation, but it is not the most urgent step in management given the possibility of fungal endophthalmitis.

Answer: A: Chorioretinal biopsy
Explanation: A chorioretinal biopsy would be the next step in the management of this patient's choroidal infiltrate of unknown cause. The patient's history of breast cancer and recent cardiac issues suggest a possible systemic inflammatory or neoplastic process that may be affecting the eye. The biopsy would help to establish a tissue diagnosis and guide further management. Observation (option B) may not provide a definitive diagnosis and may allow the condition to progress. Referral for cardiac biopsy (option C) may not be necessary at this time, as the patient's cardiac issues may not be related to the ocular findings. Oral corticosteroid therapy (option D) may be considered, but a biopsy is needed first to determine the underlying cause of the choroidal infiltrate.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressively worsening vision, binocular diplopia, and limited extraocular motility, along with the physical findings of bilateral proptosis, increased resistance to retropulsion, and chorioretinal folds, suggest a possible diagnosis of thyroid-related orbitopathy (TRO). TRO is an autoimmune condition that can cause inflammation and swelling in the orbits, leading to compression of the optic nerve and retinal veins, and resulting in vision loss. The presence of intraretinal hemorrhages in the right eye also supports this diagnosis.

A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the orbits would be the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient. The CT scan would help to confirm the diagnosis of TRO by evaluating the size and shape of the orbits, the thickness of the orbital walls, and the presence of any inflammatory changes or masses. Additionally, the CT scan would help to identify any other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a orbital tumor or aneurysm.

Performing an orbital biopsy (Option A) may be necessary later in the management of the patient, but it would not be the most appropriate next step. Obtaining a consultation from the retina service (Option C) may also be helpful, but it is not the most urgent step in the patient's management. Emergency canthotomy and cantholysis to decompress the orbits (Option D) may be necessary in severe cases of TRO, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as the patient's symptoms are not yet severe enough to warrant emergency surgical intervention.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's presentation of bilateral sequential proptosis with periorbital edema and limitation in extraocular movements, along with the absence of any inciting trauma or significant medical history, suggests a possible diagnosis of orbital inflammatory disease. The laboratory results, including mildly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and positive anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies, support this diagnosis. Orbitotomy with biopsy would be the appropriate next step to establish a definitive diagnosis and guide further management. Empirical corticosteroid treatment may be considered while awaiting the biopsy results, but a biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and ensure appropriate treatment. External beam radiotherapy and intravenous antibiotic therapy are not appropriate for this condition.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with retinal exudates and hemorrhages, which can be caused by various conditions, including diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, and retinal vein occlusion. However, the patient's history of breast cancer and tamoxifen use suggests a possible diagnosis of radiation retinopathy. Radiation retinopathy is a known side effect of radiation therapy to the breast, and it can cause retinal exudates, hemorrhages, and macular edema. The patient's mild cataracts and cystoid cavitary abnormalities also support this diagnosis.

Therefore, the best course of action would be to recommend intravitreal anti-VEGF injection, which is a common treatment for radiation retinopathy. This treatment can help to reduce the edema and prevent further vision loss. Close observation and follow-up are also important to monitor the progression of the disease and adjust the treatment plan as needed.

Recommending continued blood glucose control and considering intravitreal anti-VEGF injection or focal laser treatment if the macular edema persists (option B) may be appropriate for diabetic retinopathy, but it may not be effective for radiation retinopathy. Explaining to the patient that these changes are medication-associated and recommending close observation (option C) may be appropriate for some cases, but it does not address the underlying cause of the problem. Referring the patient to the primary care physician for stricter blood pressure control (option D) may be appropriate for hypertensive retinopathy, but it is not relevant to this case.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of fluctuating left eye swelling and redness, along with the physical findings of a large subconjunctival hemorrhage and engorged episcleral veins, suggest a possible orbital vascular malformation. The presence of left eye abduction deficit and binocular horizontal diplopia also support this diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits would be the most appropriate next step to evaluate the possibility of an orbital vascular malformation, such as a cavernous sinus thrombosis or an orbital varix. This would help guide further management and potential referral to neurosurgery if necessary. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of blurred vision and floaters, along with the physical examination findings of vitritis and no obvious vascular sheathing or chorioretinal lesions, suggest a possible diagnosis of uveitis. Uveitis is a type of inflammation that affects the uvea, the middle layer of the eye, and can cause blurred vision, floaters, and eye pain. The absence of any retinal lesions or vascular abnormalities on optical coherence tomography and fluorescein angiography supports this diagnosis.

Given the patient's history of refractive surgery and well-controlled HIV, it is unlikely that the uveitis is caused by a systemic infection or inflammatory condition. Instead, it is more likely that the uveitis is caused by an inflammatory response within the eye itself, possibly related to the refractive surgery.

Therefore, the next step would be to perform a head/maxillofacial computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to rule out any underlying systemic causes of the uveitis, such as a sinusitis or a mastoiditis. This would help to guide further management and treatment of the patient's condition.

Starting topical or systemic steroids (option B) may be considered, but it would be premature to do so without first ruling out any underlying systemic causes of the uveitis. Performing a vitreous biopsy (option D) may also be considered, but it would be more appropriate to perform this procedure after the results of the CT or MRI are known. Observing the patient (option A) without further evaluation and management may not be the best approach, as the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a potentially treatable condition.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as the development of ulcers on his buccal mucosa and penile ulcer, as well as the hyperpigmented papules and plaques on his feet, are consistent with a lichenoid drug reaction. The fact that the patient had recently started pembrolizumab monotherapy for his cancer, and that the eruptions occurred four months after starting treatment, supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of HIV and previous treatment for syphilis increases the likelihood of a drug reaction. Lichen planus (option B) is a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's history of cancer and recent initiation of pembrolizumab. Secondary syphilis (option A) is unlikely given the patient's previous treatment for syphilis and the absence of other symptoms such as fever, chills, and weight loss. Janeway lesions secondary to endocarditis (option D) is also unlikely given the absence of other symptoms such as fever, chills, and weight loss, as well as the lack of evidence of endocarditis on physical examination.

Answer: D: Transthoracic echocardiogram with a bubble study.
Explanation: The patient's history of atrial fibrillation, atrial septal defect (ASD), and ventricular septal defect (VSD) repair suggests a higher risk of infective endocarditis, which can lead to brain abscesses. Transthoracic echocardiogram with a bubble study can help diagnose infective endocarditis by identifying vegetations on the heart valves or walls, which would guide antibiotic treatment. Transesophageal echocardiogram (A) may also be useful, but transthoracic echocardiogram is the initial step in evaluating cardiac disease. Computed tomographic imaging of the chest (B) may show lung lesions or pleural effusions, but it is not the most appropriate test for diagnosing infective endocarditis. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (C) is not typically used in the acute setting to diagnose infective endocarditis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of nasal congestion and epistaxis, along with the imaging findings of a soft-tissue mass extending from the nasopharynx into the left sphenoid sinus with erosion of the sphenoid sinus floor and the clivus, are consistent with an ectopic pituitary adenoma. The involvement of the clivus and the absence of a sellar or suprasellar mass also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of chronic hepatitis C and alcoholism increases the likelihood of this diagnosis, as ectopic pituitary adenomas are more common in patients with these conditions.

Squamous cell carcinoma (option A) is unlikely given the patient's history and the imaging findings, as it would typically present with a more aggressive clinical course and would be more likely to involve the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. Lymphoma (option B) is also unlikely, as the patient's symptoms and imaging findings do not suggest a lymphoproliferative disorder. Granulomatous disease (option D) is unlikely, as the patient's symptoms and imaging findings do not suggest a chronic inflammatory process.

The imaging studies, including CT and MRI, support this diagnosis and demonstrate an enhancing lesion lateral to the geniculate ganglion. The patient's history of progressive hearing loss and persistent ear fullness, as well as the extension of the mass into the eustachian tube, suggest that the mass is likely obstructing the middle ear and causing the symptoms. The histopathologic findings of predominantly spindled stroma with a focus of tumor that is positive for antiepithelial membrane antigen and somatostatin receptor 2A support the diagnosis of a primary middle ear meningioma. Therefore, option C, Primary middle ear meningioma, is the correct answer.

Answer: A
Explanation: A dermoid cyst, also known as a mature teratoma, is a benign growth that originates from pluripotent cells and can differentiate into various tissue types, including skin, hair follicles, and sweat glands. The patient's symptoms of nasal obstruction and difficulty breathing, along with the physical examination findings of a firm, pedunculated polypoid mass in the anterior nasal cavity, are consistent with a dermoid cyst. The absence of fluid in the mass and the negative Furstenberg sign also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's left eye ptosis and left preauricular branchial remnants suggest a possible association with a congenital anomaly, which is consistent with the diagnosis of a dermoid cyst.

The other options are less likely:

B: Hairy polyp is a rare benign tumor that originates from the nasal cavity and is usually pedunculated. However, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest a polyp.

C: Glioma is a malignant tumor that originates from the supportive tissue of the nervous system. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest a glioma, and the MRI findings do not show any evidence of intracranial tract.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as the rapid development of malignant tumors on sun-exposed skin, scaly skin, and intellectual normality, are consistent with Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP). XP is a rare genetic disorder caused by a defect in the DNA repair mechanism, leading to extreme sensitivity to UV radiation and a high risk of developing skin cancer. The patient's family history, with consanguineous parents and no similar cutaneous presentation in other relatives, also supports this diagnosis. Trichothiodystrophy (A) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by short stature, intellectual disability, and skin changes, but it does not explain the patient's rapid development of malignant tumors. Cockayne syndrome (B) is also a rare genetic disorder that can present with skin changes and intellectual disability, but it is not typically associated with malignant tumors.

Answer: D: Order testing for anticyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibody.
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of polyarthritis, particularly the involvement of the MCP and PIP joints, and the presence of a malar rash, suggest the possibility of an autoimmune disorder such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The positive ANA result supports this suspicion. Although the patient does not have a history of smoking, which is a known risk factor for RA, the presence of a malar rash increases the likelihood of an underlying autoimmune disorder. The absence of a rash on the trunk and extremities, as well as the absence of fever, differentiates this condition from other possible causes of polyarthritis such as infection or inflammatory conditions.

The patient's family history, with multiple members experiencing recent febrile illnesses with rashes, suggests a possible viral etiology. Parvovirus B19, which is known to cause Fifth disease, can also cause polyarthritis in adults, particularly in women. However, the absence of a rash on the trunk and extremities and the lack of fever in the patient make a viral etiology less likely.

Therefore, given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, it would be appropriate to order testing for anticyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibody, which is commonly used in the diagnosis of RA. If the CCP antibody test is positive, it would support the diagnosis of RA and guide further management.

It is not necessary to check for anti–double-stranded DNA and anti-Smith antibodies at this time, as they are not specific to RA and may not provide useful diagnostic information. Bilateral hand radiographs may be considered later in the evaluation process to assess for joint damage, but they are not necessary at this initial stage. Serologic testing for parvovirus may be considered, but given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results, it is less likely to be the underlying cause.

Answer: B 
Explanation: The patient's history of refractory leukemia and recent transformation to AML, along with the symptoms of severe protein-calorie malnutrition, pancytopenia, and recurrent neutropenic fevers, suggest that the patient has a compromised immune system. The palatal swelling and ulceration described in the case, along with the patient's history of poor oral hygiene, are consistent with a diagnosis of mucormycosis, a fungal infection that commonly affects immunocompromised patients. The patient's recent treatment with dexamethasone and nystatin also supports this diagnosis, as these medications are commonly used to treat fungal infections. The patient's retained tissue fragment, which was submitted for histologic evaluation, and the maxillofacial CT scan, which showed tissue enlargement in the left hard palate and maxillary sinus, also support the diagnosis of mucormycosis. Squamous cell carcinoma (option A) is a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's age and medical history. Aspergillosis (option C) is another possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's recent treatment with dexamethasone, which is effective against Aspergillus infections. Myeloid sarcoma (option D) is a rare complication of AML and is characterized by the infiltration of immature myeloid cells into various organs, but it is not typically associated with palatal swelling and ulceration. Therefore, option B, mucormycosis, is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The clinical presentation of multiple, asymptomatic, scattered white macules on the lower abdomen and pubic area, which were present at birth and had gradually increased in size and number, along with the absence of any systemic disorder or family history of similar lesions, suggests the diagnosis of clear cell papulosis. The histopathological findings of mild hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and scattered clear cells in the epidermis, with the clear cells being larger than the neighboring keratinocytes and containing abundant pale cytoplasm, also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the absence of accentuation with Wood light examination and the lack of hyphae on direct microscopic examination of scales soaked in potassium hydroxide, rules out the possibility of tinea versicolor. The presence of well-demarcated hypopigmented macules on the lower abdomen, also makes vitiligo less likely. Idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis is a diagnosis of exclusion and can be considered in the absence of any other identifiable cause, but given the presence of clear cells on histopathology, clear cell papulosis is a more likely diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as the necrotic plaque on the nose, crateriform nodules on the extremities, and multifocal pneumonia, are consistent with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener granulomatosis). The fact that the patient had a recent history of a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection of his nose and was treated with antibiotics without improvement also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the presence of bilateral pulmonary nodules and a soft-tissue mass that encases the nasal bone and extends into the right maxillary sinus and left nasal cavity, as shown by head computed tomography, are also consistent with granulomatosis with polyangiitis. The patient's age and the presence of poxlike scarring on the extremities also fit the demographic and clinical profile of patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis.

Therefore, option C, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener granulomatosis), is the most likely diagnosis for this patient's symptoms.

The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and medical history as well. Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (option A), typically presents with nasal cavity masses and does not have the same skin manifestations as the patient. Lymphomatoid granulomatosis (option B) is a rare condition that can present with skin nodules and lung involvement, but it typically has a more aggressive course and does not have the same nasal involvement as the patient. Histoplasmosis (option D) is a fungal infection that can cause skin lesions and lung nodules, but it does not have the same necrotic plaque on the nose or crateriform nodules on the extremities as the patient.

The patient's history of previous laparotomy and lysis of small adhesive bands supports this diagnosis. The positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold test result suggests that the patient has been exposed to tuberculosis, which could potentially complicate the patient's management, but it is not the most likely diagnosis given the patient's symptoms and imaging findings. Sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis and peritoneal carcinomatosis are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and clinical findings, including blurred vision, blocked vision, and retinal pigment epithelial changes, are consistent with sclerochoroidal calcifications. These calcifications are typically associated with hyperparathyroidism, which is a condition characterized by an overproduction of parathyroid hormone. Therefore, it would be appropriate to check the patient's parathyroid hormone, vitamin D, and calcium levels to determine if hyperparathyroidism is the underlying cause of the calcifications.

Option A, performing transvitreous biopsy, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis, but it is not the most appropriate next step. Biopsy carries risks, and it is not necessary to perform a biopsy when the clinical findings and imaging studies are consistent with sclerochoroidal calcifications.

Option B, beginning oral corticosteroid therapy, is not appropriate because corticosteroids are not effective in treating sclerochoroidal calcifications.

Answer: B
Explanation: A lumbar puncture would be performed to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for further evaluation, as the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest the possibility of an inflammatory or infectious condition affecting the central nervous system (CNS). The patient's history of hypertension and the presence of optic disc edema raise the suspicion of a potential CNS vasculitis, such as giant cell arteritis (GCA), which can cause optic disc edema and vision loss if left untreated. The presence of a relative afferent pupillary defect and superior greater than inferior peripheral field loss in the right eye also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the trace enhancement at the orbital apex seen on the T1-weighted MRI scan suggests inflammation in the orbit, which further supports the possibility of GCA. A lumbar puncture would allow for the analysis of the CSF for inflammatory markers, such as elevated white blood cell count and protein, and the detection of any infectious agents, such as bacteria or viruses, that may be causing the patient's symptoms.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and findings are consistent with central serous chorioretinopathy (CSR), a condition characterized by recurrent fluid accumulation in the subretinal space. The patient's history of painless blurry vision in the left eye for 1 week, followed by improvement in visual acuity after 3 weeks of observation, and then acute worsening of visual acuity to 20/200 OU with bilateral subretinal fluid, are all consistent with CSR. The late-phase fluorescein angiography findings of multifocal pinpoint areas of hyperfluorescence with mild leakage also support this diagnosis.

It is important to rule out other potential causes of subretinal fluid, such as syphilis, tuberculosis, and sarcoidosis, before starting treatment with oral corticosteroids. Ordering tests for these conditions (option A) is the next appropriate step. If the results are negative, starting treatment with oral corticosteroids (option A) may help to reduce inflammation and prevent further fluid accumulation.

Option B, ordering a complete blood cell count, may also be useful in evaluating the patient's overall health and potential inflammatory response, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case.

Answer: B 
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as a rapidly enlarging scalp lesion, itchiness, weight loss, and history of vague abdominal pain, are consistent with follicular lymphoma. The patient's history of declining further workup after minimal abdominal adenopathy was found also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the biopsy specimen shown in Figure 1B displays a follicular lymphoma. Therefore, option B is the correct answer. 
Mycosis fungoides (option A) is a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that typically presents with skin lesions, but it is not typically associated with the symptoms described in the patient's history. Lichen planus (option C) is a skin condition that can cause itching and lesions, but it is not typically associated with weight loss or abdominal pain. Marginal zone lymphoma (option D) is a type of B-cell lymphoma that can cause lymphadenopathy, but it is not typically associated with the patient's symptoms or biopsy results.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient presents with inferior ST-segment elevation, which suggests a possible occlusion of the inferior coronary arteries. The patient's history of remote percutaneous coronary intervention 19 years ago and the presence of bibasilar rales on physical examination suggest that the patient may have chronic coronary artery disease. Given the patient's hemodynamic instability and the presence of ST-segment elevation, it is likely that the patient is experiencing an acute coronary event. Performing coronary intervention with stenting of the left anterior descending artery is the most appropriate next step in management, as it has the potential to immediately improve blood flow to the affected myocardial area and reduce the risk of further cardiac damage. Measuring fractional flow reserve (Option B) may be useful in determining the severity of the plaque, but it would not address the acute coronary event. Pursuing the culprit coronary artery (Option C) without first addressing the acute coronary event may lead to further cardiac damage. Ordering urgent computed tomography angiography (Option D) may be useful in evaluating the coronary arteries, but it would not be the most appropriate next step in management given the patient's acute coronary event.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's elevated α-fetoprotein (AFP) level and liver masses suggest a possible diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A fludeoxyglucose F 18 (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) scan would be the next appropriate step to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of disease. The PET scan can help identify any metastatic lesions and guide further management. Sorafenib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, may also be considered for HCC, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. Beginning FOLFIRINOX chemotherapy without further diagnostic workup may not be the most effective treatment approach. Endoscopic ultrasound of the pancreas with fine-needle aspiration may be considered if the pancreatic tail mass is thought to be related to the patient's symptoms, but it is not the most pressing concern given the patient's elevated AFP level and liver masses.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of wheezing and dyspnea, along with the physical examination findings of biphasic stridor and normal vocal cord mobility, suggest an upper airway obstruction. The CT and MRI scans show a mass protruding into the trachea, which is consistent with a benign thyroid rest. The patient's history of dyspnea on mild exertion and the absence of any suspicious adenopathy also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's serum calcitonin level is normal, which suggests that the mass is not a medullary thyroid cancer. Therefore, option C, benign thyroid rest, is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of nasal congestion, headaches, and vision loss, along with the physical examination findings of afferent pupillary defect and cranial sixth-nerve palsy, suggest a sinonasal process that is affecting the orbit and potentially the brain. The laboratory results of an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level, along with the abnormal soft tissue seen on imaging, support an inflammatory or infectious process. The negative results for fungal elements on frozen sections and the presence of giant cells, necrosis, and inflammatory cells invading vessel walls on the final pathology slide are consistent with a diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). GPA is a systemic vasculitis that can affect the sinonasal tract and has been associated with orbital inflammation and vision loss. The other options, lymphoma, acute invasive fungal sinusitis, and sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma, can also present with similar symptoms and imaging findings, but are less likely given the patient's history and laboratory results.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and imaging findings are consistent with granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegner granulomatosis) and relapsing polychondritis. The patient's nasal swelling and tenderness, difficulty swallowing, headache, and nasal drainage are all symptoms of granulomatosis with polyangiitis. The imaging findings of marked soft tissue swelling and fullness with abnormal enhancement along the nasal cavity, including bilateral nasal ala, with areas of necrosis and emphysema, are also consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of progressive symptoms over 6 weeks and the absence of significant bony erosion or associated calcification on bone windows suggest a diagnosis of granulomatosis with polyangiitis. Relapsing polychondritis is a possible additional diagnosis, as it is often associated with granulomatosis with polyangiitis.

The other options are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and imaging findings. Extranodal T-cell lymphoma is a possibility, but the patient's symptoms and imaging findings are not typical of this diagnosis. Squamous cell carcinoma is unlikely given the patient's age and the absence of significant nasal lesions. Necrotizing fasciitis is also unlikely, as the patient does not have signs of severe infection or tissue necrosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: Osteosarcoma is a malignant bone tumor that can arise in the soft tissue of the neck, as opposed to osteochondroma (A), which is a benign bony outgrowth that typically arises from the bone cortex. Osteoid osteoma (B) is a benign tumor that consists of bone and cartilage and is usually less than 2 cm in size. Myositis ossificans (D) is a condition where muscle tissue is replaced by bone, but it does not typically present as a mass in the neck. The patient's history of a motor vehicle accident and the presence of dense acoustic shadowing on ultrasound suggest that the mass may be related to trauma, which would support the diagnosis of osteosarcoma. Additionally, the well-circumscribed nature of the mass and its separation from the underlying bone, as seen on CT imaging, are also consistent with osteosarcoma.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including fever, rash, and abnormal liver function test results, suggest a possible diagnosis of viral hepatitis. HIV infection can cause viral hepatitis, so it is appropriate to obtain an HIV immunoassay to rule out this possibility. Administering an intravenous steroid (option A) would not be appropriate for this patient, as there is no indication of an inflammatory or autoimmune disorder. Performing a liver biopsy (option C) may be necessary later on in the patient's care, but it is not the most appropriate next step. Initiating negative-pressure isolation (option D) is not necessary at this time, as there is no indication of a highly contagious illness or risk of transmission to others.

Answer: C 
Explanation: The patient's laboratory results show a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT) with anti-IgG and anti-C3, which suggests the presence of an autoantibody that is causing hemolysis. The patient's red blood cell count is also low, which is consistent with hemolytic anemia. The patient's lack of symptoms such as cough, chest pain, and leg swelling, as well as the absence of lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and ecchymosis, make it less likely that the anemia is caused by cold agglutinin disease (A) or pure red cell aplasia (B). Richter transformation (C) is a complication of chronic lymphocytic leukemia that can cause hemolytic anemia, but it is less likely in this case given the patient's lack of symptoms and the absence of lymphadenopathy. Warm autoimmune hemolytic anemia (D) is also a possibility, but the patient's lack of symptoms and the positive DAT suggest that the anemia is more likely caused by an autoantibody. Therefore, the correct answer is C: The patient has undergone Richter transformation.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient presents with chest pain and ECG changes consistent with non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). The patient has a history of asthma and recent cesarean section, which increases the risk of bleeding complications. Given the patient's clinical presentation and medical history, it is appropriate to start aspirin and ticagrelor, heparin infusion, and metoprolol tartrate as medical therapy for NSTEMI. Coronary angiography is also appropriate to evaluate the coronary arteries and determine the extent of the disease. However, thrombolytic therapy is not indicated in this case as the patient does not have ST segment elevation on ECG and the risk of bleeding complications is higher. Referral for CABG surgery is not necessary at this time as medical therapy and coronary angiography are appropriate first steps in managing the patient's condition. Performing PCI is also not appropriate as the patient does not have any significant coronary stenosis or occlusion that would require intervention. Therefore, the best answer is B: Continue medical therapy alone, with a β-blocker and antiplatelet therapy.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's acute kidney injury is most likely related to sepsis, as evidenced by the bilateral lung consolidations consistent with pneumonia, acute respiratory failure, and the need for mechanical ventilation. Sepsis can cause acute kidney injury by inducing inflammation and microvascular dysfunction in the kidneys. The patient's history of hypertension and the use of an angiotensin receptor blocker may also contribute to the development of acute kidney injury. The patient's urine output of 50 mL over 3 hours suggests that the patient may have had some degree of fluid overload, which can also contribute to acute kidney injury. The fact that the patient received 4.5 L of Ringer lactate over 12 hours may have helped to maintain fluid balance but does not necessarily address the underlying cause of the acute kidney injury. The change in serum creatinine within the coefficient of variation (Option A) does not necessarily rule out acute kidney injury, as the patient's baseline creatinine level may have been elevated due to chronic kidney disease. There are insufficient data to conclude that a decrease in glomerular filtration rate has occurred (Option D), as there is no information provided about the patient's baseline glomerular filtration rate or any changes in it over time. Prerenal azotemia (Option C) is less likely, as the patient's urine output and fluid balance suggest that there is not a significant degree of dehydration or hypovolemia.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's history of severe pruritus, the appearance of well-circumscribed, violaceous, annular patches limited to the right axilla, and the absence of scale or erosion are consistent with a diagnosis of fixed drug eruption. The patient's history of using over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream and ketoconazole cream, as well as the negative Wood lamp examination, suggest that the lesions are not due to a fungal infection. The patient's lack of systemic symptoms and the absence of other skin lesions also argue against a diagnosis of familial benign pemphigus (Hailey-Hailey disease) or inverse lichen planus. Erythrasma is a possibility, but the patient's history of severe pruritus and the absence of scale or erosion make fixed drug eruption a more likely diagnosis. The histopathologic findings of lymphocytes obscuring the dermal-epidermal junction, as seen in the punch biopsy specimen, are also consistent with fixed drug eruption.

Explanation: The patient's history of oral lichen planus (OLP) and the clinical appearance of a nonremovable white patch on the tongue are consistent with the diagnosis of oral lichen planus. The histopathological findings of hyperkeratotic, acanthotic stratified squamous epithelium with cells having lightly stained cytoplasm (balloon cells) throughout the stratum spinosum and superficial layer, as well as several epithelial nuclei with peripheral chromatin margination (chromatin beading), are also characteristic of OLP. The patient's history of mycosis fungoides/cutaneous T-cell lymphoma and use of immunosuppressive medications may also suggest an increased risk of developing OLP. Therefore, option B (Oral lichen planus) is the most appropriate diagnosis.

Explanation: Subungual melanoma is a type of skin cancer that affects the nail bed and is often characterized by a dark brown or black pigmented band extending from the nail plate to the proximal nail fold, which is consistent with the clinical presentation in this case. The patient's age and lack of other skin or nail lesions also support this diagnosis. Pigmented onychomatricoma (option A) is a benign tumor that typically appears as a single, well-defined, dark brown or black spot on the nail plate, whereas pigmented squamous cell carcinoma in situ (option C) usually presents as a painless, slowly growing, pigmented patch on the nail bed. Pigmented onychopapilloma (option D) is a rare benign tumor that typically appears as a small, dark brown or black spot on the nail plate. The patient's symptoms and clinical presentation do not fit with any of these alternative diagnoses. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is subungual melanoma.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive worsening of gait difficulties, loss of balance, saccadic pursuit, subtle appendicular ataxia, and spastic gait with a wide base are consistent with Friedreich ataxia. The increased visibility of retinal nerve fibers hiding the contours of retinal vessels bilaterally, and the markedly thickened retinal nerve fiber layer observed on OCT, are also consistent with Friedreich ataxia. This is a rare genetic disorder caused by an expansion of a GAA repeat in the frataxin gene, leading to progressive degeneration of the nervous system, particularly the cerebellum and spinal cord. The patient's family history, with no consanguinity and an unremarkable family history, also supports this diagnosis. Therefore, option B, Friedreich ataxia, is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C. Superior lumbar hernia (Grynfeltt-Lesshaft hernia).
Explanation: A superior lumbar hernia, also known as a Grynfeltt-Lesshaft hernia, occurs when a portion of the intestine or other tissue protrudes through a weakened area in the abdominal wall in the upper lumbar region. The patient's symptoms of a slowly enlarging bulge in the left midback, which is accentuated by coughing and upright posture, are consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the absence of pain directly overlying the area and the presence of a soft bulge in the lateral left midback support this diagnosis.

The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings as well. Option A, left lateral lumbar lipoma, is a benign fatty tumor that would not explain the patient's symptoms of a slowly enlarging bulge or the absence of pain directly overlying the area. Option B, posterior lateral muscular atrophy with pseudohernia, is a condition characterized by muscle wasting and a pseudohernia, but it would not explain the patient's symptoms of a bulge in the left midback. Option D, postoperative infected seroma, is a complication that can occur after surgery, but it would not explain the patient's symptoms of a slowly enlarging bulge or the absence of pain directly overlying the area.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and findings are consistent with a diagnosis of posterior scleritis, a rare inflammatory condition that affects the posterior segment of the eye. The presence of anterior chamber cell and flare, nongranulomatous keratic precipitates, and vitritis are all consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the peripheral retinal whitening with scalloped margins and intraretinal hemorrhages are consistent with a peripheral retinal vasculitis, which is often seen in association with posterior scleritis.

Given the patient's symptoms and findings, it is important to consider the potential underlying cause of the posterior scleritis. One possible cause is a hypercoagulable state, which can lead to the formation of blood clots in the retinal vessels and cause the symptoms and findings seen in this patient. Therefore, it is appropriate to order a hypercoagulable workup and start a regimen of aspirin, 325 mg daily, as option B suggests.

Option A, injecting an antivascular endothelial growth factor agent, may be considered for the treatment of retinal neovascularization, but it is not directly related to the patient's current symptoms and findings. Option C, obtaining an aqueous fluid sample for polymerase chain reaction and treating with antiviral agents, may be appropriate for diagnosing and treating a viral infection, but there is no indication of a viral etiology in this patient's presentation. Option D, obtaining a vitreous sample for culture and injecting vancomycin and ceftazidime, may be appropriate for diagnosing and treating bacterial endophthalmitis, but there is no indication of bacterial infection in this patient's presentation.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient has a history of recurrent bilateral periorbital swelling, which suggests a chronic inflammatory condition. The yellow lesions on both eyelids and the palpebral swelling greater in the left than the right eye suggest a possible diagnosis of xanthelasma. However, the patient's history of adult-onset asthma and the presence of a mass in the left superolateral orbit suggest a possible alternative diagnosis of IgG4-related disease. IgG4-related disease is a systemic condition characterized by inflammation and fibrosis, which can affect various organs, including the lacrimal gland and orbit. The patient's symptoms and findings are consistent with this diagnosis, and therefore, it is appropriate to consider a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. Oral corticosteroid treatment may be effective in reducing inflammation, but surgical debulking may not be necessary at this stage. Corticosteroid-sparing immunosuppressive therapy may also be considered if the patient has a severe disease.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of eye pain, blurred vision, and photophobia, along with the physical examination findings of anterior chamber pigment and flare, iris irregularities, and mild intraocular pressure asymmetry, suggest a diagnosis of reverse pupillary block. This is supported by the observation of posterior concavity of the iris and iris-lens touch on gonioscopy, and the absence of any other ocular abnormalities. The patient's history of recent laser eyebrow epilation with an 800-nm diode laser, which was not shielded properly during the procedure, suggests that the laser energy may have entered the eye and caused the reverse pupillary block.

Therefore, the appropriate next step would be to further taper her corticosteroid dosage and start a cycloplegic agent to break posterior synechiae, as option B states. This will help to relieve the patient's symptoms and prevent further complications.

Option A, increasing her topical corticosteroid dosage, may provide some relief for the patient's symptoms, but it will not address the underlying cause of the reverse pupillary block.

Option C, performing AC paracentesis and sending fluid for viral polymerase chain reaction analysis, is not indicated in this case, as there is no evidence of an infectious etiology for the patient's symptoms.

Option D, performing urgent peripheral iridotomy given IOP asymmetry, is also not indicated, as the patient's IOP asymmetry is mild and there is no evidence of angle closure glaucoma.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of acute-onset blurry vision and pain in the left eye, along with the physical examination findings of diminished visual acuity, relative afferent pupillary defect, and corneal microcystic edema, suggest a possible increase in intracranial pressure (ICP). The presence of stable grade 2 optic disc edema and enlarged blind spot on visual field testing also support this diagnosis. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with venography would be the appropriate next step to evaluate for possible causes of increased ICP, such as a tumor or cerebral edema. Performing gonioscopy (B) or instilling a miotic agent (C) would not be appropriate at this time, as they are not directly related to the patient's symptoms or suspected diagnosis.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, including facial plethora, retinal hemorrhages, and dilated retinal veins, suggest the possibility of a systemic condition that may be affecting the retinal circulation. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen can help identify potential causes such as a renal or hepatic disorder, which may be related to the patient's history of hypertension and atrial fibrillation. Additionally, the presence of bruising on the right shoulder without any history of trauma suggests the possibility of a bleeding disorder, which could also be investigated with a CT scan. Performing ocular massage (B) may be unnecessary and not directly related to the patient's symptoms. Obtaining a complete blood cell count (C) may be useful in evaluating the patient's overall health and identifying potential blood-related disorders, but it may not specifically address the retinal findings.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with Atypical White Dot Syndrome (AWDS), a rare inflammatory retinal disease. The presence of subretinal deposits, choroidal thickening, and irregularity of the retinal pigment epithelium on optical coherence tomography (OCT) support this diagnosis. The patient's history of remote cataract extraction and absence of any other ocular disease suggest that the AWDS is not related to a previous intraocular surgery or any other known ocular condition. Given the patient's age and medical history, it is likely that the AWDS is associated with an underlying systemic inflammatory disorder. The patient's negative review of symptoms and absence of any other systemic signs of inflammation suggest that the inflammation is likely controlled with the current medications. However, to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of AWDS, HLA-A29 laboratory analysis should be performed before initiating treatment with systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppression. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Initiation of treatment with systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppression after HLA-A29 laboratory analysis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, laboratory results, and imaging studies are consistent with a diagnosis of primary malignant mediastinal germ cell tumor. The patient's age and smoking history increase the likelihood of this diagnosis. The histopathological findings of a poorly differentiated malignant neoplasm with foci of abrupt squamous differentiation, including keratinization and intercellular bridges, are also consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the immunohistochemical staining results, which show tumor cells to be strongly and diffusely positive for keratin AE1/AE3, cytokeratin 5/6, and p63, support this diagnosis. The absence of S-100, melan A, placental alkaline phosphatase, CD56, thyroid transcription factor-1, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, CD45, and cytokeratin 7 staining also helps to rule out other potential diagnoses. Therefore, option C, primary malignant mediastinal germ cell tumor, is the most likely diagnosis.

Explanation: The patient's history of smoking and the presence of a nodular cystic-appearing lesion on the posterior inferior border of the right vocal process suggest a diagnosis of vocal fold granuloma. The absence of overlying ulceration and the preservation of the vocal fold mucosal wave in the adjacent membranous vocal fold also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the presence of submucosal white caseous debris in the substance of the lesion and the negative cultures for fungus, bacteria, and mycobacteria further support the diagnosis of vocal fold granuloma. Laryngeal tuberculosis (option A) is unlikely given the absence of symptoms and the negative cultures. Laryngeal gout (option B) is also unlikely given the absence of symptoms and the normal vocal fold mobility.

Explanation: Kimura disease is a rare, benign, chronic inflammatory condition that affects the lymph nodes and surrounding tissues. It is characterized by the presence of numerous eosinophils, histiocytes, and lymphocytes in the affected lymph nodes. The patient's symptoms of bilateral periauricular swelling that gradually progressed over 6 months, along with the presence of occasional pruritus and slight elevation of serum eosinophil count, are consistent with Kimura disease. The fact that the fine-needle aspiration cytology and incisional biopsy results were consistent with reactive lymphadenitis, and the patient did not respond to oral antibiotics, also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the imaging findings of bilateral multiple enhancing lymph nodes in the postauricular region and bilateral intraparotid nodes, are consistent with Kimura disease.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of odynophagia and the mass's location in the left oropharynx, as well as the presence of a pacemaker for sinus asystole due to mass effect on the carotid body, suggest a possible diagnosis of a parapharyngeal mass. The patient's history of Poland syndrome also supports this diagnosis, as it is a rare congenital disorder characterized by unilateral absence of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, which can be associated with other congenital anomalies.

The patient underwent multiple biopsies, which were inconclusive, and a transcervical resection with transoral partial glossectomy, palatectomy, and pharyngectomy with reconstruction was necessary to obtain a diagnosis. The immunohistochemical analysis of the removed tissue was positive for CD4 (weak), CD21, CD23, and vimentin with a low proliferation rate, which supports the diagnosis of a follicular dendritic cell sarcoma.

Therefore, the correct answer is option C: Follicular dendritic cell sarcoma.

The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and test results:

Option A, poorly undifferentiated carcinoma, does not match the patient's symptoms or the results of the immunohistochemical analysis.

Option B, ectopic thymoma, is unlikely given the location of the mass and the patient's history of Poland syndrome.

Option D, peripheral nerve sheath tumor, does not match the patient's symptoms or the results of the immunohistochemical analysis.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's history of pulmonary thromboendarterectomy for chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension and the presence of multiple lung nodules on the chest computed tomography scan suggest a high likelihood of pulmonary embolism. Right-sided endocarditis should be ruled out as it can cause similar symptoms and can be life-threatening if left untreated. Cardiac echocardiography is the appropriate diagnostic test to assess for right-sided endocarditis. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of hypoesthesia and hyperpigmentation on the palm, as well as the presence of perineural granulomas on biopsy, suggest the possibility of leprosy. A diagnostic biopsy of the hyperpigmented area and right ulnar nerve would be the next step to confirm the diagnosis.

Option A is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and biopsy results suggest a treatable condition, and further evaluation is needed to determine the appropriate treatment.

Option C is incorrect because while a 6-month course of isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide may be appropriate for treating leprosy, it is not the next step in the patient's management. A diagnostic biopsy should be performed first to confirm the diagnosis.

Option D is incorrect because while a 12-month course of dapsone combined with rifampin may be appropriate for treating leprosy, it is not the next step in the patient's management. A diagnostic biopsy should be performed first to confirm the diagnosis.

Explanation: The patient requires a liver biopsy to confirm fibrosis stage because the VCTE performed prior to treatment was negative for significant fibrosis at 6.7 kPa, but the laboratory studies and VCTE results shown in Table 1 indicate that the patient has elevated liver enzymes and a high hyaluronic acid level, which are indicative of fibrosis. Additionally, the patient's history of chronic hepatitis C genotype 1b and treatment with simeprevir and sofosbuvir suggest that the patient may have developed fibrosis over time. Therefore, a liver biopsy is necessary to confirm the fibrosis stage and determine the appropriate course of action.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's home BP measurements were often lower than 120/80 mm Hg but sometimes reached 200/100 mm Hg, indicating large fluctuations in BP. The 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring showed mean BP levels of 133/86 mm Hg overall, 135/88 mm Hg during the daytime, and 124/78 mm Hg during sleep, which are all above the normal ranges. These findings suggest that the patient has masked uncontrolled hypertension, which is defined as normal office BP but elevated BP outside of the office. The patient's history of a non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction and treatment with a drug-eluting stent also suggest that she is at high risk for cardiovascular disease, making it important to address her uncontrolled hypertension. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of well-marginated brown atrophic patches on the bilateral palms extending focally onto the volar aspect of the wrist and centrally surmounted by spiny keratotic pits in the palmar creases, as well as the histopathologic features of orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis, granular layer liquefaction, and dermal fibrosis, are consistent with acquired palmoplantar keratoderma (APK). APK is a chronic condition characterized by thickening and hardening of the skin on the palms and soles, often associated with inflammation and itching. The absence of involvement of the plantar surfaces and the presence of spiny keratotic pits in the palmar creases support the diagnosis of APK over other possibilities such as lichen sclerosus et atrophicus, acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans, and sclerotylosis (Huriez syndrome).

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's history of recurrent annular plaques on the trunk that spontaneously resolve by the beginning of autumn and the absence of lesions on the face, hands, or feet are consistent with erythema papulosa semicircularis recidivans (EPSR). EPSR is a rare, benign, and chronic condition characterized by recurrent, symmetrical, and usually bilateral erythematous plaques on the trunk and extremities. The lesions typically appear in the summer months and resolve in the fall, as seen in this case. The patient's lack of response to antihistamines and topical steroids also supports this diagnosis, as EPSR is known to be resistant to conventional treatments. The histopathological findings of a sparse perivascular inflammatory infiltrate and lymphocytes, as seen in the direct immunofluorescence, are also consistent with EPSR.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of bilateral vision and hearing loss, painful paresthesias in the feet, and length-dependent loss of vibratory sensation are consistent with Susac syndrome, a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the nervous system. The patient's history of well-controlled hypertension, lumbar stenosis, and hip arthroplasty with revisions suggests that the symptoms are not related to these conditions. The patient's laboratory results, including elevated thyrotropin and low levels of free thyroxine, are also consistent with Susac syndrome. The patient's treatment with high-dose steroids and plasmapheresis, which had no effect on his symptoms, further supports this diagnosis.

The other options are less likely:

A. Neuromyelitis optica (Devic disease) is a demyelinating disease that affects the optic nerves and spinal cord. While the patient's vision loss is consistent with this diagnosis, the absence of spinal cord symptoms and the presence of hearing loss and peripheral neuropathy make it less likely.

B. Amyloidosis is a condition in which abnormal proteins accumulate in tissues. While it can cause peripheral neuropathy and other symptoms, it is not typically associated with vision and hearing loss.

D. Cobalt toxicity is a potential complication of metal-on-metal hip arthroplasty, but it is not associated with the patient's symptoms of vision and hearing loss, peripheral neuropathy, or thyroid dysfunction. The patient's history of hip arthroplasty with revisions increases the likelihood of a diagnosis related to the implant, but cobalt toxicity is not the most likely explanation for the patient's symptoms.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of sudden-onset, constant, right lower quadrant abdominal pain associated with vomiting and melena, along with the absence of hematochezia or a history of peptic ulcer disease, suggest a possible diagnosis of diverticulitis with perforation. The patient's history of polycystic ovarian syndrome, diabetes, stroke, and coronary artery disease may also increase her risk for developing diverticulitis. The laboratory results, particularly the elevated leukocyte count, neutrophilia, and lipase concentration, support this diagnosis. The imaging findings of segmental mural thickening of the anterior cecum with wall hypoenhancement and pneumatosis, adjacent fat stranding, and a lucency medial to the cecum, are also consistent with diverticulitis. Therefore, option C, diverticulitis with perforation, is the most likely diagnosis.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of unilateral eyelid swelling, submandibular lymph node enlargement, dysphagia, fever, and chills, along with the history of hypothyroidism and the absence of conjunctival inflammatory signs, suggest a diagnosis of orbital lymphoma. Methotrexate sodium is a chemotherapy agent commonly used to treat lymphoma, and would be an appropriate next step in management. Oral corticosteroids (option A) may be used to reduce inflammation, but they would not be effective in treating the underlying lymphoma. External beam radiotherapy to the orbit (option C) may be considered for treatment of locally advanced disease, but it would not be the next step in management at this point.

Answer: D: Perform serologic testing for Bartonella henselae and Francisella tularensis.
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest the possibility of a bacterial or viral infection. The history of handling a bloody raccoon carcass without gloves increases the likelihood of an animal-borne infection. Bartonella henselae and Francisella tularensis are both known to cause conjunctivitis and can be transmitted through contact with contaminated animal fluids. Performing serologic testing for these pathogens can help confirm the diagnosis and guide appropriate treatment.

The other options do not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms:

A: Performing conjunctival cultures may help identify the specific pathogen causing the infection, but it does not address the potential source of the infection.

B: Repeated computed tomography of the orbits with contrast may help evaluate the extent of the infection, but it is not necessary at this point and may not provide any new information.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a retinal vascular disorder, and the presence of submacular hemorrhage and pigment epithelial detachment on dilated fundus examination suggests a possible diagnosis of retinal vasculitis or retinal vein occlusion. Indocyanine green angiography (ICG) is a diagnostic test that can help differentiate between these two conditions, as it can identify areas of leakage or non-perfusion in the retinal vasculature. Additionally, fluorescein angiography may also be performed to evaluate the retinal circulation and identify any areas of leakage or obstruction. Therefore, option B (Indocyanine green angiography, fluorescein angiography, or both) is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient.

Computed tomography of the brain (option A) may be considered to rule out any intracranial causes of sudden visual loss, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. B-scan ultrasonography (option C) is not necessary at this point, as the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest a retinal detachment or other structural abnormality. Autofluorescence (option D) is not a diagnostic test that is typically used in the evaluation of retinal vascular disorders.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of viral retinitis, specifically cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis. The presence of conjunctival hyperemia, keratic precipitates, cells in the anterior chamber, vitritis, intraretinal hemorrhages, and retinal whitening and thickening with subretinal fluid are all consistent with this diagnosis. The fluorescein angiography findings of late vascular leakage with both arterial and venous involvement and peripheral ischemia also support this diagnosis.

Given the suspected diagnosis of CMV retinitis, the appropriate next step would be to obtain an aqueous sample through needle aspirate for viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to confirm the diagnosis. This is answer B.

Initiating uveitis workup and starting topical corticosteroid therapy (answer A) may be appropriate for other types of uveitis, but it is not the most appropriate step for this patient given the suspected diagnosis of CMV retinitis.

Right heart catheterization would be the next step to evaluate the patient's pulmonary circulation and diagnose any potential pulmonary embolism. This would also help to determine the cause of the elevated mean tricuspid valve gradient seen on transthoracic echocardiography. Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (option B) may also be considered, but right heart catheterization is more invasive and would provide more definitive information.

Explanation: An oral sodium load test for hyperaldosteronism should be performed next because the patient's history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidemia, along with the presence of an adrenal mass, suggests the possibility of hyperaldosteronism. The patient's lack of symptoms such as headache, palpitations, fatigue, muscle weakness, or weight change, which are commonly associated with hypercortisolism, makes hyperaldosteronism a more likely diagnosis. Additionally, the round and homogenous appearance of the mass on CT scan and its CT attenuation of 24 HU, which is higher than the normal adrenal gland, suggests a possible aldosterone-producing adenoma. Therefore, it is appropriate to perform an oral sodium load test to confirm the diagnosis of hyperaldosteronism before proceeding with further evaluation or treatment.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of vulvar and buttock ulcers, tender to palpation, and leukopenia with a high differential of neutrophils, are consistent with cytomegalovirus (CMV) ulcers. CMV is a common cause of ulcers in the elderly, and the patient's recent hospitalization for pneumonia increases the likelihood of CMV infection. The hematoxylin-eosin stain (Figure 1C) shows characteristic features of CMV ulcers, including multinucleated giant cells and abundant viral inclusions. The patient's history of lower urinary tract symptoms and lack of sexual activity also support this diagnosis. Fixed drug eruption (answer A) is less likely given the absence of a clear medication trigger and the presence of ulcers on the buttocks. Cutaneous candidiasis (answer B) may cause vulvar lesions, but the presence of buttock ulcers and the patient's history of pneumonia make CMV infection more likely. Genital herpes simplex virus infection (answer D) may cause ulcers, but the patient's age and lack of sexual activity make this diagnosis less likely.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of persistent malar erythema with atrophy, as well as the presence of focal areas of atrophy on the cheeks and nasal bridge, are consistent with the diagnosis of neutrophilic sebaceous adenitis (NSA). NSA is a rare inflammatory skin disorder characterized by the infiltration of neutrophils into the sebaceous glands, leading to inflammation and destruction of the glands. The patient's history of treatment with various medications, including topical and oral antibiotics, without improvement, also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's development of a burning sensation in the affected areas is consistent with the pain and discomfort that can be associated with NSA. The negative results for anti-Ro, anti-La, and qualitative ANA antibodies, as well as the absence of other systemic symptoms, make a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) less likely. The patient's age and lack of significant medical history also make SLE less likely. Granuloma faciale is a rare condition characterized by the formation of granulomas in the skin, typically in response to a trigger such as a cutaneous infection. While the patient's history of treatment with topical and oral medications may suggest a possible infectious etiology, the absence of other signs of infection, such as swelling, redness, or purulent discharge, makes this diagnosis less likely. Rosacea-like dermatitis is a condition that can cause facial redness and inflammation, but it typically does not result in the formation of atrophic plaques or scarring, as seen in this patient.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and histopathological findings are consistent with annular erythema of infancy. Annular erythema of infancy is a rare condition characterized by recurrent, self-limiting, annular erythematous patches with central clearing and mild scaling. The condition typically affects children under the age of 5, and the lesions may appear on the trunk, limbs, and buttocks. The patient's history of an expanding erythematous eruption on the lower legs, abdomen, and buttocks, with waxing and waning episodes lasting for approximately 1 week, and the presence of faint, nonscaling annular serpiginous, erythematous plaques with central clearing and barely elevated borders, are all consistent with annular erythema of infancy. The histopathological findings of a perivascular and inflammatory infiltrate that includes eosinophils, as seen in Figure, B and C, are also consistent with this diagnosis.

The other options are less likely diagnoses for the patient's condition:

A. Tinea corporis (ringworm) is a fungal infection that can cause annular lesions, but the patient's lesions are not scaly or raised, and there is no evidence of fungal infection on histopathology.

B. Erythema marginatum is a condition characterized by red, marginated patches on the trunk and limbs, often associated with viral infections. The patient's lesions do not have the characteristic marginated appearance, and there is no evidence of a viral infection.

D. Erythema migrans (Lyme disease) is a condition caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, transmitted through the bite of an infected tick. The patient's lesions do not have the characteristic target or "bull's-eye" appearance of erythema migrans, and there is no evidence of tick exposure or infection.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of subacute progressive ptosis, ophthalmoplegia, gait instability, and cognitive changes, along with the negative results for acetylcholine receptor antibodies and the muscle-specific kinase antibody, are consistent with the diagnosis of Miller Fisher variant of Guillain-Barre syndrome. This is a rare variant of Guillain-Barre syndrome that is characterized by the presence of anti-GQ1b antibodies, which are not present in the patient's serum. The patient's cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed a mild pleocytosis, elevated protein, and normal glucose levels, which are consistent with the diagnosis of Miller Fisher variant of Guillain-Barre syndrome. The patient's brain MRI showing T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensities in the right thalamus, inferior temporal gyrus, and hippocampus also supports this diagnosis. Myasthenia gravis, Wernicke encephalopathy, and anti-Ma2 encephalitis can also present with similar symptoms, but the patient's negative test results for acetylcholine receptor antibodies and the muscle-specific kinase antibody, along with the absence of other characteristic findings, make these diagnoses less likely.

Explanation: The patient has already tried eyelid scrubs and artificial tears, which have not improved his symptoms. Given the patient's history of basal cell carcinoma and the presence of meibomian gland dysfunction, it is important to rule out the possibility of a malignant lesion. A shave biopsy or wedge biopsy would be invasive and may not provide a clear diagnosis. Clinical observation may not be sufficient to diagnose the lesion, and may lead to a delay in treatment if the lesion is indeed malignant. Therefore, the best course of action would be to epilate the misdirected lashes and return in 3 months to reassess the lesion and determine if further treatment is necessary.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with bilateral optic nerve swelling, which can be caused by various conditions, including infection, inflammation, and tumor. The patient's history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma increases the likelihood that the optic nerve swelling is caused by a tumor-related process. Diagnostic anterior chamber paracentesis with intravitreal injection of foscarnet sodium is a reasonable next step to evaluate the patient's condition, as it can help to confirm the diagnosis of ocular involvement by the lymphoma and guide further management. Intravitreal injection of amphotericin B (option A) may be considered in cases of suspected fungal infection, but it is not the most appropriate choice in this case given the patient's history of lymphoma and the absence of clinical signs of fungal infection. Diagnostic vitrectomy (option C) may be necessary if the diagnosis is still uncertain after anterior chamber paracentesis, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. Stereotactic radiation therapy to the optic nerve (option D) is not indicated in this case, as it is not a primary treatment for optic nerve swelling and may not be effective in managing the underlying cause of the condition.

Answer: A. Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits with and without contrast.
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of unilateral proptosis, hypoglobus, and restricted upgaze suggest a possible orbital mass or inflammatory condition. The CT scan did not show any evidence of a mass or enlarged extraocular muscles, but it did reveal mild fat compartment expansion. To further evaluate the possibility of an orbital inflammatory or infectious condition, an MRI of the orbits with and without contrast would be the next appropriate step. This would provide additional information on the soft tissues of the orbit, including any potential inflammation or masses that may not have been visible on the CT scan.

Serologic workup (B) may be necessary if an inflammatory or infectious condition is suspected, but it would not provide the same level of detail as an MRI in evaluating the orbit. Chest CT (C) would not be directly relevant to the patient's symptoms or findings.

Answer: B
Explanation: The shallowing of the anterior chamber observed immediately after the iridectomy suggests that there may be a leak in the chamber, which could be caused by the surgical procedure. Inflating the anterior chamber with an ophthalmic viscosurgical device would help to deepen the chamber and potentially identify any leaks or areas of weakness in the chamber that may need additional treatment. This would be a safer and more effective approach than applying fibrin glue to all surgical wounds (option A), injecting a sterile air bubble (option C), or tilting the microscope for better visualization of the anterior chamber (option D).

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of bilateral severe decreased vision, normal examination findings, and history of systemic lupus erythematosus and cystic fibrosis suggest a possible diagnosis of neuromyelitis optica (NMO). NMO is a rare autoimmune disease that affects the optic nerves and spinal cord. The patient's history of taking hydroxychloroquine, which is commonly used to treat lupus, may also suggest a possible diagnosis of NMO. Performing a lumbar puncture to test for infectious processes and ordering spinal cord imaging to evaluate for inflammation or demyelination in the spinal cord are both appropriate next steps in the patient's evaluation. Stopping the hydroxychloroquine without further evaluation may not be the most appropriate next step, as it may not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Ordering an electroretinogram and a multifocal electroretinogram may also be useful in evaluating the patient's visual function, but they are not as urgently needed as the lumbar puncture and spinal cord imaging. Therefore, the best answer is B, Perform a lumbar puncture because of suspicion of an infectious process.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's presentation of a slowly progressive, painless proptosis with a superonasal orbital mass on MRI that is T1 isointense to brain parenchyma and heterogeneously T2 hyperintense, with a small cystic component and avid peripheral contrast enhancement, suggests a possible diagnosis of a benign orbital tumor such as a meningothelial or lacrimal gland tumor. However, the radiologist's comment that the mass does not have the typical appearance of a vascular malformation or schwannoma and the suggestion to consider other neoplastic and chronic infectious causes, including a parasitic origin, indicates that the diagnosis is not yet certain. Given the patient's asymptomatic status and the lack of any obvious danger signs, it is reasonable to observe the patient with regular follow-up MRI scans to monitor for any changes in the mass. Therefore, option A, "Observe and perform another MRI in 6 months," is the most appropriate next step in management.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's history of a growing, painless mass in the right thigh, along with the imaging findings of a soft-tissue mass in the posterior recess of the ankle joint, and the positive EWS-FLI1 fusion gene, are consistent with a diagnosis of Ewing sarcoma. The high uptake of FDG on PET at the site of the subcutaneous tumor and at the second lesion in the left ankle joint also supports this diagnosis. The patient's report of vague pain around the left ankle and the absence of functional limitations or history of trauma at that site also suggest that the soft-tissue mass in the ankle is likely to be a metastasis rather than a primary tumor. Therefore, option C, Ewing sarcoma (soft-tissue metastasis), is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and echocardiography results suggest that he has developed bioprosthetic aortic stenosis, which is a known complication of transcatheter aortic valve replacement. The nodular filling defects along all of the leaflets with restricted excursion seen on 4-dimensional computed tomography angiography support this diagnosis. The patient's history of recurrent dyspnea following TAVR and the absence of other potential causes of dyspnea, such as coronary artery disease or heart failure, also support this diagnosis.

Given the patient's history of TAVR and the presence of bioprosthetic aortic stenosis, the best course of action would be to increase the aspirin dosage to 325 mg daily, discontinue clopidogrel, and administer ticagrelor. This combination of antiplatelet agents is commonly used to prevent stent thrombosis and has been shown to be effective in patients with TAVR. Unfractioned heparin and warfarin may also be considered, but they are not the most appropriate choice for this patient given the absence of atrial fibrillation or ventricular aneurysm. Blood culture samples and combination cefazolin, rifampin, and gentamicin may be appropriate for patients with infective endocarditis, but there is no evidence to suggest that this patient has an infection. Urgent valve replacement may be necessary if the patient's symptoms persist or worsen despite medical therapy, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this time.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's slow-growing fibrous parapharyngeal mass with a spindle cell neoplasm and abundant myxocollagenous matrix is consistent with a diagnosis of collagenous fibroma. This rare benign tumor typically affects the head and neck region and can infiltrate surrounding tissues, as seen in this case. The patient's history of smoking and unilateral conductive hearing loss also support this diagnosis. While desmoid-type fibromatosis (option A) and solitary fibrous tumor (option D) are also possibilities, the absence of radiographic evidence of osseous extension or destruction and the focal infiltration of subcutaneous fat and skeletal muscle suggest that collagenous fibroma is the most likely diagnosis. Neurofibroma (option B) is less likely given the absence of a neurological component in the tumor.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of heartburn and regurgitation while supine, despite taking omeprazole and making lifestyle changes, suggest that he has a motility disorder rather than just acid reflux. This is supported by the fact that EGD revealed normal esophageal mucosa and biopsies. An esophageal high-resolution manometry (HRM) study was performed, which showed abnormal results. Therefore, the next step would be to perform an esophageal (Heller) myotomy and partial fundoplication, which would help to improve the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) function and reduce symptoms.

Option A, performing 360-degree (Nissen) fundoplication, would not be appropriate as it is a more invasive procedure that is typically reserved for patients with severe GERD symptoms and evidence of esophageal damage.

Option C, increasing omeprazole dosing to twice daily, may provide some relief for the patient's symptoms, but it would not address the underlying motility disorder.

Option D, replacing omeprazole with nortriptyline, may also provide some relief for symptoms, but it would not address the underlying motility disorder and may have side effects.

The presence of polymorphic erythematous macules and plaques with elevated and indurated borders without evanescence to pressure, as well as the chronic dermic granulomatous process and perineural distribution of the infiltrate, are all consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of treatment with antihistamines and oral corticosteroids without improvement suggests that the condition is not likely to be urticarial vasculitis, which would have responded to these treatments. Mycosis fungoides and borderline-borderline leprosy are both unlikely given the absence of characteristic skin lesions and the patient's age. Sarcoidosis is also unlikely given the absence of typical skin lesions and the lack of involvement of other organs.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as linear hyperkeratotic papules on her right arm that are distributed in a Blaschkoid pattern and do not change with sun exposure or seasons, are consistent with Porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus. This condition is characterized by linear or streaky arrangements of small keratotic papules or plaques on the skin, often following the lines of Blaschko. Additionally, the presence of reddish punctate keratotic papules on the patient's right forearm that coalesce into plaques on the dorsum of her right hand supports this diagnosis. The lack of extracutaneous abnormalities also aligns with this diagnosis, as Porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus typically does not affect other parts of the body.

Answer: C
Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of proptosis, ptosis, and ophthalmoplegia of the left eye, along with the physical examination findings of periorbital swelling and diminished corneal reflex, are consistent with Orbital Apex Syndrome (OAS). This is a rare condition caused by inflammation or compression of the structures in the apex of the orbit, including the cranial nerves III, IV, and VI. The absence of any recent trauma, weight loss, or travel, and the normal results of visual acuity and visual field testing, support this diagnosis. Cavernous sinus syndrome (option B) is a possibility, but it is less likely given the absence of any symptoms or signs of cranial nerve VI palsy. Thyroid eye disease (option A) can also present with proptosis and ophthalmoplegia, but it typically affects both eyes and is associated with thyroid dysfunction, which is not mentioned in the case. Orbital cellulitis (option D) is an infection of the orbit, but it typically presents with pain, redness, and swelling of the eyelids, and is not associated with ophthalmoplegia.

Answer: B Atrioesophageal fistula 
Explanation: An atrioesophageal fistula is a rare complication that can occur after an atrial fibrillation ablation procedure. It is a communication between the atrium and the esophagus that can cause blood to flow from the atrium into the esophagus, leading to symptoms such as dysphagia, chest pain, and cerebral embolism. The patient's presentation of acute-onset aphasia, right-sided hemiplegia, and fever, along with the laboratory findings of elevated white blood cell count and the presence of Streptococcus mitis in the blood cultures, are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's recent history of a thoracoscopic ablative procedure and the presence of pneumocephalus on head computed tomography (CT) also support this diagnosis. The other options, cardioembolic stroke from atrial fibrillation, patent foramen ovale and paradoxical embolus, and bacterial endocarditis, can also cause neurologic abnormalities, but are less likely given the patient's history and presentation.

This is a condition where the spermatic cord becomes twisted, cutting off blood flow to the testicle, which can cause swelling and pain. The fact that the swelling is not reducible and the right testicle is not palpable also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's age and lack of significant medical history make it less likely that the swelling is caused by a hydrocele (A), primary testicular lymphoma (C), or scrotal cystocele (D).

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of worsening blurry vision on the right side, along with the physical examination findings of a right-sided homonymous hemianopia, suggest a possible diagnosis of a visual field defect caused by a cerebral vasospasm or ischemic event. Calcium channel blockers are commonly used to prevent migraine headaches, which can be associated with cerebral vasospasm. Therefore, option A, beginning treatment with calcium channel blockers for migraine prevention, is the most appropriate next step in management.

Option B, performing cerebral angiography, may be considered in some cases to evaluate the cerebral vasculature and identify any potential abnormalities, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, given the patient's symptoms and examination findings.

Option C, beginning treatment with tissue plasminogen activator, is not appropriate in this case, as it is used to treat acute ischemic stroke, and there is no evidence of an acute stroke in this patient's presentation.

Option D, observation, may be considered in some cases, but given the patient's symptoms and examination findings, it is not the most appropriate next step in management.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a retinal lesion. The most appropriate next step would be to follow up in 12 months to reexamine the lesion and assess any changes. This will help to determine if the lesion is stable or if it has grown or changed in any way. Additionally, it is important to monitor the patient's vision and check for any potential complications.

Intravenous fluorescein angiography (Option A) may be useful in evaluating the lesion, but it is not necessary at this time. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain (Option B) is not indicated as the lesion is located in the retina and there are no signs of intracranial involvement.

Answer: D: Perform genetic testing for Leber hereditary optic neuropathy.
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive vision loss, cecocentral scotoma, and mild hyperemia of the optic nerves, along with a positive family history of vision loss in a maternal cousin with multiple sclerosis, suggest the possibility of a genetic disorder affecting the optic nerve. Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the optic nerve and can cause sudden or gradual vision loss, often starting in the fourth or fifth decade of life. LHON is caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA, which are inherited from the mother. The patient's family history and clinical presentation are consistent with LHON, and genetic testing can help confirm the diagnosis.

Therefore, the next step would be to perform genetic testing for LHON. This would involve analyzing a sample of the patient's DNA for the presence of mutations in the mitochondrial genes associated with LHON. If the genetic testing confirms the diagnosis of LHON, the patient can be counseled about the potential risks and benefits of treatment options, such as vitamin supplements and management of symptoms.

The other options are not as appropriate for the patient's clinical presentation and family history. Checking methylmalonic acid levels and repleting vitamin B12 if elevated (Option A) may be relevant for certain neurological conditions, but it is not directly related to the patient's symptoms or family history. Repeating magnetic resonance imaging (Option B) may be useful to monitor the progression of the disease, but it is not likely to provide a definitive diagnosis in this case. Recommending lumbar puncture (Option C) may be appropriate to rule out other conditions, but it is not directly related to the patient's symptoms or family history.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination results suggest that he may have a condition that affects the optic nerve, such as optic neuritis or papilledema. The elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) and normal brain MRI suggest that the cause is likely to be related to increased pressure in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) rather than a space-occupying lesion. Acetazolamide is a medication that can help to reduce ICP by increasing the rate of CSF production and improving its reabsorption. It is commonly used to treat conditions such as idiopathic intracranial hypertension, which is a possible diagnosis in this case.

The other options are not as appropriate for this patient's symptoms and examination results. Amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine are antifungal medications that are used to treat fungal infections, but there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has a fungal infection. Penicillin is an antibiotic that is used to treat bacterial infections, but there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has a bacterial infection. Discontinuing doxycycline, which is an antibiotic that the patient has been taking for malaria prophylaxis, may not be appropriate at this time, as it may leave the patient at risk for malaria infection.

Answer: D: Genetic testing. 
Explanation: The patient's constellation of findings, including posterior embryotoxon, corectopia, iris stromal hypoplasia, translucent strands extending from the inferior segment of the iris toward the cornea, and dysgenesis of the left cerebellar hemisphere and vermis, suggests a genetic etiology. The absence of similar abnormalities in other family members may indicate a novel genetic mutation or variant. Genetic testing can help identify the underlying genetic cause and guide management and counseling for the patient and his family. OCT angiography (option A) may be useful in evaluating the retinal vasculature, but it would not provide information on the genetic cause of the patient's condition. Topical ocular hypotensive therapy (option B) may be used to manage elevated intraocular pressure, but it would not address the underlying genetic cause. Strabismus surgery (option C) may be necessary to address the patient's esotropia, but it would not address the underlying genetic cause or the other associated findings.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and the presence of cutaneous lesions with a negative peripheral blood and bone marrow workup suggest a diagnosis of cutaneous blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (CBPDCN). The immunohistochemical staining results, which showed positivity for CD4-, CD33-, CD43-, CD56-, CD123-, and TCL1-positive neoplastic cells with Ki-67 of 85%, support this diagnosis. The negative staining results for TdT, MUM1, CD3, CD20, Bcl-6, CyclinD1, and CD8 also support the diagnosis of CBPDCN. Additionally, the cytogenetic abnormality del(20)(q11.2q13.3)[8]/46,XY[12] is consistent with CBPDCN. Leukemia cutis (option A) is less likely given the absence of circulating blasts in the peripheral blood and the presence of a skin infiltrate composed of medium-sized, round to oval, or elongated immature precursors. Primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (option B) is also less likely given the absence of a T-cell phenotype and the presence of a plasmacytoid dendritic cell phenotype.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient presented with chest pain and ST-segment elevation on the electrocardiogram, indicating an acute coronary syndrome. The urgent coronary angiography showed thrombolysis in myocardial infarction flow grade 2 in the left anterior descending artery and second diagonal branch, indicating a blockage in the coronary arteries. Performing PCI with drug-eluting stents (option A) would be the most appropriate next step in management, as it can help to open up the blockage and restore blood flow to the affected area of the heart. This procedure has been shown to improve outcomes in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Option B, performing PCI with bioresorbable vascular scaffolds, may also be a viable option, but the evidence for its use in acute coronary syndrome is not as strong as that for drug-eluting stents. Option C, deferring intervention and continuing supportive management, may not be the best option given the severity of the patient's condition and the presence of a blockage in the coronary arteries. Option D, referring for emergency coronary artery bypass grafting surgery, may be considered in certain cases, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management for this patient given the severity of the blockage and the patient's overall clinical presentation.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results, as well as the histopathological findings, are consistent with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). LCH is a rare disorder characterized by the proliferation of Langerhans cells, which are histiocytes that originate from the bone marrow and are found in various tissues, including lymph nodes. The patient's elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and the presence of numerous plasma cells on tissue section are also consistent with LCH. Additionally, the positive staining for CD-30 and S-100 immunostains, which are markers for Langerhans cells, supports this diagnosis. The absence of Grocott methenamine silver, acid-fast, and Warthin-Starry stains, which are typically used to diagnose infectious mononucleosis, also supports the diagnosis of LCH. The patient's age and the absence of any other significant medical history also make LCH a more likely diagnosis than the other options.

Answer: C. Basal cell carcinoma.
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as a slowly growing erythematous plaque on the left lower eyelid with occasional discomfort, and the absence of eyelashes, are consistent with basal cell carcinoma. The dermoscopic findings of an erythematous background, telangiectatic vessels, whitish structureless areas, and whitish scales, are also consistent with basal cell carcinoma. Additionally, the histopathological analysis (hematoxylin-eosin) shows features consistent with basal cell carcinoma, such as a nodular proliferation of basaloid cells with peripheral palisading and clefting. Therefore, option C, Basal cell carcinoma, is the most likely diagnosis.

Option A, Sarcoidosis, is unlikely because the patient does not have any other skin lesions or systemic symptoms consistent with sarcoidosis.

Option B, Discoid lupus erythematosus, is unlikely because the patient does not have any of the characteristic skin findings of discoid lupus erythematosus, such as scaly, crusted, or thickened skin plaques on the face, neck, or scalp.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and imaging findings are consistent with bilateral optic nerve sheath meningioma. The presence of optic nerve atrophy, retinal nerve fiber layer thinning, and bilateral central scotomas suggests that the tumor has been affecting the patient's vision for some time. The fact that the patient's visual acuity has been progressively worsening over the past two years suggests that the tumor is growing and needs to be treated urgently.

Optic nerve sheath biopsy (option B) would be the most appropriate next step in management, as it would allow for a definitive diagnosis of the tumor and guide further treatment. Radiotherapy (option C) may be considered as a subsequent step, but it would not be appropriate as a first line of management without a confirmed diagnosis. Observation (option A) would not be appropriate given the severity of the patient's symptoms and the risk of further vision loss. Optic nerve sheath biopsy and radiotherapy (option D) would also not be appropriate as a first line of management, as biopsy alone would be sufficient to establish the diagnosis and guide further treatment.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's history of LPP and the presence of grouped, monomorphic, noninflammatory papules on the face are consistent with a diagnosis of trichoepitheliomas. Trichoepitheliomas are benign tumors that arise from the hair follicle and are associated with LPP. The patient's lack of a history of severe acne or other inflammatory skin disorders also supports this diagnosis. The histopathologic findings of a 3-mm punch biopsy specimen, which showed a proliferation of small, uniform hair follicles with no evidence of inflammation or fibrosis, are also consistent with trichoepitheliomas.

The other options are less likely diagnoses for the patient's condition. Lichen planopilaris (option A) is a diagnosis that has already been established for the patient's scalp, but it does not typically present with the type of facial papules described in the case. Miliary osteoma cutis (option C) is a rare condition that typically presents with small, flesh-colored papules on the face and scalp, but it is not associated with LPP. Angiofibromas (option D) are benign tumors that can occur in the skin and subcutaneous tissue, but they are not typically associated with LPP and do not have the same histopathologic features as trichoepitheliomas.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as linear moist, eroded, exophytic, condyloma-like plaques on the bilateral submammary folds, intergluteal cleft, and under the abdominal apron, as well as ulcers on the bilateral genitocrural folds, are consistent with pemphigus vegetans. The patient's history of previous surgical excision and split-thickness skin grafting of the genitocrural folds, as well as the failure of adalimumab treatment, also support this diagnosis. Pemphigus vegetans is a rare autoimmune disease that affects the skin and mucous membranes, causing blisters and sores. It is often associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as thyroiditis, vitiligo, and rheumatoid arthritis. The histopathology results (Figure, C and D) show features consistent with pemphigus vegetans, such as acantholysis, keratinocyte necrosis, and a superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate. Therefore, option C, Pemphigus vegetans, is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as nonhealing crusted scalp lesions, petechial hemorrhages, and yellowish crusts, are consistent with multisystem Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). The presence of osteolytic lesions on the skull, as shown in the MRI scan, also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the histopathological analysis of the punch biopsy specimen reveals a subepidermal infiltrate consisting of large cells with kidney-shaped nuclei, which is consistent with LCH. The positive staining for CD1A in the infiltrate further supports this diagnosis. Seborrheic dermatitis (A) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that can cause scalp lesions, but it does not typically present with petechial hemorrhages or osteolytic lesions. Crusted scabies (C) can cause crusted lesions on the scalp, but it is unlikely given the patient's age and the absence of other skin lesions. Psoriasis vulgaris (D) can cause scalp lesions, but it typically presents with well-defined, red, scaly plaques, rather than the nonhealing crusted lesions seen in this patient.

Answer: D
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of self-injury, irritability, agitation, and repetitive behavior are consistent with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The genetic testing results showing a microdeletion of the 16p11.2 region of chromosome 16 also support this diagnosis. A behavioral intervention program, such as applied behavior analysis (ABA), can be effective in reducing symptoms of ASD, including self-injury. Additionally, pharmacotherapy with aripiprazole may be effective in reducing irritability and agitation in patients with ASD. Therefore, option D, referral to a behavioral intervention program plus pharmacotherapy with aripiprazole, is the most appropriate next step in management.

Option A, referral of family members for genetic testing to determine 16p11.2 carrier status, may be appropriate in the future, but it is not the most immediate next step.

Option B, pharmacotherapy with R-baclofen based on the mouse model of 16p11.2 deletion, is not supported by sufficient evidence in humans and may not be effective in reducing symptoms of ASD.

Option C, pharmacotherapy with citalopram for rigidity and repetitive behavior, may be effective in reducing some symptoms of ASD, but it is not specifically approved for the treatment of self-injury.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as pruritus and desquamation on both feet, are consistent with psoriasis. Additionally, the sandal-like appearance of the lesions and the absence of local heat, swelling, or discharge suggest psoriasis rather than other options. Tinea pedis (option A) is a fungal infection that can cause similar symptoms, but the absence of any discharge or crusting suggests psoriasis is more likely. Pityriasis rubra pilaris (option C) typically presents with more widespread lesions and a different appearance.

Explanation: The patient's history of hyperlipidemia and the presence of a missing left testis, along with the large intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal masses, are consistent with a diagnosis of testicular cancer. The elevated β human chorionic gonadotrophin levels also support this diagnosis, as they are often elevated in testicular cancer. The absence of metastasis elsewhere and the presence of lymphadenopathy encircling the aorta, inferior mesenteric artery, and both renal arteries also suggest that the cancer originated in the testis. Colorectal cancer (option A) would not explain the missing testis or the elevated β human chorionic gonadotrophin levels. Bladder cancer (option C) would not explain the intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal masses or the lymphadenopathy. Lymphoma (option D) would not explain the missing testis or the elevated β human chorionic gonadotrophin levels.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and clinical findings, including chronic conjunctivitis, blurry vision, and vitritis, suggest a possible diagnosis of uveitis. The presence of hypofluorescent dots on fluorescein angiography and segmentation of the vessels also support this diagnosis. Therefore, the next step would be to perform laboratory workup for uveitis, which includes blood tests to rule out systemic causes of uveitis, such as infections, autoimmune disorders, and inflammatory conditions. This will help guide further management and treatment decisions.

Option A, surgery, may be necessary later on, but it is not the next step in management. Option B, observation, is not appropriate given the patient's symptoms and clinical findings.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient presents with sudden-onset, painless vision loss in the right eye, along with physical examination findings of large pigment epithelial detachments (PEDs) and associated tears and scrolling of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) on enhanced-depth imaging optical coherence tomography (OCT). Additionally, intravenous fluorescein angiography demonstrated several large window defects with hyperfluorescence in the regions of the RPE tears in the late phase. These findings are consistent with retinal pigment epithelium tears, which can cause vision loss due to serous retinal detachment.

Intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment (option B) is the most appropriate next step in management, as it has been shown to improve vision in patients with retinal pigment epithelium tears and serous retinal detachment. The VEGF treatment will help to reduce the amount of fluid in the retina and prevent further vision loss.

Option A, monitoring the patient, is not sufficient as the patient has already experienced significant vision loss and requires prompt intervention. Option C, referring the patient to a nephrologist for evaluation of kidney function, may be necessary in the future, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management at this time. Option D, providing photodynamic therapy with verteporfin, is not indicated for retinal pigment epithelium tears and is not supported by the clinical findings.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of bilateral progressive painless blurring of vision, metamorphopsia, and acute binocular horizontal diplopia, along with the physical examination findings of bilateral swollen, hyperemic optic discs and multifocal yellowish choroidal lesions, are consistent with a diagnosis of posterior uveitis. The presence of coarse crepitations in the right lung and consolidation in the right lower zone on chest radiograph suggests a possible respiratory infection. However, the patient's history of negative tuberculin skin test, sputum for acid-fast bacilli, and sputum culture suggests that the infection is unlikely to be tuberculous in nature. Given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, it is important to rule out other causes of posterior uveitis, such as sarcoidosis or syphilis. An urgent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain would be appropriate to evaluate for any intracranial inflammatory or infectious processes that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Order urgent magnetic resonance imaging of the brain.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's history of ocular hypertension and narrow angles, along with the presence of pigmentation in the auricles of both ears, suggests the possibility of a systemic condition that may be contributing to the bilateral scleral pigmentation. Reviewing the patient's medical history and systemic medications (option B) would be the most appropriate next step to help identify a potential underlying cause for the pigmentation.

Option A, ordering a B-scan, may be appropriate if the patient had a history of head trauma or other symptoms suggestive of an intracranial lesion, but it is not the most appropriate step given the patient's history and presentation.

Option C, discontinuing antiglaucomatous medications, may be appropriate if the patient's ocular hypertension was thought to be caused by the medications themselves, but there is no indication in the case that this is the case.

Option D, obtaining a 24-hour urine sample, may be appropriate if the patient had a history of certain systemic conditions, such as porphyria, that could be contributing to the pigmentation, but it is not the most appropriate step given the patient's history and presentation.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's worsening hypopyon and elevated intraocular pressure suggest endophthalmitis, an inflammatory condition that can cause severe vision loss if left untreated. Intravitreal antibiotics are the prompt treatment for endophthalmitis, as they target the causative organism and reduce inflammation. Performing another anterior chamber paracentesis procedure and culture (option A) may not be effective in treating endophthalmitis, as the infection is likely to be located in the vitreous cavity, beyond the reach of the paracentesis needle. Corneal biopsy (option B) is not necessary at this point, as the diagnosis of endophthalmitis is already suspected, and biopsy may introduce additional risk of infection. Starting prednisolone eyedrops (option D) may be considered later to reduce inflammation, but it is not the most urgent intervention needed at this stage.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, physical examination results, and imaging studies are consistent with a primary lung adenocarcinoma. The biopsy specimen shows a primary adenocarcinoma with an immunohistochemical profile consistent with pulmonary enteric adenocarcinoma (PEA), which is a subtype of lung adenocarcinoma that is positive for CDX2 and CK20 and negative for TTF-1 and napsin A. The patient's EGFR, ALK, and ROS1 genes are wild type, and there is no evidence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy or extrathoracic disease on positron emission tomography. These findings support the diagnosis of PEA.

The other options are less likely:

A: Metastatic colorectal cancer is unlikely given the patient's age, symptoms, and immunohistochemical profile. Colorectal cancer typically affects older patients and presents with symptoms such as abdominal pain, weight loss, and rectal bleeding. The immunohistochemical profile of colorectal cancer is typically different from PEA, with positive staining for CEA and negative staining for CDX2 and CK20.

C: Adenocarcinoma of unknown primary is a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's age and the presence of a well-circumscribed mass on imaging studies. Adenocarcinoma of unknown primary typically affects older patients and presents with symptoms such as weight loss, fatigue, and dyspnea. Imaging studies often show diffuse disease or multiple lesions, rather than a well-circumscribed mass.

D: Lymphoma is unlikely given the patient's symptoms, physical examination results, and imaging studies. Lymphoma typically presents with symptoms such as fever, night sweats, and weight loss, and imaging studies often show nodal or extranodal involvement. The immunohistochemical profile of lymphoma is typically different from PEA, with positive staining for CD20 and negative staining for CDX2 and CK20.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of palpitations and the abnormal electrocardiogram (ECG) suggest the possibility of a cardiac arrhythmia. The marked right axis deviation and poor R wave progression across the precordial leads V1-V6 suggest a conduction disturbance. In this case, obtaining an ECG with right-sided precordial leads (option C) would be the most appropriate next step to help diagnose the arrhythmia and determine the appropriate course of action.

Option A, obtaining a high-sensitivity troponin I level, may be useful in ruling out myocardial infarction, but it is not directly related to the patient's symptoms of palpitations or the abnormal ECG.

Option B, obtaining a D-dimer level, is not relevant to the patient's symptoms or abnormal ECG and would not help diagnose a cardiac arrhythmia.

Answer: C
Explanation: The clinical presentation of a mass arising from the skull base and nasopharynx with extension into various spaces, along with the patient's history of smoking, suggests a diagnosis of sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma. The immunohistochemical staining profile of the biopsy specimens, which shows positivity for desmin, myogenin, and CD56, and negativity for AE1/AE3, CK 5/6, CK7, CK20, p40, chromogranin, SOX10, HMB45, CD99, and CD20, is consistent with this diagnosis. The presence of a primitive small round cell tumor with a similar IHC profile supports this diagnosis. Therefore, option C, Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, is the most likely diagnosis.

Esthesioneuroblastoma (option A) is a rare neuroendocrine tumor that typically affects the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. It is unlikely in this case because the patient's symptoms and imaging findings suggest a more aggressive and invasive tumor.

Ewing sarcoma (option B) is a malignant tumor that affects the bone and soft tissue. It is unlikely in this case because the patient's age and the location of the tumor are not consistent with the typical presentation of Ewing sarcoma.

Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (option D) is a malignancy that affects the immune system. It is unlikely in this case because the patient's symptoms and imaging findings suggest a more aggressive and invasive tumor, and the IHC staining profile does not support this diagnosis.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of amyloidosis. The presence of a submucosal soft-tissue mass containing punctate calcifications centered in the epiglottis, which is causing significant narrowing of the oropharyngeal and supraglottic laryngeal airways, is consistent with amyloidosis. Additionally, the patient's history of COPD and dyspnea, as well as the echocardiography findings of right atrial and ventricular dilatation and increased thickness of the interventricular septum, are also consistent with amyloidosis. The patient's elevated serum-free λ light chain and proteinuria levels and altered liver function tests are also consistent with amyloidosis. A diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (Answer A) would not explain the patient's symptoms or laboratory results.

Answer: **A** Carotid cochlear dehiscence
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of pulsatile tinnitus with a whooshing quality, exacerbated by holding her breath and turning her head to the left, and relieved by compression of her right neck and turning her head to the right, are consistent with carotid cochlear dehiscence (CCD). CCD is a condition where the bony covering of the carotid artery in the temporal bone is absent or defective, allowing the artery to pulsate and cause tinnitus. The presence of a bruit in the right ear that can be stopped with gentle compression of the neck further supports this diagnosis. The normal results from tuning fork testing and the absence of any vascular masses in the middle ear space also suggest that the tinnitus is not caused by a conductive hearing loss or a vascular tumor. The CT temporal bone scan shows an enlarged internal auditory canal and an aberrant carotid artery, which are consistent with CCD.

The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and examination findings. Semicircular canal dehiscence (B) can also cause pulsatile tinnitus, but it is typically associated with vertigo and nausea, which the patient did not report. Sigmoid sinus diverticulum (C) can cause tinnitus, but it is typically accompanied by a mastoiditis or a sinus infection, which the patient did not have. Aberrant internal carotid artery (D) is a rare condition that can cause tinnitus, but it is not typically associated with a whooshing quality or exacerbation by head movement.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's history of a previous excision of a skin cancer on the right ear, along with the presence of a mass running along the lateral border of the sternocleidomastoid (SCM) muscle, suggests that the mass is likely a traumatic neuroma. Traumatic neuromas are benign tumors that can develop after surgery or trauma to a nerve. The fact that the mass extends posterior and deep to the SCM muscle, as seen on the MRI, supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's symptoms of "electric" and "stabbing" pain are consistent with a neuroma. Thrombophlebitis of the external jugular vein (option B) is less likely given the patient's lack of symptoms such as fever, swelling, or redness in the affected area. Primary nerve sheath tumors (option A) are rare and typically present with symptoms such as numbness, weakness, or pain in the affected nerve distribution, which are not present in this case. Perineural spread of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (option D) is also less likely given the patient's history and the location of the mass.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's rash appears to be a case of epidermal acantholysis, which is a condition where the skin's epidermal cells are separated from each other, creating a brick-wall-like appearance. This condition can be caused by a variety of factors, including bacterial infections, allergies, and genetic predisposition. In this case, the patient's history of manual labor and lack of significant sun exposure suggest that the condition may be related to bacterial infection or irritation. The presence of pseudofolliculitis barbae in the submental and mandibular regions also supports this diagnosis.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to prescribe a topical antimicrobial, such as ketoconazole, to treat any underlying bacterial infection, as well as a topical corticosteroid to reduce inflammation and promote healing. Obtaining a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) level (option B) may also be useful in ruling out diabetes mellitus as a potential underlying cause of the condition, given the patient's family history. However, it is not the most urgent step in managing the patient's current symptoms. Consulting for surgical excision (option D) may be necessary if the condition does not respond to topical treatments, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this time.

Explanation: The patient's history of panhypopituitarism, septo-optic dysplasia, developmental delay, duodenal stricture, and pancreatitis, along with the physical examination findings of tender, pink to purple nodules and plaques on the bilateral lower extremities, and the histopathologic findings of lobular panniculitis and dense neutrophilic infiltration of subcutaneous fat associated with fat necrosis and deposition of granular basophilic material, are consistent with a diagnosis of alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency panniculitis. Alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency is a rare genetic disorder that can cause panniculitis, a condition characterized by inflammation of the subcutaneous fat. The patient's history of pancreatitis and developmental delay may also be related to the alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. Erythema nodosum (option A) is a different condition that can cause tender, painful nodules on the legs, but it is not associated with alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency. Pancreatic panniculitis (option B) is a condition that can cause similar skin findings, but it is associated with pancreatic disease and not alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of numerous hypopigmented, atrophic, and folliculocentric papules on the trunk, with a history of waxing and waning over time, and the presence of central keratin plugs and surrounding erythema on dermoscopy, are consistent with the diagnosis of folliculocentric lichen sclerosus et atrophicus (LS et Atrophicus). The histopathologic findings of hypopigmentation, atrophy, and follicular plugging also support this diagnosis. Lichen amyloidosis (option A) typically presents with more widespread and symmetrical distribution of papules, and histopathologically, there would be a prominent amyloid deposit.

Answer: B 
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea on exertion and left leg claudication, along with the physical examination finding of a diminished left radial pulse, suggest a decrease in blood flow to the left arm and lung. This is consistent with the diagnosis of coronary steal syndrome, which occurs when a grafted vessel, in this case, the LIMA, takes blood flow away from the native coronary arteries, leading to decreased perfusion of the myocardium and symptoms. The coronary angiography image provided in the case shows a significant stenosis in the proximal LAD, which is consistent with the patient's history of previous stenting in this vessel. Therefore, option B, coronary steal syndrome, is the most likely diagnosis. Option A, normal coronary angiography, is incorrect as there is evident stenosis in the LAD. Option C, subclavian steal syndrome, is also incorrect as the patient's symptoms do not suggest decreased blood flow to the arm, and the physical examination finding of a diminished left radial pulse suggests decreased blood flow to the left arm. Option D, subclavian stenosis, is incorrect as there is no mention of any symptoms or findings suggestive of a blockage in the subclavian artery.

The presence of a right upper lobe lung mass on chest radiograph, which was confirmed to be T2N2M0 stage III non–small-cell lung cancer on biopsy, supports this diagnosis. Pars plana vitrectomy with drainage of subretinal fluid would be an appropriate next step in management, as it can help to relieve vision-threatening complications such as subretinal fluid and prevent further vision loss. Choroidal biopsy of the right eye lesion (option A) may also be considered, but given the patient's symptoms and findings, pars plana vitrectomy is a more urgent and appropriate step in management at this time. Serial plasmapheresis (option C) and bilateral external-beam radiotherapy (option D) may also be considered in the future, but are not the most appropriate next steps in management.

Answer: C
Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and clinical presentation suggest a possible diagnosis of a conjunctival nodule, which can be caused by various factors, including infection, inflammation, or tumors. The patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis and the presence of a firm, nonvascular, and slightly mobile lesion on the bulbar conjunctiva suggest that the lesion may be a nodule. The fact that the patient has been taking oral methotrexate, which can cause immunosuppression, increases the likelihood of an infectious etiology. The positive culture for Propionibacterium acnes supports this diagnosis.

Given these findings, the best course of action would be to perform an excisional biopsy to establish a definitive diagnosis. This would allow for the removal of the lesion and provide a tissue sample for further analysis. Option C, perform excisional biopsy, is therefore the correct answer.

Option A, initiate oral colchicine therapy, may be considered for its anti-inflammatory properties, but it would not be the most appropriate next step in this case, as the patient's symptoms and clinical presentation suggest a possible infectious etiology, rather than an inflammatory condition.

Option B, observe with serial examinations, may be appropriate for certain cases, but in this case, the patient's symptoms and clinical presentation suggest a more urgent need for intervention.

Option D, perform intralesional dexamethasone injection, may be considered for its anti-inflammatory properties, but it would not be the most appropriate next step in this case, as the patient's symptoms and clinical presentation suggest a possible infectious etiology, rather than an inflammatory condition.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient has persistent peripheral retinal avascularity and arteriovenous anastomoses, indicating that the previous intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy did not fully address the issue. Administering combined intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy and laser photocoagulation to areas of nonperfusion (option C) may help to further address the retinal avascularity and prevent potential complications such as retinal neovascularization or recurrent ROP. The other options do not address the underlying issue of retinal avascularity and may not prevent potential complications. Therefore, option C is the most appropriate choice.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of recurrent, transient vision loss in the right eye, along with the physical examination findings of mild cataract and dry eye, suggest a possible diagnosis of ocular migraine. Ocular migraine is a type of migraine that affects only one eye and can cause temporary vision loss or blindness in that eye. The fact that the symptoms occur after using an electronic reader tablet in dim lighting while lying on her left side and resolve immediately upon turning on the lights suggests that the patient may be experiencing ocular migraine triggered by ocular hypotony, which is a decrease in pressure within the eye. The presence of a stable, enhancing orbital mass on MRI and CT scans, without any other abnormalities on imaging, supports the diagnosis of ocular migraine. Therefore, the next step would be to observe the patient and manage her symptoms with medications, lifestyle modifications, or other treatments for ocular migraine, rather than performing an echocardiogram and Holter monitoring (Option A), biopsying the orbital mass (Option B), or performing a hypercoagulability workup (Option D).

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's presentation of congenital restrictive strabismus with a history of orbital capillary hemangioma and enlarged extraocular muscles on MRI suggests the possibility of congenital fibrosis of extraocular muscles. This is a rare condition characterized by the abnormal growth and fibrosis of extraocular muscles, which can result in restrictive strabismus and other ocular motor abnormalities. Genetic testing can help confirm the diagnosis and identify potential genetic causes. Therefore, the next step would be to perform genetic testing for congenital fibrosis of extraocular muscles.

The other options are not the most appropriate next steps for the following reasons:

A. Investigating for systemic involvement may be relevant for other conditions, but it is not directly related to the patient's ocular symptoms and diagnosis.

C. Strabismus surgery may be necessary in the future, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this point, as the underlying cause of the strabismus needs to be identified and addressed first.

D. Orbital biopsy may be considered if the diagnosis is uncertain, but it is invasive and carries risks. In this case, the diagnosis of congenital fibrosis of extraocular muscles can be made through genetic testing, which is less invasive and carries fewer risks.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of recurrent pain, redness, and decreased visual acuity, along with the presence of a layered hypopyon and increased anterior chamber cells, suggest that the inflammation is still active. Performing another vitreous tap and intravitreal vancomycin injection (Option B) may not be effective in controlling the inflammation, as the cultures yielded no growth. Intraocular lens explantation, capsulectomy, and intravitreal vancomycin injection (Option C) may be necessary to treat the chronic inflammation and remove any potential inflammatory source. Consulting an infectious diseases specialist (Option A) may also be helpful in managing the patient's condition. However, given the patient's history of recurrent inflammation and the presence of a hypopyon, surgical intervention may be necessary to effectively treat the condition. Therefore, Option C is the most appropriate answer.

Answer: C. Mycosis fungoides.
Explanation: Mycosis fungoides (MF) is a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that typically presents with patches, plaques, and nodules on the skin. The patient's symptoms of gradually worsening pruritic plaques and nodules on the scalp, face, neck, chest, abdomen, arms, and thighs, as well as the development of diffuse urticarial lesions, are consistent with MF. The patient's history of taking valproic acid and phenytoin, which are known to cause exfoliative dermatitis, suggests that the patient may have developed a reactive lymphomatoid reaction secondary to drugs. However, the negative TRG rearrangement analysis by PCR and the dense band-like lymphoid infiltrate in the superficial dermis with mild epidermotropism observed in the second biopsy specimen are not consistent with a reactive lymphomatoid reaction. The patient's condition worsening over a 6-month period, with increasing numbers and thickness of plaques and nodules, and the development of early leonine facies, are also consistent with MF. Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and biopsy results, the most likely diagnosis is Mycosis fungoides.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing, nighttime nasal congestion, and the presence of a nasopharyngeal mass on endoscopy and imaging studies are consistent with a diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The patient's age and lack of respiratory issues at birth make it less likely that the mass is a congenital anomaly such as a dermoid or salivary gland anlage tumor. The vascularity of the tumor and the need for preoperative embolization also support this diagnosis. The final pathologic results, which demonstrate keratinizing squamous cysts and collections of ductal structures set within a myxoid stroma, with small nests of primitive mesenchyme, are consistent with a diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

Answer: C 
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and the appearance of the lesion suggest an intraoral lipoma. A lipoma is a benign tumor composed of fat cells, and it can cause pain and swelling in the affected area. The fact that the lesion is hard and bleeds with palpation supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the location of the lesion, adjacent to the maxillary first molar, is consistent with the typical location of intraoral lipomas. While mucoepidermoid carcinoma (A) and sialolith (B) can also cause swelling and pain in the oral cavity, they are less likely given the patient's age and the appearance of the lesion. Unusual mucocele (D) is a rare diagnosis and typically presents with a soft, bluish swelling. Therefore, option C is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of pain in the submandibular area, along with the presence of a mass adjacent to the submandibular gland, suggest a possible diagnosis of a hypoglossal nerve schwannoma. This type of tumor is known to occur in the submandibular region and can cause pain and numbness in the tongue and floor of mouth. The patient's history of bruxism and long-term use of a bite guard may have contributed to the development of the tumor.

The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and imaging findings as well. Option A, submandibular gland pleomorphic adenoma, is a benign tumor that can occur in the submandibular gland, but it is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and the location of the mass. Option B, chronic lymphadenitis, is not supported by the imaging findings or the patient's symptoms. Option D, chronic submandibular sialadenitis, is a possibility, but it is less likely given the presence of a mass and the patient's history of bruxism.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is a hypoglossal nerve schwannoma.

Answer: C. Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma.
Explanation:
The given clinical case describes a male patient in his 60s with a supraclavicular cutaneous mass that has been present for 2 years. The patient experiences occasional pruritus but is otherwise asymptomatic. A shave biopsy reveals islands of large epithelioid cells with an increased mitotic index surrounded by a dense lymphocytic infiltrate. The tumor cells express p16, EMA, p63, and CK903, but are negative for prostate-specific antigen, CDX2, thyroid transcription factor 1, S-100, chromogranin, synaptophysin, and CD56. In situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is also negative.
Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma (LELC). LELC is a rare type of cutaneous carcinoma that is characterized by a combination of epithelial and lymphoid markers. The presence of p16 expression and the absence of EBV in situ hybridization support this diagnosis.
The other options are less likely due to the following reasons:
A. Metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma: The patient's age and the location of the supraclavicular mass make this diagnosis less likely. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is more common in older patients and typically presents with symptoms such as neck mass, nasal obstruction, and hearing loss.
B. Melanoma: The patient's age and the absence of melanotic pigmentation make this diagnosis less likely. Melanoma is more common in younger patients and typically presents with a pigmented lesion.
D. Cutaneous lymphadenoma: This diagnosis is less likely due to the absence of any significant lymphadenopathy or other evidence of systemic lymphoma.
Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C: Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of postprandial retrosternal burning, which are persistent despite treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), suggest that she may have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The results of the esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) and esophageal mucosal biopsies were normal, which rules out other possible causes of her symptoms. Therefore, it is appropriate to refer her to a surgeon for consideration of antireflux surgery, which is the most effective treatment for GERD that is resistant to medical therapy.

Increasing the dose of esomeprazole to 40 mg twice daily (option A) may provide some benefit, but it is unlikely to be effective in the long term, given that the patient has already tried PPIs without success.

Performing a barium esophagogram (option B) may help to diagnose other conditions such as esophageal stricture or cancer, but it is not the most appropriate test for diagnosing GERD.

Replacing esomeprazole with nortriptyline (option D) is not a appropriate next step, as nortriptyline is an antidepressant and not an acid-suppressing medication. It may be considered in the future if the patient's symptoms are found to be refractory to surgical intervention.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are concerning for a peristomal nodule, which is a common complication in patients with a colostomy. The nodule's proximity to the stoma, its size, shape, and color, as well as the presence of an ulcer and pus-like drainage, are all consistent with this diagnosis. It is important to obtain a biopsy of the nodule to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes, such as a skin infection or cancer. Option B is the best answer because it allows for a definitive diagnosis and guide further management. Option A may be appropriate if there is a concern for infection, but it would not provide a definitive diagnosis. Option C is not necessary at this time, as the patient's stoma appears to be well-perfused. Option D may be considered if the patient experiences symptoms of pruritus or irritation, but it would not address the underlying cause of the nodule.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and test results point to annular lichenoid dermatitis of youth as the most likely diagnosis. The presence of erythematous annular patches on the trunk, arms, and groin, with slightly raised red-brown borders and a clear center, is consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's age and lack of other underlying conditions or medications also support this diagnosis. The histopathologic findings of superficial lymphocytic infiltrates in the papillary and superficial reticular dermis, prominent vacuolar changes at the dermoepidermal junction, and mild lymphocytic exocytosis are also consistent with annular lichenoid dermatitis of youth. Mycosis fungoides (option B) is less likely given the absence of scaling, hypopigmentation, induration, or atrophy, and the lack of any malignant cells in the biopsy sample. Pigmented purpuric dermatosis (option A) is also less likely given the absence of any purpuric lesions or any history of atopic dermatitis or other eczematous dermatoses. Secondary syphilis (option D) is unlikely given the absence of any other symptoms or signs of syphilis and the negative serologic testing.

Answer: C
Explanation: Erythema induratum is a cutaneous condition characterized by the development of painful, indurated plaques on the legs. The patient's symptoms, including the appearance of the ulcer and the numerous violaceous to dull red, indurated plaques on the posterior aspect of the legs, are consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of moving to Canada from China 30 years ago and being unsure about tuberculosis (TB) exposure and Bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccine status increases the likelihood of this diagnosis, as erythema induratum is more common in individuals who have been exposed to TB. The negative wound cultures for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi also support this diagnosis, as erythema induratum is not typically associated with infection.

In contrast, infective panniculitides (answer A) is a broader term that refers to any infection of the subcutaneous tissue, and may not necessarily be associated with TB exposure. Erythema nodosum (answer B) is a condition characterized by the development of tender, red nodules on the shins, and is typically associated with a respiratory infection or other inflammatory condition. Pyoderma gangrenosum (answer D) is a condition characterized by the development of painful, necrotic ulcers on the skin, and is typically associated with a bacterial infection. While the patient's ulcer may resemble pyoderma gangrenosum, the absence of any other symptoms or signs of infection, such as fever or chills, and the negative wound cultures, make this diagnosis less likely.

Additionally, the presence of prominent dermal melanophages supports this diagnosis. Dowling-Degos disease is a rare genodermatosis characterized by reticulated hyperpigmentation and eosinophilic spongiosis. It is important to note that the patient's history of previous diagnosis of atopic dermatitis and treatment with potent topical corticosteroids and oral prednisone, without improvement, also supports the diagnosis of Dowling-Degos disease, as it can be a challenging condition to diagnose and treat.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive weakness and sensory changes, along with the MRI findings of a growing lesion in the right basal ganglia and thalamus with heterogeneous high signal intensity and multicystic change, are consistent with a germinoma. This type of tumor is typically located in the pineal or suprasellar region, but can also occur in other parts of the brain, such as the basal ganglia. The patient's age and lack of a family history of tumors also support this diagnosis. The normal HCG levels in both serum and CSF and the normal pituitary function suggest that the tumor is not secreting HCG, which is consistent with a germinoma.

Explanation: Waardenburg syndrome type 1 is characterized by lateral displacement of the inner canthi, broad nasal root, small nostrils, and medial eyebrow flare, which are all present in the child and his father in this case. Additionally, the father's hypopigmented patch on the left arm and bright blue eyes are also consistent with Waardenburg syndrome type 1. The fact that the child's parents are deaf and have a family history of deafness, and the presence of a homozygous mutation in the connexin 26 gene (GJB2) in the mother, suggest that the child may also have a genetic hearing loss. However, the absence of other relatives with hearing impairment and the normal hearing screening results at birth and follow-up suggest that the child's hearing loss may not be due to the same genetic mutation as his parents. Therefore, Waardenburg syndrome type 1 is the most likely diagnosis for the child and his father. Stickler syndrome, X-linked Alport syndrome, and autosomal dominant GJB2 gene mutation are less likely diagnoses, as they do not explain the lateral displacement of the inner canthi or the father's hypopigmented patch and bright blue eyes.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of blurry vision in one eye, along with the physical examination findings of tortuosity and dilation of all branches of the retinal vein, disc edema, scattered intraretinal hemorrhages, and nasal macula nerve fiber layer infarcts, suggest a possible diagnosis of central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). CRVO is a blockage of the central retinal vein, which can cause vision loss in one eye. The patient's history of oral contraception use and young age suggest a possible association with hypercoagulability. Therefore, it is important to review the patient's medical and family history for any hypercoagulable or inflammatory systemic diseases that may have contributed to the development of CRVO. This would include a history of thrombophilia, autoimmune disorders, or inflammatory conditions such as giant cell arteritis. Additionally, laboratory tests such as a complete blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and anticardiolipin antibodies may be ordered to rule out any underlying systemic conditions that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with ocular sarcoidosis, an inflammatory disease that can affect various organs, including the eyes. The positive proteinase 3–antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) testing and interferon γ release assay using QuantiFERON-TB gold (QFT) (Qiagen) support this diagnosis. The presence of pulmonary nodules on chest computed tomography also suggests a possible systemic involvement. Initiating rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol (RIPE) therapy would be appropriate to treat the patient's sarcoidosis, as it is a common treatment regimen for the disease. Performing an incisional biopsy (option A) may not be necessary given the patient's symptoms and examination findings, and may not provide a definitive diagnosis. Prescribing oral prednisone (option B) may be considered as a corticosteroid therapy to reduce inflammation, but it is not the most appropriate next step.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of palpitations, breathlessness, and light-headedness, along with a family history of sudden cardiac death, suggest a potential arrhythmic disorder. The patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) and 24-hour Holter monitoring trace show frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) and ventricular tachycardia (VT), which support this suspicion. Implanting a device to determine the frequency of ventricular tachycardia, such as an implantable loop recorder, would be the next appropriate step to further evaluate the patient's arrhythmic activity and determine the best course of management. This would provide more detailed information about the frequency, duration, and timing of the arrhythmic events, which would help guide further diagnostic testing and potential treatment.

While an invasive electrophysiological study (Option A) may also be considered, it may not be necessary at this stage, given the patient's relatively stable condition and the availability of less invasive diagnostic options.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as dyspnea, limitation of neck movements, and neck tightness, are consistent with a large neck mass. The imaging findings, including a homogenous ovoid bilobulated cystic mass with fibrous septae in the central and inferior parts, extension to the supraclavicular region, and no sign of invasion, are also consistent with a lipomas. Additionally, the patient's age and lack of antecedent neck trauma or infection suggest that the mass is unlikely to be a branchial cleft cyst or a glomus tumor. Finally, the preservation of vital structures of the neck during surgery, such as cranial nerve XI and sternocleoidomastoid muscle, supports the diagnosis of a lipomas. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Liposarcoma.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of nasopharyngeal swelling, mucopurulent secretions, and ulceration, as well as the radiographic findings of a rim-enhancing, multilocular hypodense collection, are consistent with acute invasive fungal sinusitis (AIFS). The patient's history of cystic fibrosis and recent bilateral lung transplantation increase her risk for developing AIFS. The presence of necrotic debris in the nasopharynx and oropharynx supports the diagnosis of AIFS. Mycobacterial abscess (option A) is less likely given the patient's recent surgery and lack of symptoms consistent with mycobacterial infection.

Additionally, the lack of clinical signs of endocrinopathy and the absence of involvement of other bones on the skeletal survey also support this diagnosis. Paget disease of bone, on the other hand, is a condition that causes abnormal bone remodeling and can lead to deformities, but it typically affects older adults and is associated with elevated serum alkaline phosphatase levels, which were normal in this patient. Gardner syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that can cause multiple osteochondromas (benign bone tumors), but it typically presents with other symptoms such as intestinal polyps and epidermoid cysts, which are not mentioned in the case. Florid osseous dysplasia is not a recognized medical condition. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is fibrous dysplasia.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of left facial and eye pain with intermittent diplopia on upward and lateral gaze, along with the physical examination findings of left abducens nerve palsy and an afferent pupillary defect, are consistent with a diagnosis of a tumor affecting the left orbit. The imaging findings of a well-circumscribed posterior-medial extraconal mass extending into the orbital apex with smooth, nonaggressive bony remodeling and expansion of the left superior orbital fissure with further dorsal extension into the left cavernous sinus, and the histopathologic findings of a myxoid tumor with negative FUS-CHOP fusion oncogene on fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), are consistent with a diagnosis of liposarcoma, pleomorphic myxoid variant. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Liposarcoma, pleomorphic myxoid variant.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of partial nail loss, pain, and intermittent drainage, along with the physical examination findings of an ulcerated nodule and purulent drainage, suggest an infectious etiology. The histopathologic findings of a pyogenic granuloma-like response with atypical epithelioid and spindled cells adjacent to blood vessels also support this diagnosis. Therefore, it would be appropriate to perform tissue culture for bacterial and fungal organisms to identify the specific cause of the infection and guide appropriate treatment. Immunohistochemical analysis (option B) may also be useful in identifying specific markers of infection, but tissue culture is a more appropriate next step given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Cryotherapy (option A) may be considered for treatment of certain types of nail lesions, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case given the patient's history of pyogenic granuloma and ongoing symptoms. Providing reassurance (option D) without further evaluation and treatment may not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's thrombocytopenia (low platelet count) is likely due to heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), a known side effect of heparin therapy. HIT is caused by the formation of antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4), which is released from platelets and binds to heparin, leading to platelet activation and destruction. The patient's history of recent heparin therapy and the development of new thromboses (femoral vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) suggest that HIT is the most likely cause of thrombocytopenia in this case. Therefore, it would be appropriate to replace heparin with argatroban, an alternative anticoagulant that does not cause HIT.

Option A, continuing heparin therapy, would not be appropriate as it may exacerbate the thrombocytopenia and increase the risk of bleeding complications.

Option C, replacing piperacillin-tazobactam with meropenem, is not necessary as there is no evidence to suggest that the patient's thrombocytopenia is caused by antibiotic-induced thrombocytopenia.

Option D, transfusing platelets, may be considered for the risk of postoperative bleeding, but it would not address the underlying cause of thrombocytopenia.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as the nonhealing ulcer on the left foot, the multiple hypopigmented asymptomatic lesions on the face and scalp, and the enlarged inguinal lymph nodes, are consistent with post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis. This diagnosis is supported by the histopathological findings of intracellular and extracellular inclusion bodies in the skin biopsy specimen. Additionally, the patient's history of previous treatment with multidrug therapy for multibacillary leprosy, which was ineffective, suggests that the current condition is not leprosy. Therefore, option C is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The clinical presentation of blanchable, salmon-colored, monomorphic macules and fine telangiectasias localized to a single lower extremity, along with the absence of mucosal, conjunctival, or nail involvement, suggests a diagnosis of cutaneous collagenous vasculopathy (CCV). The histopathological findings of concentric deposits of hyaline material surrounding dilated and thickened capillaries within the papillary dermis, and the strong highlighting of perivascular hyaline deposits by periodic acid-Schiff stain, further support this diagnosis. CCV is a rare condition characterized by the accumulation of hyaline material in the walls of small blood vessels, leading to vessel thickening and formation of telangiectasias. It is important to differentiate CCV from other conditions that may present with similar clinical features, such as essential telangiectasia, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and pigmented purpuric dermatosis, Schamberg type. In this case, the absence of any symptoms or signs of bleeding tendencies or hypercoagulability, as well as the lack of mucosal, conjunctival, or nail involvement, argue against a diagnosis of leukocytoclastic vasculitis or pigmented purpuric dermatosis, Schamberg type. Essential telangiectasia is a possible diagnosis, but the presence of hyaline deposits in the walls of blood vessels and the lack of any other telangiectasias on the body argue in favor of CCV.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as severe fatigue, cachexia, and muscular weakness, are consistent with hyperparathyroidism. The large tumor on the distal part of the right fourth finger, which has gradually enlarged in recent months, is also consistent with a brown tumor. The histopathology results show numerous giant cells with multiple osteoclast-like nuclei, which is consistent with the diagnosis of a brown tumor. Additionally, the laboratory evaluation reveals hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and elevated serum parathyroid hormone, which are all consistent with hyperparathyroidism. A chest radiograph revealed an important and unexplained deformation of the ribs, which could be due to the hyperparathyroidism. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Brown Tumor.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as the loss of normal hair and replacement with "peach fuzz," and the presence of follicular hyperkeratosis and perifollicular erythema, are consistent with Monilethrix. Monilethrix is a rare genetic disorder that affects the hair growth cycle and causes brittle, fragile hair that is prone to breakage. The fact that the patient's eyebrows and lashes are not affected, and that there are no other skin or nail abnormalities, also supports this diagnosis. Tinea capitis (option A) is a fungal infection of the scalp that can cause hair loss, but it typically presents with scaling, inflammation, and broken hairs, rather than the "peach fuzz" appearance described in this case. Psoriasis (option B) can also cause hair loss and scalp lesions, but it typically presents with red, scaly patches and plaques, rather than the follicular hyperkeratosis and perifollicular erythema seen in this case. Menkes disease (option D) is a rare genetic disorder that affects copper metabolism and can cause hair loss, but it typically presents with a more widespread distribution of hair loss and other systemic symptoms, such as neurological problems and copper deficiency.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, vomiting, and abnormal lab results (elevated amylase and lipase) suggest a possible small-bowel perforation. The absence of free abdominal fluid on ultrasound and the presence of a thickened bowel wall on CT scan support this diagnosis.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of right lower quadrant pain, numbness in the right lower limb, and nausea and vomiting, along with the positive Blumberg sign and elevated Alvarado score, are consistent with acute appendicitis. The ultrasonographic findings of a tubular structure in the RIF consistent with a mildly inflamed appendix and stratification of the appendiceal wall, as well as the presence of free fluid in the Douglas pouch, further support this diagnosis. The patient's history of recent onset of symptoms and the absence of any other obvious causes of her symptoms also suggest acute appendicitis as the most likely diagnosis.

While salpingitis or sactosalpinx (option B) could also cause similar symptoms, the ultrasonographic findings do not support this diagnosis, as there is no evidence of fluid collection or abscess in the pelvis. Heterotopic pregnancy (option C) is unlikely given the presence of a normal intrauterine pregnancy on ultrasound and the absence of any other signs of pregnancy complications. Nonspecific abdominal pain or pelvic inflammatory disease (option D) is also unlikely given the patient's age and the presence of a normal intrauterine pregnancy.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with uveitis, specifically posterior uveitis. The presence of microaneurysms, dot-blot hemorrhage, and chorioretinal lesions with central hypofluorescence and peripheral hyperfluorescence on fluorescein angiography support this diagnosis. The patient's recent history of West Nile virus (WNV) encephalitis increases the likelihood of a viral etiology for the uveitis. Given the patient's symptoms and examination findings, it would be appropriate to perform a biopsy of the chorioretinal lesion to determine the underlying cause of the uveitis. This would help guide further management and treatment.

Option A, ordering vitreous biopsy, may not provide the same information as a biopsy of the chorioretinal lesion, as the vitreous may not be affected in the same way as the retina.

Option B, ordering magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, may be appropriate to rule out other potential causes of uveitis, such as a brain tumor or inflammatory condition, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case.

Option D, observing the patient, may be appropriate for a short period of time to monitor for any changes in the patient's symptoms or examination findings, but it is not an adequate next step in this case given the patient's symptoms and examination findings.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of sudden vision loss, bilateral eyelid, lip, and feet swelling, and new-onset right facial palsy, along with the physical examination findings of relative afferent pupillary defect and decreased color vision, suggest a possible central nervous system (CNS) involvement. The presence of optic nerve head edema and peripapillary hemorrhages bilaterally, greater in the left eye than in the right eye, is consistent with lymphomatous optic nerve infiltration. Given the patient's history of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma and stem cell transplant, it is likely that the vision loss is related to the lymphoma infiltrating the optic nerves. An MRI of the orbits and brain would be the most appropriate next step to evaluate the extent of CNS involvement and to determine the best course of treatment. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Order magnetic resonance imaging for the orbits and brain.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and clinical findings, including the yellowish orange discontinuity in the inferior peripapillary region of the optic conus, suggest the presence of a peripapillary choroidal effusion. This is a type of intraocular tumor that can cause vision loss if left untreated. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits is the appropriate next step to evaluate the extent of the tumor and determine if it has spread beyond the eye. Option B, immediate demarcation with indirect argon laser barricade, is not appropriate as it is not a proven treatment for peripapillary choroidal effusions. Option C, indocyanine green angiography and photodynamic therapy, may be considered in certain cases, but MRI is the first step in evaluating the extent of the tumor. Option D, visual field testing and close observation for serous macular detachment, may be appropriate in cases of suspected serous retinal detachment, but it is not the most appropriate next step given the patient's symptoms and clinical findings.

The presence of a creamy fluctuant elevated lesion temporally also raises concern for a possible abscess or cellulitis. Given these findings, it would be appropriate to perform exploratory surgery in the operating room to evaluate the extent of the infection and to potentially drain any abscess that may be present. Intravenous antibiotics would also be appropriate to treat any underlying bacterial infection. Therefore, option C is the best answer.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's history of recurrent oral cancer and the presence of a new lesion on the palate, as well as the metabolic activity in the left vocal cord, suggest a primary laryngeal carcinoma. The patient's history of tobacco use and previous head and neck cancer also increase the likelihood of a primary laryngeal carcinoma. The focal fludeoxyglucose F 18 localization within the known oral cavity SCC and in a small, level IIA lymph node, located lateral to the upper right internal jugular vein, supports the diagnosis of primary laryngeal carcinoma.

The other options are less likely given the patient's history and the findings on PET scan. Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma (option A) is possible, but the patient's history of recurrent oral cancer and the presence of a new lesion on the palate suggest a primary laryngeal carcinoma. Inflammatory reaction (option C) is unlikely given the patient's history of cancer and the metabolic activity in the left vocal cord. Postradiation change (option D) is also unlikely given the patient's history of recurrent cancer and the presence of a new lesion.

Answer: D: Genetic testing.
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive muscle weakness, dyspnea on exertion, and leg swelling, along with his family history of early death of his maternal uncle due to congestive heart failure and his younger brother's progressive weakness, suggest the possibility of an inherited cardiomyopathy. The patient's elevated serum creatine kinase level and creatine kinase–MB fraction level also support this diagnosis. Genetic testing can help identify specific genetic mutations that may be associated with inherited cardiomyopathies, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, or arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia. Therefore, genetic testing would be the next appropriate step in the patient's diagnostic workup.

The other options are not as appropriate for the following reasons:

A: Treadmill stress test may be useful in evaluating the patient's exercise capacity and identifying any ischemic changes, but it would not provide information about the underlying genetic cause of his cardiomyopathy.

B: Cardiac catheterization may be necessary in the future to evaluate the patient's coronary arteries and left ventricular function, but it would not provide information about the genetic cause of his cardiomyopathy.

C: Electrophysiological study may be useful in evaluating the patient's arrhythmia risk, but it would not provide information about the underlying genetic cause of his cardiomyopathy.

Answer: B
Explanation: The clinical case describes a patient with an asymptomatic septal mass that has been slowly enlarging over a two-month period. The patient denies any history of localized trauma, substance abuse, or prior endonasal surgery. The histopathological analysis reveals a well-circumscribed submucosal lesion comprised of bland, round, syncytial cells arranged in a concentric fashion around variably sized slit-like vascular spaces, with a minority of which were staghorn in appearance. The lesional cells are positive for smooth-muscle actin (SMA), muscle-specific actin, and CD34, but negative for B-catenin and epithelial membrane antigen.

Based on the clinical and histopathological findings, the most likely diagnosis is Myofibroma. Myofibroma is a rare benign tumor that originates from the myofibroblasts of the nasal septum. It typically presents as a slow-growing, asymptomatic mass in the nasal septum, as seen in this case. The histopathological features, such as the arrangement of cells around blood vessels and the positive staining for myoid markers, are also consistent with Myofibroma.

Glomus tumor, Solitary fibrous tumor, and Myopericytoma are less likely diagnoses based on the clinical and histopathological findings. Glomus tumors are typically located in the dermis or subcutaneous tissue and are characterized by a distinctive glomus-like pattern of arrangement of cells around blood vessels. Solitary fibrous tumors are usually located in the soft tissue of the head and neck and have a more spindle-shaped cell morphology. Myopericytoma is a rare benign tumor that originates from the pericytes of blood vessels and typically has a more irregular cell morphology.

Therefore, the answer is B: Myofibroma.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of dysphagia and pharyngeal obstruction, along with the physical examination findings of a large smooth nonulcerated right base of tongue mass and almost complete pharyngeal airway obstruction, suggest a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The patient's history of minimal and distant tobacco use and social alcohol use also supports this diagnosis, as SCC is commonly associated with tobacco and alcohol use. The histopathological analysis of the tongue lesion, which shows a sheet-like growth pattern with Azzopardi-type crush artifactual distortion of the neoplastic cells, is also consistent with SCC. Additionally, the positive immunoreactivity for cytokeratin 7 and synaptophysin, and the high mitotic rate, are all consistent with SCC. The negative immunoreactivity for CK 5 and 6, CK 20, NUT, p63, and chromogranin, and the absence of HPV 6, 11, and 18 DNA, also support this diagnosis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is squamous cell carcinoma.

The patient's history of meningitis and treatment with intravenous antibiotics and steroids also support this diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's presentation of congenital horizontal nystagmus, hypopigmentation of the hair, eyelashes, and iris, and a history of cutaneous melanoma suggest a diagnosis of oculocutaneous albinism (OCA). This is a genetic disorder that affects the production of melanin, leading to hypopigmentation of the skin, hair, and eyes. The patient's ancestry and age of onset of nystagmus also support this diagnosis. OCA is associated with a risk of developing skin cancer, especially melanoma, and other complications such as vision loss, photophobia, and increased risk of infections. Therefore, it is important to inquire about the patient's history of frequent infections and abnormal bleeding, as these could be related to the underlying genetic disorder. Performing a dilated ophthalmic examination (option A) may also be useful in assessing the patient's ocular health, but it is not the most appropriate next step given the patient's symptoms and medical history. Ordering molecular genetic testing (option B) may also be considered, but it is not necessary at this point, as the diagnosis of OCA can be made based on the patient's clinical presentation and medical history. Counseling the patient to avoid sun exposure (option D) is important, but it is not the most pressing concern given the patient's history of melanoma and risk of recurrence.

Answer: C
Explanation: The clinical presentation of multiple annular, indurated, dusky red plaques with central clearing and trailing scale on the trunk, as well as the histopathological findings of a perivascular and periadnexal infiltrate, are consistent with a diagnosis of granuloma annulare. This condition is characterized by the formation of small, round, or annular lesions on the skin that are typically red or violaceous in color and have a central area of clearing or atrophy. The lesions are often associated with a mild inflammatory response and may be distributed on the trunk, arms, and legs. In this case, the patient's history of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and juvenile xanthogranulomas increases the likelihood of a diagnosis of granuloma annulare, as this condition is known to occur in association with NF1. Treatment with griseofulvin and clotrimazole, which are commonly used to treat fungal infections, had not improved the rash, further supporting the diagnosis of granuloma annulare. Interstitial granulomatous dermatitis (option B) is a less likely diagnosis, as it typically presents with more widespread and painful skin lesions, and the histopathological findings are different. Erythema annulare centrifugum (option A) is a rare condition characterized by the formation of small, round, or annular lesions on the skin that are typically red or violaceous in color and have a central area of clearing or atrophy, but it is not associated with NF1. Leukemia cutis (option D) is a rare condition characterized by the infiltration of the skin by leukemic cells, and it is not associated with NF1.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's history of essential thrombocytosis and the presence of a large, stellate ulcer on her left distal lower leg suggest a diagnosis of cutaneous microvascular occlusion secondary to essential thrombocytosis. The violaceous, reticulated plaques on the patient's hands and forearms, as well as the scaly, violaceous plaques on the thenar and radial aspects of her fingers, are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's treatment with hydroxyurea and rivaroxaban also supports this diagnosis, as hydroxyurea is commonly used to treat essential thrombocytosis and can cause cutaneous side effects. The absence of other constitutional symptoms, such as fever, weakness, or myalgias, also supports this diagnosis.

The other options are less likely diagnoses for this patient's condition. Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (option A) is a chronic autoimmune disease that can cause skin lesions, but it is less likely in this case given the patient's history of essential thrombocytosis and the absence of other autoimmune symptoms. Hydroxyurea-induced dermatomyositis-like eruption (option C) is a known side effect of hydroxyurea, but it is less likely in this case given the patient's history of essential thrombocytosis and the absence of other symptoms consistent with dermatomyositis. Polyarteritis nodosa (option D) is a systemic vasculitis that can cause skin lesions, but it is less likely in this case given the patient's history of essential thrombocytosis and the absence of other symptoms consistent with polyarteritis nodosa.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, including the generalized net-like erythema and stroke, are consistent with Ataxia-Telangiectasia (Louis-Bar syndrome). This is a rare genetic disorder that affects the brain and nervous system, leading to progressive cerebellar ataxia, oculocutaneous telangiectasia, and immunodeficiency. The patient's history of multiple strokes and Raynaud syndrome also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the negative results of previous workups, including antiphospholipid antibody and lupus anticoagulant screening, suggest that the patient does not have a thrombophilic disorder, which is consistent with Ataxia-Telangiectasia. Skin biopsy findings, such as those shown in Figure D, are also consistent with this diagnosis. Therefore, option C is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C 
Explanation: The patient's recurrent dysarthria and ataxia, along with the MRI findings of T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery changes with associated patchy enhancement in the brainstem, left frontal lobe, left cingulate gyrus, and left parietal lobe, are consistent with autoimmune encephalitis. The negative CSF viral polymerase chain reaction studies, including cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster virus, herpes simplex virus, enterovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus, and the negative CSF bacterial culture suggest that the cause is not an infection. The patient's history of previous episodes of demyelinating syndrome and response to corticosteroids also support this diagnosis. Multiple sclerosis (option A) is a possibility, but the patient's age and the absence of oligoclonal bands in the CSF argue against this diagnosis. Central nervous system lymphoma (option B) is unlikely given the absence of restricted diffusion on MRI and the negative CSF cytologic test results. Neurosarcoidosis (option D) is also unlikely given the absence of clinical and radiographic evidence of sarcoidosis.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's history of a stable red lesion since childhood, along with the recent development of new black spots, suggests a congenital nevus. However, the rapidly changing morphology of the lesion, with the appearance of skin-colored to pink thin-walled vesicles, is concerning for melanoma. The patient's family history of dysplastic nevus syndrome and melanoma in his father and paternal relatives also supports this diagnosis. Therefore, option B, Melanoma, is the most likely diagnosis.

Option A, Congenital nevus, is incorrect because while the patient does have a congenital lesion, the changing morphology and appearance of new black spots suggest a different diagnosis.

Option C, Angiokeratoma, is unlikely because it typically appears as a small, red-brown papule or plaque with a rough, sandpaper-like texture.

Option D, Mastocytoma, is also unlikely because it typically appears as a well-circumscribed, reddish-brown nodule or plaque with a smooth surface.

Answer: C 
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as a slowly enlarging mass with associated pain, and the fact that the mass is irregular and mobile, suggest that the mass is likely to be malignant. Additionally, the patient's age and lack of family history of breast or ovarian cancer make it less likely that the mass is benign. Carcinomas are malignant tumors that can arise in various tissues, including the breast. They can cause pain and can invade surrounding tissues, which is consistent with the patient's symptoms. Gynecomastia, which is the development of breast tissue in males, can also cause breast masses, but it is usually not associated with pain and does not have the same irregular, mobile characteristics as a carcinoma. Lipomas are benign fatty tumors that are usually soft and painless, and they do not have the same irregular shape as the mass described in the case. Epidermal inclusion cysts are benign growths that form when skin cells become trapped in a sac-like structure, but they are usually small and do not cause pain. Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and the characteristics of the mass, the most likely diagnosis is carcinoma.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressively worsening diffuse abdominal pain, distension, nausea, and nonbilious emesis, along with the physical examination findings of a lethargic patient with a distended abdomen, diffuse rebound tenderness, and involuntary guarding, suggest a possible small-bowel obstruction. The laboratory values of sodium concentration, lactate concentration, and white blood cell count are consistent with dehydration and systemic inflammatory response. The computed tomography (CT) scan findings of diffuse free fluid, dilated small bowel loops with thickened, hypoenhancing bowel walls, and marked edema of the mesentery support the diagnosis of mesenteric venous thrombosis (MVT). MVT is a rare cause of small-bowel ischemia, which can result in bowel wall thickening, edema, and diminished blood flow. The absence of free air on the CT scan suggests that the obstruction is not due to a perforation. The patient's history of pencil-thin stools for several months suggests a possible chronic obstruction. The lack of a prior history of abdominal operations and the patient's age also support the diagnosis of MVT. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Mesenteric venous thrombosis.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient has acute dacryocystitis with preseptal cellulitis, which suggests a possible blockage in the lacrimal drainage system. Probing with silicone intubation would help to establish a patent lacrimal drainage system and ensure that the infection is not caused by a blockage. This would be the next best step in management before considering other options such as antibiotics or surgical intervention.

In contrast, option A, transitioning to oral antibiotics and discharge, may not be appropriate at this stage as the infection may not have fully resolved and the patient may require further monitoring and treatment. Option C, performing lacrimal sac digital massage, may be considered later in the management plan but would not be the next best step at this point. Option D, conducting endoscopic nasal exploration and marsupialization, may be necessary if the infection persists or recurs, but it is not the most appropriate next step.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of bilateral optic disc edema, retinal hemorrhages, and decreased vision, along with the abnormal MRI findings, suggest the possibility of a systemic inflammatory condition affecting the central nervous system. The presence of numbness and tinnitus also support this diagnosis. Corticosteroids may be prescribed to reduce inflammation, and a consultation with rheumatology may be necessary to help manage the underlying condition. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate choice.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of blurry vision, mild optic nerve pallor, and subretinal fluid are consistent with a diagnosis of central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC). CSC is a common complication of systemic corticosteroid use, and it is likely that the patient's recent use of oral prednisone for Bell palsy has contributed to the development of this condition. Administering an intravitreal injection of an anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agent, such as ranibizumab or bevacizumab, is a common treatment for CSC and can help to resolve the subretinal fluid and improve vision. Tapering the oral prednisone, as option A suggests, may also help to resolve the symptoms, but it may take longer to see an effect, and the patient may require additional treatment if the CSC does not improve. Ordering brain neuroimaging and lumbar puncture, as option C suggests, may be necessary if the patient's symptoms do not improve with treatment or if there are concerns about a more serious underlying condition, but it is not the most appropriate next step. Ordering an infectious and inflammatory workup, as option D suggests, is not likely to be helpful in this case, as there is no evidence of infection or inflammation.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of bilateral eyelid edema, erythema, and shallow ulceration, along with the presence of pyuria, suggest a diagnosis of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, a severe adverse reaction to medication. Performing a Tzanck smear on a swab from an ulcerated lesion can help confirm the diagnosis by identifying the presence of multinucleated giant cells, a hallmark of the condition. It is important to note that corticosteroid eyedrops may not be effective in treating Stevens-Johnson syndrome and may even exacerbate the condition. Institute contact precautions and prescribing mupirocin ointment to the eyelid skin may help prevent spread of infection, but they are not directly addressing the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Echocardiography and intravenous immunoglobulin may be necessary in certain cases of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, but they are not the most appropriate next steps in this patient's management.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of acute, severe flank pain, hypotension, conjunctival pallor, and left renal angle tenderness, along with the findings of acute-onset thrombocytopenia and leukocytosis, are consistent with spontaneous perinephric hematoma. This is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication of ibrutinib therapy. The patient's history of mantle cell lymphoma and previous treatment with the Nordic protocol, which resulted in tumor lysis syndrome and neutropenic sepsis, also support this diagnosis. The absence of a history of trauma or fever and the normal coagulation profile further suggest that the bleeding is likely due to ibrutinib-related hemorrhagic complications rather than other causes. The CT scan findings of a perinephric hematoma (Figure 1A) are also consistent with this diagnosis. Therefore, option B (spontaneous perinephric hematoma) is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient has multiple systemic emboli, including pulmonary emboli and cortical infarcts, which suggest a high risk of stroke or other embolic events. Treating the patient with full-dose anticoagulation (option C) would help to prevent further embolic events and reduce the risk of stroke. Initiating broad-spectrum antibiotics (option A) may be appropriate if there is a concern about infective endocarditis, but it would not address the underlying cause of the emboli. Referring for surgical valve replacement (option B) may be necessary in the future, but it is not the most urgent step in management at this time. Initiating chemotherapy (option D) may be appropriate for the patient's lung cancer, but it would not address the immediate risk of embolic events.

Answer: B 
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and CT scan are consistent with a solitary fibrous tumor (SFT). SFTs are rare, slow-growing tumors that can arise in various parts of the body, including the nasal cavity. They are usually benign but can be locally aggressive and infiltrate surrounding tissues. The patient's symptoms of unilateral nasal obstruction and paranasal pressure are consistent with SFT's presentation. The CT scan shows complete opacification of the right paranasal sinuses with mass effect on the medial maxillary wall, which is also consistent with SFT. The histopathological findings of a uniform spindle cell tumor with bland nuclei and positive staining for S-100 and actin are also consistent with SFT. Additionally, the negative staining for GFAP, CD34, and cytokeratin helps to rule out other potential diagnoses such as a meningothelial or nasal cavity tumor. Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, imaging findings, and histopathology, the most likely diagnosis is a solitary fibrous tumor.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, along with the imaging results and histopathologic features, are consistent with histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis (HNL). HNL is a rare condition characterized by the proliferation of histiocytes and the formation of granulomatous inflammation, which can mimic a neoplastic process. The presence of Langhans-type giant cells and central necrosis in the histopathologic image is also consistent with HNL. The patient's history of asthma, chronic otitis media with effusion, and obstructive sleep apnea, as well as the absence of fevers or other constitutional symptoms, further support this diagnosis. Therefore, option C (Histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis) is the correct answer.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of worsening respiratory distress, stridor, and subcostal retractions, along with the positive viral panel for rhinovirus, suggest a diagnosis of laryngotracheitis (croup). The prolonged expiratory phase and restrictive "shark fin" waveform on capnography also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of prematurity and intubation during a neonatal intensive care unit stay may have contributed to the development of croup. Subglottic cyst (option B) and subglottic stenosis (option C) are less likely given the patient's age and symptoms. Subglottic hemangioma (option D) is a rare condition and is not supported by the patient's symptoms or examination findings. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is laryngotracheitis (croup).

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as bright red, burning, and painful nodules around the scrotum, and the physical examination findings of symmetrical solitary erythematous nodules in the right and left inguinal folds adjacent to the scrotum, are consistent with a diagnosis of cutaneous malakoplakia. Cutaneous malakoplakia is a rare condition characterized by the accumulation of macrophages in the skin, leading to the formation of papules or nodules. It can occur in various parts of the body, including the genital area. The patient's history of intertrigo and use of topical corticosteroids may have contributed to the development of cutaneous malakoplakia.

The presence of satellite lesions and the absence of regional lymph node enlargement or systemic involvement also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of treatment with high-potency topical corticosteroids without improvement suggests that the condition is not likely to be psoriasis (option A). Lupus erythematosus (option B) can cause a similar appearance, but it typically involves the face, ears, and scalp, and the patient's age and lack of other symptoms make it less likely. T-cell lymphoma (option D) is a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's age and the absence of systemic symptoms.

Explanation: Subcutaneous sarcoidosis is a rare form of sarcoidosis that affects the subcutaneous tissue. It is characterized by the formation of nodules, plaques, or infiltrates in the subcutaneous tissue, often with a sporotrichoid distribution, as seen in the patient's case. The patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and weight loss, as well as the presence of hilar lymphadenopathy on imaging, are consistent with sarcoidosis. The negative culture and histopathology results for fungal and mycobacterial organisms, as well as the absence of palpable lymphadenopathy or lower extremity lesions, make sporotrichosis less likely. Tumoral calcinosis is a rare condition characterized by the formation of calcium deposits in the soft tissues, often in association with chronic inflammation or infection. Erythema nodosum is a condition characterized by the formation of painful, erythematous nodules on the shins, often associated with sarcoidosis or other inflammatory conditions. While the patient's symptoms of shortness of breath and weight loss may be consistent with sarcoidosis, the absence of other characteristic findings of erythema nodosum, such as painful nodules on the shins, makes this diagnosis less likely.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive vision loss, night blindness, and light sensitivity, along with the physical examination findings of dry, keratinized patches on the conjunctiva (Bitot spots) and marked corneal epitheliopathy with opacity, are consistent with vitamin A deficiency. The patient's restrictive diet, which consists solely of potato, pork, lamb, apples, cucumber, and Cheerios, may have contributed to the deficiency. The absence of redness, discharge, or trauma to the eyes and the normal extraocular movements also support this diagnosis.

Glaucoma (A) is unlikely given the patient's age and the absence of pain, headache, or photopsias. Sjögren syndrome (C) may also be considered, but the patient's age and the absence of other symptoms such as dry mouth, dry eyes, and joint pain make it less likely. Bilateral cataracts (D) are not consistent with the patient's symptoms or physical examination findings.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of worsening right lower quadrant tenderness and fullness, associated with diarrhea, vomiting, fevers, and chills, are consistent with acute appendicitis. The patient's history of relief of symptoms with loperamide, which is an antidiarrheal medication, suggests that the patient's symptoms are likely due to a gastrointestinal issue rather than a systemic infection. The patient's lack of significant medical history, including no history of weight loss, melena, or hematochezia, also supports the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Additionally, the patient's leukocytosis and elevated C-reactive protein level are consistent with an inflammatory process, such as appendicitis. The CT scan findings of a large right-sided inflammatory phlegmon also support the diagnosis of acute appendicitis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is acute appendicitis, which is answer B.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient has experienced profound vision loss after a traumatic work injury, with bilateral lower extremity crush injuries, left leg degloving injury, distal femur fracture, and posterior knee dislocation. The patient's hypotension and anemia suggest significant blood loss, which could have led to hypoxia and ischemia in the brain. The patient's symptoms of bilateral vision loss and nonreactive pupils suggest a possible bilateral optic neuropathy. The fundus photographs show normal optic discs with diffuse pallor, which is consistent with optic neuropathy.

Given the patient's history and physical examination findings, it is important to counsel the patient on the prognosis of his condition. The patient's vision loss may be permanent, and it is important to set realistic expectations for recovery. It is also important to consider the patient's quality of life and potential need for rehabilitation services.

Therefore, option C, counseling the patient on the prognosis of his condition, is the most appropriate next step in management.

Option A, testing the patient with an optokinetic nystagmus drum, may be useful in assessing the patient's vestibular function, but it is not directly related to the patient's vision loss.

Option B, repeating magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, may be useful in evaluating the patient's brain function and identifying any potential intracranial causes of vision loss, but it is not the most urgent step in management.

Option D, testing pupils with dilute pilocarpine, may be useful in assessing the patient's autonomic function, but it is not directly related to the patient's vision loss.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of facial numbness and ocular pain, along with the physical examination findings of reduced sensation in the distribution of the ophthalmic and maxillary branches of the right trigeminal nerve, suggest a possible diagnosis of trigeminal neuralgia. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain would be the most appropriate next step in evaluating the patient's symptoms, as it can help to identify any abnormalities in the trigeminal nerve and its surrounding structures.

Computed tomography (CT) angiography (Option A) may be useful in evaluating the patient's facial pain, but it would not be the most appropriate next step in evaluating the patient's trigeminal neuralgia symptoms.

Prescribing analgesia (Option B) may provide some relief for the patient's pain, but it would not address the underlying cause of the symptoms.

Answer: D
Explanation: The most appropriate next step in the management of this healthy child with unilateral congenital ptosis would be to discuss carefully observing vs surgical repair of the ptosis. The patient's history of twitching of the left eye during feeding and mealtimes since infancy, along with the asymmetry in eyelid measurements and the absence of any other neurological or ophthalmic abnormalities, suggests that the ptosis may be due to a congenital anomaly. The patient's age and the presence of bilateral mixed astigmatism also support this diagnosis. Observing the patient carefully and monitoring for any changes in the ptosis over time may be sufficient, as some cases of congenital ptosis may resolve spontaneously. However, if the ptosis is severe and persistent, surgical repair may be necessary to improve the patient's visual function and cosmesis. Genetic testing (option A) may be considered in cases where there is a family history of similar anomalies or other genetic disorders, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. Urgent neuroimaging (option B) is not necessary, as there are no signs of any neurological disorder or abnormality. Oral corticosteroids (option C) are not indicated for the management of congenital ptosis.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive restrictive strabismus, blurred vision, drooping of the left upper eyelid, and binocular diplopia, along with the physical examination findings of mild proptosis and severely limited adduction of the left eye, suggest a possible orbital tumor. The MRI scan supports this diagnosis, showing a 2.3-cm intraconal mass that is inseparable from the left lateral rectus muscle and medially deviates the left optic nerve. Incisional biopsy (option C) would be the next step in management to establish the diagnosis and guide further treatment. Excisional biopsy (option A) may be considered, but given the location and size of the mass, incisional biopsy may be more appropriate. Chemotherapy (option B) would not be appropriate at this time, as there is no evidence of metastatic disease.

Answer: A
Explanation: Clonal evolution of myeloma cells to both IgG- and IgA-secreting cells is the most likely explanation for the emergence of a new M-protein in this patient's serum. The patient's original M-protein was an IgA κ, and after three weeks of therapy, a new M-protein of the same electrophoretic position but with a different immunoglobulin type (IgG κ) appeared. This suggests that the myeloma cells have undergone clonal evolution, which is a common feature of myeloma. The fact that the original M-protein is no longer detected suggests that the new M-protein has replaced it, which is consistent with clonal evolution. The other options are less likely explanations for the emergence of a new M-protein. Immune dysregulation from multiagent therapy resulting in a new M-protein (option B) is possible but less likely since the patient had already been on therapy for three weeks before the new M-protein appeared. New MGUS or B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder, such as monoclonal B lymphocytosis (option C) is unlikely since the patient had a known diagnosis of myeloma and the new M-protein has the same electrophoretic position as the original M-protein. Therapeutic monoclonal antibody at serum concentration detectable by SPEP-IF (option D) is unlikely since the patient's serum free κ/λ ratio gradually decreased over time, indicating that the M-protein is not due to therapy.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's presentation of unheralded syncope, along with the findings of bradycardia, first-degree atrioventricular block, left posterior fascicle, and right bundle branch blocks on electrocardiography, suggests a possible diagnosis of a cardiac conduction disorder. Additionally, the patient's exercise stress single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) showed transient high-grade atrioventricular block, which further supports this diagnosis. Therefore, the next step would be to order 30-day event monitoring to further evaluate the patient's cardiac rhythm and determine the frequency and duration of any arrhythmic episodes. This will help guide management decisions and ensure the patient's safety.

In contrast, invasive electrophysiologic testing (Option A) may be unnecessary at this stage, as the patient's symptoms and electrocardiography findings are consistent with a conduction disorder rather than a arrhythmia. Coronary angiography (Option B) is not indicated based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings, as there is no evidence of coronary artery disease. Cardiac fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (Option D) is also not indicated, as it is primarily used to evaluate myocardial perfusion and metabolism, and is not relevant to the patient's presenting symptoms or suspected diagnosis.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a possible diagnosis of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of the skin and lungs. The patient's rash and respiratory symptoms, along with the negative viral cultures and normal liver function tests, support this diagnosis. The patient's neutrophil recovery and lack of lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly also suggest that GVHD is more likely than an infection. A skin punch biopsy demonstrated subtle vacuolar change, rare epidermal dyskeratosis, and a superficial perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrate with occasional eosinophils, which are consistent with GVHD. Therefore, the next step would be to perform a bronchoscopy and biopsy of the pulmonary lesions to confirm the diagnosis of GVHD and assess the extent of lung involvement.

Explanation: The patient's urine drug screen reveals the presence of methadone, hydromorphone, and codeine. Methadone is a synthetic opioid that is commonly used to treat chronic pain, and it is metabolized into hydromorphone, which is also an opioid. Codeine is another opioid that is sometimes prescribed for pain relief. The patient's regimen includes methadone, immediate-release morphine, and gabapentin, which is not an opioid. Therefore, option C is the correct answer. Option A is incorrect because it does not include hydromorphone, which is a metabolite of methadone. Option B is incorrect because it does not include hydromorphone or codeine. Option D is incorrect because it includes morphine, which is not detected in the urine drug screen.

Answer: C Systemic lupus erythematosus 
Explanation: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organs, including the skin. One of the skin manifestations of SLE is a malar rash, which is characterized by flat, red, painless lesions on the cheeks, nose, and forehead. The patient's history of unintentional weight loss, mild diffuse abdominal pain, and occasional episodes of vomiting, along with the presence of numerous 5- to 10-mm nontender papules with a porcelain-white atrophic center and an erythematous halo, and scattered atrophic white scars on her trunk, neck, and upper and lower extremities, are consistent with the skin manifestations of SLE. Additionally, the patient's history of a previous episode of idiopathic bowel perforation three years prior suggests that she may have an underlying autoimmune disorder, such as SLE. The biopsy results show hyperkeratosis and wedge-shaped avascular necrosis in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue, which is consistent with the skin changes seen in SLE. Therefore, based on the patient's clinical presentation and biopsy results, the most likely diagnosis is systemic lupus erythematosus.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including tense blisters on the palms and soles, a history of polymyalgia, and negative IgG chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay for bullous pemphigoid (BP) 180 noncollagenous (NC) 16A, are consistent with anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid. This diagnosis is supported by the histopathologic analysis of a subepidermal bulla with inflammatory infiltrates of neutrophils. Additionally, the patient's response to oral prednisolone treatment, with healing of lesions without scar or milia formation, is consistent with anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid. Bullous pemphigoid (A) is a possibility, but the patient's age and lack of mucosal involvement make it less likely.

Answer: C
Explanation: Muckle-Wells syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by recurrent fevers, urticaria, and arthralgias, which are the main symptoms described in the case. The fact that the patient had fevers and urticaria since 2 months of age, and that the symptoms have been recurring almost every month, suggests a chronic condition rather than an acute infection. The absence of a malignant process on bone marrow aspiration and biopsy also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the presence of bilateral conjunctival hyperemia without drainage and the limitation of active and passive range of motion in the right ankle and knee, are consistent with the ocular and musculoskeletal manifestations of Muckle-Wells syndrome. Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (option B) is a similar condition, but it typically presents with a later onset and a more prominent cold-induced symptomatology, which is not mentioned in the case. Chronic urticaria (option A) is a broader term that encompasses many different conditions, but it does not explain the fevers, conjunctivitis, and arthralgias described in the case. Neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disorder (option D) is a severe condition that presents with fevers, rash, and multiorgan involvement, but it typically has a more severe course and would have been identified earlier in the patient's life.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of right upper extremity pain and swelling, along with the physical examination findings of tense and tender swelling, impaired motor function, and absent radial pulse, are consistent with compartment syndrome. The patient's history of attempted PICC insertion and establishment of an intravenous catheter in the left hand suggests that the compartment syndrome may be a result of infiltration of intravenous infusion therapy into the soft tissues of the upper extremity. The presence of a heterogeneous fluid collection with active color flow on duplex ultrasonographic imaging supports this diagnosis.

The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and examination findings as well. Extensive deep vein thrombosis of the upper extremity (option A) may cause swelling and pain, but it would not explain the absent radial pulse or the presence of a fluid collection. Secondary lymphedema of the upper extremity (option C) may cause swelling, but it would not explain the pain or the absent radial pulse. Brachial artery pseudoaneurysm (option D) may cause pain and swelling, but it would not explain the absent radial pulse or the presence of a fluid collection.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of upper abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, along with the physical examination findings of moderate epigastric tenderness with rebound and guarding, suggest an acute abdominal process. The laboratory test results, particularly the elevated white blood cell count and serum amylase level, support a diagnosis of pancreatitis. The contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) image shows an intra-abdominal hyperdense mass, which is consistent with a pancreatic pseudocyst or abscess. Additionally, the visceral artery angiogram reveals an aneurysm, which is likely the cause of the bleeding and pancreatitis. Therefore, the diagnosis is rupture of a jejunal artery aneurysm (C).

Answer: D
Explanation: The patient presents with acute-onset blurred vision and mild tenderness in his left eye, along with shallow anterior chamber and elevated intraocular pressure. The presence of a choroidal mass is also noted. Given these symptoms and findings, it is likely that the patient has a choroidal effusion or hemorrhage, which can cause vision loss if left untreated.

The best course of action would be to proceed with sclerotomies, which involves creating scleral windows to drain the choroidal effusion or hemorrhage and relieve the pressure on the retina. This would help to improve the patient's vision and prevent further damage to the eye.

Performing fine-needle aspiration biopsy (Option A) may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis, but it would not be the most appropriate next step in this case, as the patient's symptoms and findings are already consistent with a choroidal effusion or hemorrhage.

Plaque radiotherapy (Option B) may be considered for the treatment of choroidal melanoma, but it is not appropriate in this case, as there is no evidence of a melanoma.

Treating the patient with oral corticosteroids (Option C) may help to reduce inflammation, but it would not be effective in draining the choroidal effusion or hemorrhage, and may even worsen the patient's condition by increasing the risk of further bleeding.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of bilateral mydriasis, reduced pupillary response to light and accommodation, and progressive generalized autonomic dysfunction suggest a possible diagnosis of autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy. This is a rare condition where the immune system attacks the autonomic nervous system, leading to symptoms such as pupillary abnormalities, dry eyes, and constipation. The patient's negative serology results for ganglioside IgG antibodies associated with Fisher syndrome, a similar condition, support this diagnosis. Obtaining a blood sample to investigate for autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy is the next appropriate step in the patient's management.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's peaked pupil and pain suggest irritation or inflammation of the eye, which could be caused by a number of factors, including dry eye, conjunctivitis, or a reaction to the mitomycin C therapy. Given that the patient has a history of conjunctival melanoma and recent excision and cryotherapy, it is important to monitor the eye closely and continue administering mitomycin C as adjuvant therapy to reduce the risk of recurrence. Delaying mitomycin C therapy or obtaining an ultrasonographic biomicroscopy may not address the underlying cause of the peaked pupil and pain. Biopsying the limbal area around 9:30 may be unnecessary and potentially risky, as it is not clear that the peaked pupil is related to a new tumor. Therefore, the best course of action would be to continue administering mitomycin C and schedule a follow-up visit in 6 to 8 weeks to monitor the patient's condition and address any concerns or complications that may arise.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's bilateral inferior arcuate visual field defects are stable and have remained unchanged over a 5-year period, indicating that the cause is likely to be a remote ischemic optic neuropathy rather than a progressive condition such as glaucoma. The patient's age and lack of other symptoms also support this diagnosis. Therefore, option C, reassuring the patient that the VF loss is due to congenitally anomalous optic nerves and recommending annual evaluation to monitor VF, is the most appropriate next step. Option A, recommending daily aspirin, may also be considered, but it is not the most appropriate next step as it is not clear whether the patient has a history of cardiovascular disease or other risk factors that would warrant aspirin therapy. Option B, ordering an immediate MRI study, may be considered if there are other symptoms or signs suggestive of a central nervous system disorder, but it is not the most appropriate next step based on the information provided. Option D, performing selective laser trabeculoplasty, is not appropriate as the patient's intraocular pressure is not mentioned to be elevated, and there is no indication of glaucoma.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's presentation of chest pain and shortness of breath, along with the new ST elevations and Q waves on the electrocardiogram, suggests a possible coronary event. The fact that the patient had a recent episode of mild chest pain that radiated down his left arm and vomiting, which he did not seek medical attention for, increases the likelihood of a coronary event. Additionally, the patient's history of ischemic cardiomyopathy and recent moderate cellular rejection after a heart transplant also support the need for an emergent coronary angiogram to evaluate for possible coronary artery disease or vasculitis. An endomyocardial biopsy may also be necessary to evaluate for rejection or infection, but it is not as urgent as the coronary angiogram. Therefore, the next step would be to order an emergent coronary angiogram and endomyocardial biopsy.

Explanation: The patient's history of breast cancer, the location of the eruption, and the histopathological findings are consistent with carcinoma erysipeloides (cutaneous metastases of breast cancer). Erysipeloid plaques on the chest and back, as well as the absence of tenderness to palpation, support this diagnosis. The patient's history of radiation therapy increases the likelihood of this diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a genetic disorder that affects the growth and development of nerve tissue. The hyperpigmented macules on the patient's back and thighs are characteristic of cafe-au-lait spots, which are a common feature of NF1. The patient's age and lack of prodromal erythema or trauma also support this diagnosis. A skeletal survey is necessary to look for any bony abnormalities associated with NF1, such as scoliosis or pseudarthrosis. An ophthalmologic consultation is also necessary to rule out any associated ocular abnormalities, such as Lisch nodules or optic nerve gliomas. Administering topical antifungals (option A) would not be effective in treating NF1, and taking a more detailed drug history (option B) would not be necessary at this point in the patient's evaluation. Stroking the skin lesion (option D) is not a diagnostic or therapeutic option.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's history of hypertension and elevated serum creatinine, along with the urinalysis results, suggest proliferative glomerulonephritis. The patient's urine output, proteinuria, and red blood cell casts are all indicative of this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's lack of symptoms and normal examination results, except for elevated blood pressure, support this diagnosis. Urinary tract infection (UTI) cannot be the most likely diagnosis, as the patient has not had any symptoms of UTI, such as fever, chills, or flank pain, and the urinalysis results do not indicate UTI. Nonproliferative glomerulonephritis and hypertensive nephrosclerosis are also unlikely diagnoses, as they do not explain the patient's proteinuria and red blood cell casts. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is proliferative glomerulonephritis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's history of recurrent skin lesions limited to the axillae and groin, along with the presence of crusted and pustular plaques on the trunk, suggests a diagnosis of IgA pemphigus. The histopathological findings of suprabasilar acantholysis, as seen in the hematoxylin-eosin stain (Figure C), support this diagnosis. Additionally, the absence of active lesions in the axillae, inframammary folds, and groin at the time of presentation suggests that the patient's condition is not pemphigus foliaceus (option A), which typically affects these areas. Generalized Hailey-Hailey disease (option B) is unlikely given the patient's age and lack of family history. Pemphigus vulgaris (option D) may also be considered, but the presence of crusted and pustular plaques on the trunk and the absence of mucosal involvement argue against this diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The clinical and histopathological features described in the case are consistent with an oral melanocytic nevus. The patient's history of previous orolabial melanotic macules and the presence of cutaneous ephelides also support this diagnosis. The lesions are characterized by a diffuse proliferation of heavily pigmented dendritic melanocytes that extend the full thickness of the epithelium, with melanin incontinence noted in the mucosal epithelium. These features are typical of melanocytic nevi and distinguish them from oral melanotic macules, which are typically smaller and less pigmented. Oral malignant melanoma would be unlikely given the patient's age and the absence of any concerning clinical features, such as bleeding, pain, or rapid growth. Oral melanoacanthoma is a rare entity that typically presents as a rapidly growing, painful swelling on the lip or tongue, and is not consistent with the patient's clinical presentation.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with listeriosis. The presence of vesicles with an erythematous base on the lower back and left thigh, along with the patient's neutropenia and recent chemotherapy, suggest a diagnosis of cutaneous listeriosis. The patient's history of relapsed refractory infantile acute lymphoblastic leukemia and central nervous system involvement also increases the likelihood of listeriosis. The gram stain (Figure D) shows numerous gram-positive rods, which are consistent with Listeria monocytogenes, the bacteria that causes listeriosis. The hematoxylin-eosin stain (Figures B and C) shows a predominantly neutrophilic infiltrate, which is consistent with a bacterial infection. The patient's recent chemotherapy and neutropenia make it less likely that the rash is caused by herpes simplex virus (A) or varicella zoster virus (B). The absence of any history of recent exposure to Bacillus cereus and the patient's clinical presentation also make it less likely that the rash is caused by cutaneous Bacillus cereus infection (D). Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is cutaneous listeriosis (C).

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including intermittent limp and increasing headache, and the MRI findings of multiple parenchymal lesions involving the pons, bilateral amygdala, and the left temporal pole, are consistent with a diagnosis of primary intracranial melanoma. The fact that the lesions have evolved over a decade and have recently progressed, along with the presence of a newly developed mass in the third ventricle and obstructive hydrocephalus, also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of multiple congenital nevi distributed over the body, including two larger than 5 cm in diameter, suggests a possible association with neurocutaneous melanosis, which is a rare condition characterized by the development of melanocytic nevi in the nervous system. However, the absence of any focal motor or sensory deficits, muscle stretch reflexes, and the normal spinal cord MRI, argue against a diagnosis of metastatic melanoma (Option A). The patient's age and lack of any significant family history also make lymphoma (Option D) less likely.

The patient's symptoms of severe pain, swelling, and purpura at the site of injection, as well as the physical examination findings of retiform purpura and diminished sensation in the affected area, are consistent with Nicolau syndrome. The patient's age and the fact that the symptoms worsened over time also support this diagnosis. Pyomyositis (A) is a possible diagnosis, but it is less likely given the absence of fever, chills, and muscle swelling. Retained foreign body (C) is unlikely since the patient did not receive any recent surgical or medical procedures. Necrotizing fasciitis (D) is a severe condition that can cause skin necrosis, but it is unlikely in this case since the patient does not have signs of systemic inflammation or sepsis.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of right lower quadrant abdominal pain, anorexia, nonbloody nonbilious emesis, voluntary guarding, and focal tenderness to palpation, along with the absence of fever or chills, are consistent with Meckel diverticulitis. The patient's history of prematurity and the presence of a retrocecal mass on CT scan also support this diagnosis. Meckel diverticulitis is a rare condition that occurs when there is inflammation of a Meckel diverticulum, a vestigial structure that is present in about 2% of the population. It can cause symptoms similar to appendicitis, but the location of the pain is usually more lateral and not as severe. The patient's age and the presence of a retrocecal mass are also consistent with Meckel diverticulitis. Perforated appendicitis (A) is unlikely given the absence of fever, chills, and the presence of a retrocecal mass. Crohn disease (C) is also unlikely given the patient's age and the absence of other symptoms. Ectopic ovarian torsion (D) is not supported by the patient's symptoms or imaging findings.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of acute neck swelling and chest pain, along with the physical examination findings of soft tissue swelling over the left supraclavicular area and the laboratory data of leukocytosis, are consistent with a contained esophageal perforation. The computed tomographic scan findings of extensive edema of the left neck, with fat stranding seen in the subcutaneous tissues extending into the left jugular, carotid, and esophageal spaces, support this diagnosis. Additionally, the absence of overlying skin changes or crepitus and the lack of extravasation of contrast on the barium swallow also suggest a contained esophageal perforation. Therefore, option C is the most likely diagnosis.

The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and examination findings as well. Option A, acute jugular thrombosis, does not explain the patient's chest pain or the computed tomographic scan findings of mediastinal edema and bilateral pleural effusions. Option B, spontaneous chylothorax, is unlikely given the patient's history of forceful coughing and the absence of any recent trauma to the neck or chest. Option D, descending necrotizing mediastinitis, is a severe and life-threatening condition that typically presents with fever, chest pain, and difficulty swallowing, and is often caused by a bacterial infection. While the patient's symptoms of chest pain and swelling of the left side of her neck may be consistent with this diagnosis, the absence of fever and the patient's recent history of viral illness make it less likely.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of blurred vision, disc edema, intraretinal hemorrhages, and extensive sheathing of retinal venules suggest a diagnosis of uveitis, which is an inflammatory condition affecting the eye. The presence of aseptic meningitis and unilateral blurred vision suggests a possible diagnosis of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease, a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the eye and the central nervous system. VKH disease is associated with aseptic meningitis and uveitis, and it is important to evaluate the patient for this condition to provide appropriate treatment. Therefore, the next step would be to evaluate the patient for systemic infectious disease, which is option C. This would involve a thorough history and physical examination, as well as laboratory tests to rule out other potential causes of aseptic meningitis and uveitis. Imaging studies, such as MRI or CT scans, may also be ordered to evaluate the extent of inflammation in the central nervous system. Once the diagnosis of VKH disease is confirmed, treatment with systemic corticosteroids (option A) may be considered to reduce inflammation and prevent further damage to the eye and central nervous system. Intraocular corticosteroid injection (option B) may also be considered to treat the uveitis, but this would be less effective in treating the underlying autoimmune disorder. Intravenous acyclovir (option D) would not be effective in treating VKH disease, as it is used to treat herpes simplex virus infections.

Answer: B: Explore, irrigate, and close the wound
Explanation: The patient's history is unknown, and there is a possibility of a nasolacrimal duct injury. It is crucial to explore and irrigate the wound to rule out any other potential injuries, such as a lacrimal gland or orbital fracture. Closing the wound will help prevent further fluid leakage and promote healing. Option A is incorrect because nasolacrimal duct irrigation may not be effective in identifying a nasolacrimal duct injury, and it may push any debris or bacteria further into the duct. Option C is not necessary at this point, as the patient's condition is stable, and a CT scan may not provide adequate information about the nasolacrimal system. Option D is also not necessary, as MRI is not typically used to evaluate facial trauma or nasolacrimal duct injuries.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and findings, including persistent blurry vision, mild corneal edema, and retinal whitening with intraretinal hemorrhages, are concerning for a possible retinal detachment or inflammatory condition. A dilated fundus examination revealed multiple spots of retinal whitening with tiny intraretinal hemorrhages concentrated in the posterior pole. Optical coherence tomography showed intraretinal cystoid abnormalities in the macula and hyperreflective patches in the nerve fiber layer and inner nuclear layer. These findings suggest a possible diagnosis of retinal vasculitis or uveitis, which can cause retinal whitening and hemorrhages.

Therefore, the next step would be to perform a vitreous tap and injection of foscarnet, which is a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure to evaluate and treat possible retinal infections or inflammations. This procedure can help to confirm the diagnosis and provide prompt treatment to prevent further damage to the retina.

Starting systemic steroids (option A) may be considered, but it is not the most appropriate next step, as the patient's symptoms and findings suggest a possible retinal detachment or inflammatory condition that requires prompt intervention. Obtaining more information on the patient's history (option B) may be helpful, but it is not the most urgent step in this situation. Infectious and autoimmune workup (option D) may be considered, but it is not the most appropriate next step, as the patient's symptoms and findings suggest a possible retinal detachment or inflammatory condition that requires prompt intervention.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of generalized weakness and fatigue, along with the recent fall, suggest that the patient may be experiencing symptoms of bradycardia. The electrocardiogram (ECG) shows a prolonged PR interval, which is consistent with a prolonged AV delay. Increasing the postventricular atrial refractory period (PVARP) to 250 milliseconds would allow for more time for the atria to recover and potentially capture a sinus beat, which could help alleviate symptoms of bradycardia.

Increasing the atrial pacing rate to 70 beats per minute (Option A) may not address the underlying bradycardia and could potentially lead to pacemaker-mediated tachycardia. Shortening the programmed AV delay to 150 milliseconds (Option B) may not be appropriate given the patient's symptoms and ECG findings. Referring the patient for pacemaker lead revision (Option D) may be necessary if other interventions are unsuccessful, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management.

Answer: C
Explanation: Plasmacytoma is a type of plasma cell tumor that can occur in patients with multiple myeloma. The patient's history of IgGκ multiple myeloma and the presence of painful cutaneous nodules that are round, fixed, and firm to touch, are consistent with plasmacytoma. The fact that the patient had completed 4 cycles of RVD therapy and irradiation for lytic lesions of the thoracic and lumbar spine, without any evidence of end-organ disease, also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the immunohistochemical analysis of the largest lesion on the patient's right shoulder, which showed a κ-restricted plasma cell population positive for CD38 and CD138 but negative for CD3, CD20, and CD45 expression, is consistent with plasmacytoma.

Hemangioma (A) is a benign tumor of blood vessels that can occur in various parts of the body, including the skin. However, it is not associated with multiple myeloma.

Neutrophilic dermatoses (B) are a group of skin disorders characterized by the infiltration of neutrophils into the skin. While they can be associated with hematological malignancies, they are not typically associated with multiple myeloma.

Leukemia cutis (D) is a rare condition characterized by the infiltration of leukemic cells into the skin. It can occur in patients with various types of leukemia, including myeloma. However, in this case, the patient's history of multiple myeloma and the absence of any other signs of leukemia cutis, such as skin infiltrates or lymphadenopathy, make this diagnosis less likely.

Answer: A
Explanation: The most appropriate next step in the management of this patient would be to obtain a biopsy for hematoxylin-eosin stain. This is because the patient presents with a pink nodule on his left cheek that has been gradually increasing in size and has central erosions. The pruritic and sometimes bleeding nature of the lesion, along with its symmetrical shape and well-circumscribed borders, suggests that it may be a benign tumor such as a pyogenic granuloma. A biopsy would help to confirm this diagnosis and guide further management. Obtaining a biopsy for fungal culture (option B) may also be considered, but it is less likely to provide a definitive diagnosis in this case, as the lesion does not have the characteristic appearance of a fungal infection. Treating with cryotherapy (option C) or pulsed dye laser therapy (option D) without a definitive diagnosis would not be appropriate, as these treatments may not effectively manage the underlying condition and may potentially cause harm to the patient.

Therefore, it is recommended to repeat the tests in 12 weeks to confirm the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome, as option B states. Option A is incorrect because the results are not sufficient to diagnose antiphospholipid syndrome without confirmation by repeat testing.

The presence of discrete subcorneal intercellular IgA depositions, as shown by direct immunofluorescence with FITC-labeled antihuman IgA antibodies, further supports this diagnosis. IgA pemphigus is a rare autoimmune bullous disease characterized by the presence of IgA antibodies in the skin, leading to the formation of blisters and pustules.

Answer: C
Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with pseudomonal ecthyma gangrenosum. The patient has a history of recent vaccination and has a painful lesion at the site of the adhesive bandage, which is a common location for pseudomonal infections. The patient's low white blood cell and neutrophil counts suggest immunosuppression, which increases the risk of pseudomonal infections. The negative blood culture findings and absence of Aspergillus on histopathologic analysis support the diagnosis of pseudomonal ecthyma gangrenosum over Aspergillosis. The presence of broad nonseptate hyphae surrounding and infiltrating dermal blood vessels, as well as round terminal sporangia and free spores, are consistent with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the causative organism of pseudomonal ecthyma gangrenosum. Mucormycosis typically presents with black, necrotic plaques and is associated with angioinvasion, which is not seen in this case.

Answer: B 
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as a sudden, diffuse, and painful enlargement of the upper quadrants of the left breast with edema and palpable axillary lymph nodes, are consistent with tuberculous mastitis. The patient's history of recent pneumonia and negative tests for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, human immunodeficiency virus enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and whole-blood interferon γ release assay (QuantiFERON) suggest that tuberculosis is a likely diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's breast ultrasonography revealing hypoechogenicity of the breast tissue with periductal small cysts and mammography showing asymmetric density and distortion in the left upper quadrants are also consistent with tuberculous mastitis. The patient's negative history of drug addiction or hyaluronic acid or free silicone injections in the breast and absence of nipple discharge or retraction also support this diagnosis. Therefore, option B, Tuberculous mastitis, is the most likely diagnosis.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as decreased appetite and elevated plasma-free metanephrine levels, suggest the possibility of a pheochromocytoma. Additionally, the imaging findings of a hypervascular retroperitoneal mass with dilated tortuous supply from a lumbar artery branch and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy are consistent with pheochromocytoma. The fact that preoperative arterial embolization was deemed appropriate to minimize intraoperative blood loss also supports this diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient presents with a bilateral retinal problem, with symptoms of blurring vision and abnormal fundus examination findings, including poor foveal light reflex, irregular-shaped area of red discoloration in the fovea, and surrounding subtle flecking of the retina. The patient has a history of Alport syndrome, which is a genetic disorder that affects the kidneys, eyes, and inner ear. The patient's ocular history is unremarkable, and there are no other abnormalities on ophthalmoscopic examination. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography shows an irregular foveal contour with trace epiretinal membrane formation, but no evidence of foveoschisis or outer retinal changes. Given the patient's history of Alport syndrome and the bilateral nature of the retinal problem, it is likely that the patient has a retinal degeneration associated with the syndrome. Observing and repeating spectral-domain optical coherence tomography in 6 months to 1 year would be the most appropriate next step, as it would allow for monitoring of any changes in the retina and detection of any potential progression of the degeneration. Performing pars plana vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane peeling or aqueous/vitreous tap for viral polymerase chain reaction and injecting foscarnet intravitreally would not be appropriate, as there is no evidence of a retinal detachment or vitreous hemorrhage, and the patient's symptoms and examination findings do not suggest a viral etiology. Intravitreal injection of ocriplasmin would also not be appropriate, as it is used to treat vitreomacular traction and there is no evidence of this condition in the patient.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of a "cloudy spot" in her vision, along with the physical examination findings of a small paracentral relative scotoma and retinal whitening, suggest a possible diagnosis of a retinal vasculitis. The patient's history of jaw pain and weight loss suggest a possible association with giant cell arteritis (GCA), a condition that can cause retinal vasculitis. The patient's age and smoking history also increase her risk for GCA.

Therefore, the next step would be to perform diagnostic vitreous paracentesis and intravitreal antibiotic injection to treat the possible retinal vasculitis and GCA. This is the most appropriate answer among the given options.

Option A, observing and recommending smoking cessation, is not a sufficient next step given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

Option B, obtaining a hypercoagulable laboratory workup, may be relevant if the patient had a history of thrombotic events or other risk factors for hypercoagulability, but it is not the most appropriate next step based on the patient's current symptoms and examination findings.

Option D, starting systemic corticosteroids and biopsy the superficial temporal artery, may be considered if the patient's symptoms persist or worsen despite treatment with antibiotics, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this time.

Answer: D
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of intermittent shooting pain in the right eye, along with the physical examination findings of a circumscribed elevation of the right iris inferotemporally, suggest the possibility of a ciliary lesion. The ultrasound biomicroscopy results, which showed a circumscribed ciliary lesion with overlying closure of the iridocorneal angle, support this diagnosis. Attempting lesion rupture with neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet laser would be the next appropriate step in management, as it has been shown to be effective in treating ciliary lesions. Observing and repeating imaging in 6 months (option A) may not be sufficient to address the patient's symptoms and may allow the lesion to progress. Lesion biopsy (option B) may be necessary if the lesion does not respond to laser treatment or if there is uncertainty regarding the diagnosis, but it is not the most appropriate next step. Systemic workup for occult malignancy (option C) is not indicated based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's bradycardia is likely due to autonomic dysfunction caused by the severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) affecting the nervous system. This is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate intervention. Placing an emergent transvenous temporary pacemaker will help regulate the patient's heart rhythm and prevent further complications such as heart failure or cardiac arrest. Observation and continuation of treatment for GVHD (option B) may not address the immediate risk of bradycardia, and placing a dual chamber pacemaker (option A) may not be necessary at this time, given the patient's young age and otherwise healthy cardiovascular system. Transcutaneous pacing (option D) may not be effective in this case due to the patient's severe bradycardia and need for immediate intervention.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive nocturnal dyspnea, dysphonia, dysphagia, and noisy breathing, along with the physical examination findings of a large, well-mucosalized mass emanating from the left pyriform sinus and mass effect on the larynx, are consistent with a diagnosis of a hypopharyngeal mass. The patient's history of obstructive sleep apnea and gastroesophageal reflux disease with Barrett esophagitis may also contribute to the patient's symptoms. The microscopic examination of the mass, which demonstrated polygonal cells with peripherally placed nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm containing cross-striations, is consistent with a diagnosis of paraganglioma. Paragangliomas are rare tumors that originate from the paraganglia, which are clusters of cells located near the sympathetic ganglia. They can occur in various parts of the body, including the head and neck, and can cause a variety of symptoms depending on their location and size. In this case, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, along with the microscopic examination of the mass, support a diagnosis of paraganglioma. Therefore, option C (Paraganglioma) is the correct answer.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as the painful eruption on the scalp, face, and left leg, are consistent with leukemia cutis. The patient's history of neutropenia and recent scratches from his pet cat suggest that the eruption may be caused by bacterial infection. The patient's AML diagnosis and cytogenetic findings, including a 5q deletion and p53 mutation, also support this diagnosis. The brisk neutrophilic infiltrate seen on histopathology further supports the diagnosis of leukemia cutis. Fusarium species infection and Bartonella henselae infection can also cause skin lesions, but they are less likely given the patient's history and laboratory results. Sweet syndrome is a skin condition characterized by fever, skin lesions, and a neutrophilic infiltrate, but it is typically associated with a different set of underlying conditions, such as infections, autoimmune disorders, or malignancies, and is less likely to be caused by AML. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is leukemia cutis.

Answer: C 
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, as reported in the clinical case, indicate that they have depressive symptoms of at least moderate severity. The patient's history of major depressive disorder and recent exacerbation of symptoms following the death of their husband also support this diagnosis. The PHQ-9 score of 16 further supports this diagnosis, as it indicates a moderate to severe level of depressive symptoms. Therefore, option C is the correct answer. Option A is incorrect because it does not take into account the patient's history of depression and the recent exacerbation of symptoms. Option B is also incorrect because dysthymic disorder is a chronic, low-grade depressive disorder that does not necessarily have the same level of severity as major depressive disorder. Option D is not relevant to the patient's current symptoms and diagnosis.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of widespread, erythematous, purpuric macules and papules on the abdomen and extremities, along with the histopathological findings of leukocytoclastic vasculitis, suggests a diagnosis of cutaneous vasculitis. The patient's history of chronic hepatitis B infection and recent initiation of tenofovir suggests that the vasculitis may be drug-induced. Therefore, it would be appropriate to evaluate the patient for systemic vasculitis, which could potentially involve other organs and cause serious complications. This would include a thorough medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests to assess for signs of systemic inflammation, such as elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Imaging studies, such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), may also be considered to evaluate for potential organ involvement. Additionally, consultation with a specialist, such as a rheumatologist or dermatologist, may be helpful in managing the patient's condition.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including polyuria, polydipsia, and nocturia, along with the appearance of yellow-brown and red-brown papules on the skin, are consistent with xanthoma disseminatum. This is a rare condition characterized by the widespread development of xanthomas, which are benign growths of histiocytes. The histopathological examination of the shave biopsy samples (Figure, C and D) shows features consistent with xanthoma disseminatum, including the presence of foam cells and Touton giant cells. Additionally, the patient's age and lack of notable medical or family history also support this diagnosis. Xanthogranuloma (option A) is a benign tumor that typically affects the skin and subcutaneous tissue, but it does not have the same widespread distribution as xanthoma disseminatum. Erdheim-Chester disease (option B) is a rare condition characterized by the proliferation of histiocytes and is often associated with systemic symptoms, but it typically affects the skin and subcutaneous tissue, and does not have the same widespread distribution as xanthoma disseminatum. Generalized eruptive histiocytoma (option D) is a rare condition characterized by the widespread development of histiocytic infiltrates in the skin, but it typically does not have the same yellow-brown and red-brown color as seen in xanthoma disseminatum.

Answer: C
Explanation: A biopsy of the lesion would be the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's conjunctival lesion. The patient's history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and extensive graft-vs-host disease, including ocular manifestations, suggests that the lesion may be related to these conditions. The presence of vascular and papilliform elements in the lesion, as well as the absence of any other obvious causes of conjunctival lesions, supports the suspicion of a graft-vs-host disease-related conjunctival lesion. A biopsy would allow for a definitive diagnosis and guide further management. While time-domain anterior segment optical coherence tomography (Option A) may be useful in evaluating the anterior segment, it would not provide a definitive diagnosis of the conjunctival lesion. Observation (Option B) may be appropriate for some conjunctival lesions, but given the patient's history and the presence of vascular and papilliform elements, a biopsy is a more appropriate next step. Obtaining a culture of the lesion (Option D) may be considered if there is concern for infection, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with acute macular neuroretinopathy (AMN), a rare condition characterized by bilateral, acute-onset, progressive vision loss and central scotomas, with distinctive fundus lesions. The patient's history of smoking and immigration from a Middle Eastern country increases the likelihood of AMN. The patient's age and absence of systemic symptoms also support this diagnosis. Oral corticosteroid therapy has been shown to improve visual outcomes in patients with AMN, likely by reducing inflammation and promoting retinal recovery. While intravitreal anti-VEGF injections may be beneficial in some cases of retinal vascular disease, they are not typically used to treat AMN. Multivitamin supplementation may be beneficial for overall health, but it is not specifically indicated for the treatment of AMN. Observation for spontaneous resolution may be appropriate for some cases of AMN, but given the severity of the patient's symptoms and the potential for further vision loss, it is not the best course of action at this time. Therefore, discussing the potential risks and benefits of initiating oral corticosteroid therapy is the most appropriate next step in management.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of intermittent facial tingling, pulsatile tinnitus, acute-onset worsening blurry vision, altered color perception, and paracentral scotomas in both eyes, along with the physical examination findings of mild optic disc edema and hyperemia, large, pale-yellowish, placoid lesions within the macula of both eyes, and extensive disruption of the ellipsoid and interdigitation zones on optical coherence tomography, are consistent with a diagnosis of syphilitic retinitis. The patient's history of multiple sexual partners and lack of any other ocular or medical history that could explain the symptoms and examination findings also support this diagnosis. Therefore, the next step would be to perform rapid plasma reagin and confirmatory fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption testing to confirm the diagnosis of syphilis. Starting oral corticosteroids (option B) would not be appropriate at this time, as the patient does not have any signs of inflammation or uveitis. Performing intravitreous tap and antiviral injection (option C) would also not be appropriate, as there is no evidence of a viral etiology for the patient's symptoms and examination findings. Observing the patient (option D) would not be appropriate, as the patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with a treatable condition, and delaying treatment could result in further vision loss.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient presents with Wide Complex Tachycardia (WCT), a condition that requires immediate attention and management to prevent further complications. The history of chest pain and dyspnea suggests a possible cardiac etiology, and the electrocardiogram (ECG) shows a single narrow QRS complex, which indicates a ventricular tachycardia. Performing direct current cardioversion followed by coronary angiography is the appropriate next step in management. Cardioversion will help restore a normal heart rhythm, and coronary angiography will help identify any underlying coronary artery disease that may have contributed to the development of the arrhythmia.

The other options are not appropriate for the following reasons:

* Option B, giving amiodarone for treatment of ventricular tachycardia, may not be effective in converting the rhythm back to normal sinus rhythm, as the QRS complex is narrow and suggests a supraventricular arrhythmia.
* Option C, giving procainamide for treatment of preexcited atrial fibrillation, is not appropriate as the ECG does not show any signs of atrial fibrillation.
* Option D, giving adenosine for treatment of supraventricular tachycardia, may not be effective in converting the rhythm back to normal sinus rhythm, as the QRS complex is wide and suggests a ventricular tachycardia.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's 24-hour urine calcium level is elevated at 250 mg/day, which suggests hypercalciuria. The patient's history of recurrent nephrolithiasis and the absence of other significant medical conditions or dietary factors that could contribute to hypercalciuria support this diagnosis. The patient's high urine calcium level is likely due to distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA), a condition in which the kidneys are unable to properly regulate acid levels in the body, leading to an excess of calcium in the urine. This diagnosis is further supported by the patient's normal serum levels of calcium, phosphorus, and parathyroid hormone, which suggest that the hypercalciuria is not due to a systemic calcium imbalance. Therefore, answer A, "The patient has hypercalciuria due to distal renal tubular acidosis," is the correct answer.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of jaw pain and signs of an upper respiratory tract infection, along with the physical examination findings of a diffusely swollen and firm parotid gland, are consistent with viral parotitis. The patient's history of recurrent acute otitis media necessitating tympanostomy tube placement further supports this diagnosis. The patient's age and the location of the mass in the anterior parotid gland also favor this diagnosis. The MRI findings of a well-defined, hyperintense mass with strong contrast enhancement and a central focal area of hypointensity are consistent with an inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor. The histopathologic findings of spindle cells with elongated nuclei in a storiform pattern embedded in a moderately dense admixed lymphohistiocytic infiltrate, along with the positive immunohistochemical staining for activin-like kinase-1 (Alk-1), vimentin, CD68, and factor XIIIa, support this diagnosis. The patient's age and the absence of atypia also support this diagnosis. Nodular fasciitis, spindle cell carcinoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's age, clinical presentation, and histopathologic findings. Therefore, the correct answer is B, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor.

Explanation: The patient's history of HIV/AIDS and the presence of a violaceous, vascular-appearing lesion involving the left maxillary gingiva, as well as the histologic analysis and immunophenotype of the specimen, are consistent with a diagnosis of plasmablastic lymphoma. This type of lymphoma is known to occur in HIV-infected individuals and is characterized by a dual population of lymphoma cells with plasmablasts and "plasmacytic" cells. The strong positive immunohistochemical expression of CD138 and Epstein-Barr virus–encoded small nuclear RNA (EBV-EBER) and the high Ki-67 index also support this diagnosis. The patient's history of varicella zoster encephalitis and cytomegalovirus retinitis, as well as the presence of a mass arising from the left maxilla and extending into the left maxillary sinus, also support this diagnosis. Therefore, option C (Plasmablastic lymphoma) is the most appropriate answer.

The presence of a painless lump in the left supraclavicular region, along with the imaging findings of a poorly circumscribed, heterogeneous, and cystic mass near the sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM), are consistent with this diagnosis. The fact that the mass was attached to the medial side of the origin of the left SCM and that there were no extensive adhesions observed during surgery also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the pathological examination revealed a combination of squamous epithelial and spindle cells, with a mature adipose tissue component, which is consistent with the histological features of ectopic hamartomatous thymoma. Finally, the immunohistochemical analysis showing diffuse positivity for cytokeratin AE1/AE3 in the epithelial component further supports this diagnosis.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of unilateral nasal congestion and intermittent epistaxis, along with the findings of a dark, soft-tissue mass on endoscopic examination and opacification of the right nasal cavity on CT scan, are consistent with a sinonasal mucosal melanoma. The histopathologic findings of sheets of atypical, pleomorphic epithelioid cells, some with prominent pigment, are also consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the positive immunohistochemical stains for HMB-45 and S-100 support this diagnosis. Leiomyosarcoma (A) is a type of soft tissue sarcoma that can occur in the nasal cavity, but it is less likely given the patient's symptoms and histopathologic findings. Olfactory neuroblastoma (B) is a rare tumor that can occur in the nasal cavity, but it typically presents with symptoms of nasal obstruction, bleeding, and pain, and the histopathologic findings are different from those described in this case.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest a diagnosis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). This is supported by the presence of ecchymoses and epistaxis, which are common symptoms of APL, as well as the abnormal white blood cell count, which shows a high percentage of blasts. The peripheral blood smear also shows a characteristic "hairy" appearance, which is consistent with APL. In this case, it would be appropriate to perform a bone marrow biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible causes of APL-like symptoms. Administering all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or chemotherapy (cytarabine and daunorubicin) without a definitive diagnosis would not be appropriate. Placing a central venous catheter would not be necessary at this point, as the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not suggest a need for immediate blood product replacement. Therefore, the best answer is C: Perform a bone marrow biopsy.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as a soft-tissue mass on the upper maxillary gingiva that is increasing in size, bleeds when brushing teeth or eating sharp foods, and is not painful, suggest a possible diagnosis of a pyogenic granuloma. Pyogenic granulomas are common benign growths that can occur in the oral cavity, particularly in pregnant women. They are usually red, pedunculated, and covered with a thin white film, which matches the patient's description. Therefore, option C, referring to an oral surgeon for excision, would be the most appropriate next step. This would allow for a definitive diagnosis and removal of the mass to alleviate the patient's symptoms and prevent any potential complications during pregnancy.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are normal, and the tumor shows a low washout rate on CT scan, which suggests a high likelihood of malignancy. A repeat CT scan in 3-6 months would be appropriate to assess any changes in the tumor size or characteristics, which would help guide further management decisions. Biopsy (option A) may not be necessary given the patient's normal laboratory results and the low washout rate on CT scan, which suggests a high likelihood of malignancy. Surgical consult (option C) may be considered later if the repeat CT scan shows significant changes in the tumor, but it is not the next step at this point. Adrenal magnetic resonance imaging (option D) may be considered if there is a concern about the diagnosis, but it is not as urgent as a repeat CT scan.

Answer: C. Septic emboli.
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of encephalopathy, recent falls, leukocytosis, nausea, and arthralgias, along with the cutaneous eruption and palpable purpura, are consistent with septic emboli. The presence of petechiae and hemorrhagic vesicles, particularly on the hands and feet, and the enlarging bulla on the left wrist, also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of recent falls and the presence of an abrasion on his left elbow suggest a possible source of bacteremia. The negative results of the stroke workup, including TEE, also argue against a diagnosis of rat bite fever or Rocky mountain spotted fever, which would be unlikely to cause such cutaneous manifestations. Disseminated gonococcemia is also unlikely given the patient's age and lack of genital symptoms.

Answer: A. Papillary/exophytic squamous cell carcinoma.
Explanation:
The given clinical case describes a 1-cm, nontender, exophytic, verrucous, skin-colored plaque on the right nasal vestibule that has been growing for about 1 year, with bleeding but no obstruction of breathing. The patient has no history of smoking or chronic rhinosinusitis. The histopathology results show papillary fronds with slender fibrovascular cores lined by nonkeratinizing squamous epithelium, as well as mucin-containing goblet cells, but no cytologic atypia or atypical mitotic figures.

Given these findings, the most likely diagnosis is papillary/exophytic squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). This type of cancer typically presents as a slow-growing, exophytic mass, often with surface ulceration or bleeding, and can occur in various locations, including the nasal cavity. The absence of cytologic atypia or atypical mitotic figures suggests a well-differentiated SCC, which is consistent with the patient's age and the relatively small size of the lesion.

Verruca vulgaris (option B) is a type of wart that can occur on the nasal skin, but it typically appears as a rough, scaly, or crusted lesion, rather than a smooth, verrucous plaque. Rhinoscleroma (option C) is a rare, chronic inflammatory disease that can cause nasal polyps, but it typically presents with nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, and epistaxis, and the histopathology results would show a different pattern of inflammation and tissue damage. Exophytic Schneiderian papilloma (option D) is a rare benign tumor that can occur in the nasal cavity, but it typically has a more polypoid or pedunculated shape, and the histopathology results would show a different pattern of epithelial proliferation and cytology.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as crusted papules and pustules on the leg, and the sporotrichoid spread of the lesions, are consistent with a diagnosis of sporotrichosis. The fact that the patient had been wading in a freshwater lake and had an abrasion on her leg before the onset of symptoms also supports this diagnosis. Sporotrichosis is a fungal infection caused by Sporothrix schenckii, which is commonly found in freshwater environments. The patient's failure to respond to previous treatments for allergic contact dermatitis and cellulitis, as well as the presence of a palpable enlarged lymph node in the left groin, also suggest that the infection has spread beyond the skin and into the lymphatic system. The potassium hydroxide scraping (Figure, C) and punch biopsies for histopathologic analysis and fungal, bacterial, and atypical mycobacterial tissue cultures that were performed support the diagnosis of sporotrichosis. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

Answer: B: Pustular psoriasis.
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as the symmetrical eruption of erythematous, edematous, annular plaques with superimposed small pustules at the periphery, and associated desquamation, are consistent with pustular psoriasis. The patient's history of atopic dermatitis and the absence of ocular or mucosal involvement also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the biopsy findings of subcorneal pustule with underlying neutrophilic spongiosis, psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia, and rare individually necrotic keratinocytes are consistent with pustular psoriasis.

The other options are less likely diagnoses for the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) typically presents with fever and widespread, small, non-follicular pustules on a background of erythema, and is often associated with medication use, which is not the case for this patient. Deficiency of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist is a rare genetic disorder that can present with pustulosis, but the patient's age and lack of family history make it less likely. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome is typically associated with fever, skin tenderness, and widespread blisters, and is caused by a bacterial infection, which is not consistent with the patient's presentation.

The patient's history of smoking and obstructive sleep apnea may also increase the risk of developing a Brown tumor. The patient's age and lack of family history of malignancy also support this diagnosis. Giant cell tumor (option A) and giant cell reparative granuloma (option B) are less likely diagnoses given the patient's age and lack of history of trauma or infection. Metastatic lytic bone lesions of unknown primary (option D) is also less likely given the patient's age and lack of history of malignancy.

Answer: C
Explanation:
The correct diagnosis is C, a recurrent herpetic whitlow. A herpetic whitlow is a viral infection of the finger caused by the herpes simplex virus, which can recur at the same site. The patient's symptoms of a soft tissue abscess and painful vesicle on the index finger, as well as the recurrence of the lesion, are consistent with a herpetic whitlow. The fact that both the patient and the surgeon were negative for human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis B/C virus testing supports this diagnosis, as herpetic whitlow is not associated with these viruses. The failure of antibiotic therapy and the lack of bacterial growth on bacteriological samples also support this diagnosis, as herpetic whitlow is a viral infection and not a bacterial infection.

The other options are not consistent with the patient's symptoms and clinical findings. Option A, a foreign body reaction, is not likely given the absence of a foreign body and the presence of a viral infection. Option B, osteitis, is not consistent with the patient's symptoms of a soft tissue abscess and painful vesicle, as osteitis is an inflammation of the bone. Option D, bacterial cellulitis, is not consistent with the lack of bacterial growth on bacteriological samples and the failure of antibiotic therapy.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's bilateral decreased vision during pregnancy, along with the fundus findings of bilateral hyperemic discs, macular edema, subretinal fluid, and flame-shaped hemorrhages, suggest a possible diagnosis of preeclampsia-related retinopathy. Preeclampsia is a pregnancy-related condition characterized by high blood pressure and damage to organs such as the kidneys and liver. Retinopathy is a common complication of preeclampsia, and it is important to diagnose and treat it promptly to prevent vision loss.

Given the patient's medical history of type 2 diabetes and the presence of macular edema, it is also possible that the patient has diabetic retinopathy. However, the presence of flame-shaped hemorrhages and subretinal fluid suggests that preeclampsia-related retinopathy is the more likely diagnosis.

Therefore, the next step would be to refer the patient to a hematology service for possible anticoagulation, as well as to closely monitor the patient's condition and perform regular follow-up examinations to ensure that the retinopathy does not progress and cause further vision loss.

Performing an intravitreous injection of an antivascular endothelial growth factor (Option A) may be considered as a treatment option for diabetic retinopathy, but it is not the most appropriate step in this case given the patient's history and clinical findings. Observing the patient (Option C) without further evaluation and treatment may not be sufficient to address the patient's condition, and performing panretinal photocoagulation in both eyes (Option D) may be considered later as a treatment option, but it is not the most appropriate step at this point in the patient's care.

Answer: B
Explanation: A mucocele is a benign tumor that arises from the nasal cavity or paranasal sinuses. It is typically slow-growing and can cause symptoms such as nasal congestion, headaches, and facial pain. The patient's symptoms of worsening blurry vision and gait instability, along with the location of the mass in the sphenoid sinus, are consistent with a mucocele. The fact that the mass did not enhance with gadolinium and was hyperintense on T2-weighted images also supports this diagnosis. Cholesterol granuloma (A) is a type of inflammatory lesion that can occur in the sphenoid sinus, but it is typically associated with a history of chronic sinusitis, which is not mentioned in the case. Chondrosarcoma (C) is a type of malignant bone tumor that can occur in the skull, but it is rare and typically has a different imaging appearance. Chordoma (D) is a type of malignant tumor that can occur in the skull base, but it typically has a more aggressive imaging appearance and is not consistent with the patient's symptoms or imaging findings.

Answer: B 
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of unilateral hearing loss, aural fullness, and otorrhea, along with the physical examination findings of a hypomobile left tympanic membrane and a plugged PET, suggest a middle ear process. The CT scan findings of near-complete opacification of the left mastoid air cells and middle ear suggest mastoiditis or chronic suppurative otitis media. The histopathological findings of small, basophilic cells that are CD20 positive and CD3 negative support the diagnosis of extramedullary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (EMCLL). EMCLL is a rare form of CLL that presents with lymphoid cell infiltration in extramedullary sites, such as the middle ear and mastoid. The patient's history of previous treatment with PETs and antibiotics, as well as the lack of other symptoms such as fever, malaise, or weight loss, also support this diagnosis. Skull base osteomyelitis (option A) is unlikely given the absence of symptoms or signs of intracranial involvement. Chronic nonsuppurative otitis media (option C) is a possibility, but the presence of a hypomobile tympanic membrane and the CT scan findings suggest a more aggressive process. Langerhans cell histiocytosis of the temporal bone (option D) is rare and typically presents with a more aggressive clinical course and characteristic histopathological findings.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive periorbital edema, proptosis, and nasal congestion, along with the imaging findings of extensive thickening of the left frontal bone and a homogeneously enhancing lesion within the left frontal sinus, are consistent with a diagnosis of fibrous dysplasia. Fibrous dysplasia is a benign bone tumor that can affect the frontal sinus and cause proptosis and periorbital edema. The presence of a soft-tissue component within the frontal sinus and the extension of the lesion into the orbit and intracranial region also support this diagnosis. Intraosseous meningioma (A) is a possibility, but the imaging findings do not suggest a typical meningioma. Mucocele (B) is unlikely given the absence of any history of sinus surgery or trauma. Osteosarcoma (D) is a malignant bone tumor that can affect the frontal sinus, but the imaging findings and clinical presentation do not suggest this diagnosis.

Answer: C 
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of sudden onset of neck swelling, pain, and progressive respiratory distress, along with the physical examination findings of trismus, rightward tracheal deviation, and a hoarse voice, suggest a serious respiratory obstruction. The contrast-enhanced CT scan of the neck shows a large hyperdense mass interposed between the left common carotid artery and the hypopharynx, resulting in lateral deviation of the left common carotid artery and medial deviation of the supraglottic larynx and hypopharynx, which further supports the diagnosis of a parapharyngeal abscess (option B). The density of the mass being identical to that of the adjacent vasculature also suggests an inflammatory or infectious process, rather than a vascular malformation (option A) or a neoplastic process (option C). The presence of periapical dental abscesses in two teeth (option D) may be a coincidental finding or a source of the infection. Therefore, option B, Parapharyngeal abscess, is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: **B**
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of central vision loss, bilateral lower leg swelling, rash, painful "bumps" on the neck, reduced hearing abilities, and tinnitus, along with the physical examination findings of tender lymphadenopathy and a maculopapular rash, suggest a systemic infection. The patient's history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and a low CD4 count of 600 further support this diagnosis. The yellowish placoid lesion and irregular thickening of the retinal pigment epithelium layer with small nodular elevations seen on optical coherence tomography (OCT) are consistent with a retinal infection, likely caused by a viral or fungal agent. Systemic antimicrobial treatment (answer B) would be the appropriate next step in management, as it would address the underlying infection and potentially prevent further vision loss. In contrast, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain (answer A) may be necessary later in the evaluation, but it would not address the immediate need for treatment of the suspected retinal infection. Serologic testing (answer C) may be useful in identifying the specific etiology of the infection, but it would not guide immediate management. Chorioretinal biopsy (answer D) would be an invasive procedure that may be necessary later in the management of the condition, but it would not be the most appropriate next step.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of acute-onset bilateral decreased vision, along with the physical examination findings of peripapillary retinal whitening and hypofluorescence on fluorescein angiogram, are concerning for a potential infectious etiology. The patient's history of altered mental status and absence of any known ophthalmic disorders or previous ocular surgery also support this consideration. Therefore, it would be appropriate to order bacterial and fungal blood cultures (option B) to evaluate for possible endogenous endophthalmitis or other infectious processes that may be affecting the retina.

Option A, ordering human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) serologies, may also be considered given the patient's age and symptoms, but it is less likely to be the primary cause of the patient's symptoms compared to an infectious etiology.

Option C, ordering a lipase level, is not directly related to the patient's symptoms or physical examination findings and is therefore less likely to be helpful in the patient's workup.

Option D, ordering antinuclear antibodies (ANA), may be considered in the context of a possible autoimmune disorder, but it is not the most likely diagnosis given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

Explanation: Given the patient's history of cutaneous melanoma and the presence of a pigmented iris lesion with satellite lesions, it is likely that the lesion is a melanoma that has spread to the eye. The patient's symptoms of eye pain and increased intraocular pressure also support this diagnosis. Initiating radiation therapy with plaque brachytherapy or proton beam therapy would be an appropriate next step in managing the patient's cancer, as it can help to reduce the size of the tumor and alleviate symptoms. Performing a transvitreal biopsy of the tumor (option A) may also be considered, but it may not be necessary given the patient's history and clinical appearance of the lesion. Iridocyclectomy (option C) and enucleation with orbital implant (option D) may also be considered, but they are more invasive procedures that may not be necessary at this time.

Explanation: The patient's FLT3 gene mutation is associated with a worse prognosis in AML, regardless of the length or burden of the duplication. The presence of an internal tandem duplication (ITD) in the FLT3 gene is a known poor prognostic marker in AML, and the patient's allelic ratio of 0.57 suggests that the mutation is present in a significant proportion of their leukemic cells. This indicates that the patient is more likely to have a worse prognosis compared to patients with wild-type FLT3 or other mutations. Therefore, answer A is the correct choice.

The presence of palpable purpura and petechiae, which are characteristic of vasculitis, supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of recurrent episodes of diverticulitis complicated by colovesical fistula and recent surgery may suggest a possible underlying autoimmune disorder. Performing direct immunofluorescence (DIF) evaluation of the skin biopsy can help confirm the diagnosis of vasculitis by identifying the presence of immune complex deposition in the blood vessels. This would be the most appropriate next step in the patient's workup before starting steroids or other immunosuppressive therapy. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's laboratory results show a high white blood cell count, high hemoglobin, and low platelet count, which are consistent with a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN). Additionally, the patient's bone marrow biopsy showed increased reticulin and extramedullary hematopoiesis, which are also consistent with MPN. The JAK2 V617F mutation is commonly found in patients with MPN, specifically in those with polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and primary myelofibrosis. The patient's clinical presentation of hepatic and portal vein thrombosis, which is a rare complication of MPN, also supports this diagnosis. Therefore, option A is the most likely diagnosis.

Option B, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, is a rare genetic disorder that affects the production of red blood cells and can cause thrombosis, but it is not typically associated with hepatic and portal vein thrombosis.

Option C, hereditary protein C deficiency, is a rare genetic disorder that affects the blood's ability to clot, but it is not typically associated with MPN or hepatic and portal vein thrombosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including the development of annular plaques with skin atrophy, pale and translucent skin, and visible veins, point to a diagnosis of porokeratosis. Porokeratosis is a rare skin condition that is distinguished by the growth of scaly patches and plaques. It frequently has a genetic component and can be related to other skin conditions, such as epidermolysis bullosa. The patient's skin atrophy and translucency are consistent with porokeratosis, as is the presence of individual keratotic papules surrounding the atrophic patches. The absence of a family history of similar cutaneous findings does not rule out the diagnosis, as porokeratosis can be a sporadic mutation.

Annular elastolytic giant cell granuloma (option A) is an uncommon condition that is characterized by the presence of multinucleated giant cells and elastophagocytosis. While the patient's skin atrophy may be consistent with this diagnosis, the absence of any history of skin trauma and the lack of giant cells in the biopsy specimen argue against this diagnosis.

Granuloma annulare (option B) is a benign condition that is characterized by the presence of small, discrete papules or nodules with a central crust or scab. While the patient's skin atrophy may be consistent with this diagnosis, the presence of arciform to annular plaques and the absence of any central crust or scab argue against this diagnosis.

Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome with elastosis perforans serpiginosa (option D) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the skin and blood vessels. It is characterized by the presence of fragile skin, bruising, and bleeding. While the patient's easy bruising and skin atrophy may be consistent with this diagnosis, the absence of any family history of similar cutaneous findings and the lack of any vascular abnormalities argue against this diagnosis.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and the results of the biopsy, the most likely diagnosis is porokeratosis.

Additionally, the patient's laboratory results, including anemia, abnormal liver function test results, and renal impairment with moderate proteinuria, are consistent with amyloidosis. The patient's serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) and immunofixation urine protein electrophoresis test results being normal also supports this diagnosis, as amyloidosis typically does not show abnormal protein bands on these tests.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's history of recurrent painless tongue masses since birth, their small size, and the fact that they occasionally grow in size and become red-filled vesicles that do not burst or bleed, are all consistent with the diagnosis of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). NF1 is a genetic disorder that affects the growth and development of nerve tissue, and it can cause benign tumors to grow on the nerves, including those in the tongue. The fact that the patient has no other symptoms or signs of illness, and that the lesions are not associated with fever or other rashes, also supports this diagnosis.

Herpes simplex virus infection (A) is unlikely because the patient does not have any signs of viral infection, such as fever, sore throat, or ulcers on the lips or tongue. Mucocele (B) is also unlikely because the patient's masses are not located in the mouth or lips, and they do not have the characteristic bluish color of mucoceles. Oral lymphangioma (D) is rare and usually presents as a single mass, not multiple masses, and it is usually associated with other symptoms such as pain, swelling, and difficulty swallowing.

Title: Acute Large-Bowel Obstruction in an Institutionalized Man

Answer: C

Explanation:
The correct answer is C, Sigmoid volvulus. The patient's symptoms of abdominal distension, tenderness, and peripheral hypoperfusion, along with the findings on plain abdominal radiograph and computed tomography scan, are consistent with a sigmoid volvulus. The "coffee-bean-like" or "bent inner tube" sign visible on the plain abdominal x-ray is a characteristic feature of sigmoid volvulus. Additionally, the patient's history of institutionalization and bedridden state suggests a higher likelihood of developing this condition.

Option A, Cecal volvulus, is less likely given the patient's symptoms and findings. Although both cecal and sigmoid volvuli can present with abdominal pain and distension, cecal volvulus typically causes more prominent symptoms of vomiting and abdominal tenderness, and the "coffee-bean-like" sign is not typically seen.

Option B, Aerophagia, is not a likely diagnosis given the patient's symptoms and findings. Aerophagia is a condition characterized by excessive air swallowing, which can lead to abdominal distension, but it does not typically cause the degree of abdominal tenderness or peripheral hypoperfusion seen in this patient.

Option D, Colonic ileus/colonic pseudoobstruction (Ogilvie syndrome), is also less likely. Although this condition can cause abdominal distension and tenderness, it is more commonly seen in patients with a history of abdominal surgery or other medical conditions, and typically presents with a more gradual onset of symptoms.

Answer: B
Explanation: Small-bowel intussusception occurs when a portion of the small intestine telescopes into another section, causing a mechanical obstruction. This can be caused by various factors, including pelvic adhesions, which are bands of fibrous tissue that can form in the pelvis as a result of previous surgery or inflammation. The patient's history of multiple abdominal surgeries and pelvic procedures increases the likelihood of pelvic adhesions. The patient's symptoms of sudden, severe epigastric pain, fever, and vomiting, as well as the physical examination findings of a distended and tympanic abdomen with tenderness, guarding, and rebound in the epigastrium and right upper quadrant, are consistent with small-bowel obstruction. The upright abdominal plain radiograph and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan findings of a distended, thickened stomach and multiple dilated loops of small bowel with air-fluid levels, as well as a focal area of mixed fat density involving the distal small bowel concerning for a lead point with adjacent mesenteric fat stranding, support the diagnosis of small-bowel intussusception. The presence of bilateral lung nodules on the CT scan may indicate metastatic disease, but this is not the most likely diagnosis given the patient's symptoms and imaging findings. Therefore, the correct answer is B, small-bowel intussusception secondary to pelvic adhesions.

Explanation: The patient has a medium-sized area of moderate stress-induced ischemia throughout the right coronary artery territory, which suggests that there is a blockage in the right coronary artery. The best course of action would be to perform a left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending artery, which would bypass the blockage and restore blood flow to the affected area. This procedure is a surgical intervention and would be more effective than medical therapy or transposition of the RCA from the pulmonary artery to the aorta. Percutaneous coronary intervention of the total RCA occlusion may also be considered, but the decision to perform this procedure would depend on various factors, such as the location and severity of the blockage, and the patient's overall health status.

Answer: C
Explanation: The marked discordance between the direct and calculated LDL levels in this case is likely due to the effects of very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), and/or lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)). VLDL and IDL are triglyceride-rich lipoproteins that can be converted to LDL in the bloodstream, leading to an increase in LDL-C levels. Lp(a) is a lipoprotein that contains apolipoprotein (a) and is known to be elevated in some patients with familial dysbetalipoproteinemia (type III hyperlipidemia). The patient in this case has a history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension, which may also contribute to dyslipidemia. Therefore, option C is the most likely explanation for the discordance between direct and calculated LDL levels.

Answer: C 
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as swelling involving the nasal bridge and right eye, intermittent ipsilateral epistaxis, and tenderness to palpation over the right nasal bridge, are consistent with a sinonasal mass. The physical examination findings, along with the computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging results, support the presence of a right-sided exophytic mass visible between the middle turbinate and nasal septum. The patient's history of allergic rhinitis and well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus increases the likelihood of a sinonasal tumor. The biopsy diagnosis of inflammatory nasal polyp and the immunoreactivity for S-100 protein and smooth muscle markers SMA and HHF35 in the final pathology report support the diagnosis of a biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma. Additionally, the absence of regional or distant metastasis and the TNM staging of cT4N0M0 further support this diagnosis. Therefore, option C, Biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma, is the correct answer.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of mild to moderate trismus and swelling on the left side of the face, along with the physical examination findings of left-sided facial swelling and no deficits of the facial or trigeminal nerves, are consistent with a diagnosis of osteosarcoma. The MRI findings of a mass lying on the anterior surface of the eroded left mandibular condyle with homogeneous isointensity relative to skeletal muscle, avid enhancement after contrast, homogeneous moderately hyperintense signal on T2-weighted image, and marked diffusion restriction on diffusion-weighted image, are also consistent with osteosarcoma. Plasmacytoma, ameloblastoma, and venous malformation are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and MRI findings.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as a slowly enlarging, nontender neck mass, and the histopathological findings, including a mixture of dark, granular, basophilic acinar cells and eosinophilic intercalated ductal cells with periodic acid–Schiff–positive, diastase-resistant intracytoplasmic granules, are consistent with a diagnosis of acinic cell carcinoma. Additionally, the tumor's location within a periparotid lymph node and the presence of focal areas of hyaline sclerosis without necrosis also support this diagnosis. Pleomorphic adenoma (Option A) typically has a more diverse cytological appearance and is less likely to have the distinctive histopathological features described in the case. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (Option B) usually has a more aggressive clinical course and would be unlikely to present as a slowly enlarging, nontender mass. HIV-associated benign lymphoepithelial cyst (Option D) is a rare entity that typically presents as a painless, slowly growing mass in the neck of HIV-infected patients and is not associated with the histopathological features described in the case. Therefore, Option C, acinic cell carcinoma, is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive vision loss, proptosis, and forehead tenderness, along with the imaging findings of a mass in the right anterior nasal cavity invading the right orbit, are consistent with an ethmoid mucocele. This is a type of benign tumor that arises from the nasal cavity and can infiltrate surrounding tissues. The patient's age and lack of other symptoms such as nasal congestion, epistaxis, weight loss, fevers, or chills also support this diagnosis. Esthesioneuroblastoma (A) is a rare type of cancer that arises from the nasal cavity and can cause similar symptoms, but it typically affects older adults and has a more aggressive clinical course. Rhabdomyosarcoma (B) is a type of cancer that can arise in the head and neck, but it is rare in the nasal cavity and more commonly affects children and young adults. Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (D) is a rare and aggressive type of cancer that can arise in the nasal cavity, but it typically presents with more severe symptoms and has a poorer prognosis than ethmoid mucocele.

Answer: C
Explanation: A lumbar puncture (LP) is the next step in the diagnostic workup of this patient. The patient's symptoms of headaches, blurry vision, and bilateral optic disc swelling suggest possible elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) or cerebral edema. The presence of subretinal fluid, exudates, and retinal hemorrhages in one eye also raises concern for a potential neurosurgical emergency. An LP would allow for the measurement of opening pressure, which can help assess ICP, as well as the analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for cell count, protein, and other markers that can aid in the diagnosis of various neurological conditions. Additionally, LP can help to relieve pressure and improve symptoms in some cases. While observation and conservative management (option A) may be appropriate for some patients with headaches and blurry vision, the presence of bilateral optic disc swelling and subretinal fluid suggests a more urgent need for diagnostic evaluation. Surgical intervention (option B) may be necessary in some cases, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's management. High-dose corticosteroids (option D) may be considered in certain diagnoses, but they are not the most appropriate initial treatment for this patient's symptoms and examination findings.

Explanation: The patient's condition has progressed to a dense, serpentine network of subepithelial deposits with adjacent neovascularization in the superior cornea, extending toward the visual axis, which is causing a decrease in visual acuity. Subconjunctival injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) medication is a common treatment for corneal neovascularization, and it can help to reduce the progression of the disease and improve visual acuity. The other options, crescent-shaped lamellar keratoplasty, thorough ocular adnexal evaluation with eyelid eversion, and refraction with rigid gas permeable contact lens fitting, may not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and may not improve visual acuity.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of bilateral ocular pain and hyperemia, along with the physical findings of bilateral nasal sectoral subconjunctival hemorrhages, suggest a diagnosis of uveitis. The fact that the symptoms developed within 24 hours of the patient receiving his first zoledronic acid infusion and improved within 4 days suggests a possible association between the medication and the uveitis. Preemptively treating the patient before his next dose of zoledronic acid, as option C suggests, would be the most appropriate course of action to prevent a recurrence of the uveitis. Option A, advising the patient's endocrinologist to request an alternative to a bisphosphonate, may not be necessary at this time, as the patient's symptoms have already improved with treatment. Option B, rechallenging the patient in 12 months with zoledronic acid and managing reactively if uveitis recurs, may not be the best approach, as it could lead to another episode of uveitis. Option D, treating the problem as an unrelated idiopathic uveitis, may not be accurate, as the patient's symptoms seem to be related to the zoledronic acid infusion.

Answer: C 
Explanation: The patient presents with signs of orbital cellulitis, which is a medical emergency requiring prompt treatment. The patient's symptoms, such as swollen, blistered eyelids, erythema, edema, and pain, along with the physical examination findings of warmth, redness, and tenderness of the eyelids, and the presence of large fluctuant blisters, are all consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's recent fall and untreated eyelid laceration increase the likelihood of infection. Orbital cellulitis can lead to serious complications, such as vision loss, if left untreated. Therefore, it is important to start treatment promptly. Admitting the patient for intravenous antibiotics and performing bedside incision and drainage of the blisters (Option C) is the most appropriate course of action. Starting oral antibiotics and discharging the patient home with follow-up the next day (Option A) may not be sufficient to treat the infection aggressively, and may lead to further complications. Performing aggressive debridement of the eyelids in the operating room and giving intravenous antibiotics (Option D) may be necessary in some cases, but it is not the most appropriate first step in this situation.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's history of multiple cancers, including high-grade osteosarcoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, increases the likelihood of a metastatic lesion in the thyroid gland. The patient's young age and absence of thyroid dysfunction also support this diagnosis. The positive immunostain results for vimentin and negative results for S-100, TTF-1, and CD34 are consistent with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. The calcified mass seen on CT imaging is also a common feature of anaplastic thyroid carcinoma.

Thyroid lymphoma is unlikely given the patient's age and lack of lymphadenopathy. Osteosarcoma metastasis is less likely since the patient had a recent diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma and the thyroid mass is not consistent with osteosarcoma metastasis. Squamous cell carcinoma metastasis is also less likely given the patient's history of squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix and the negative immunostain results for S-100.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of facial rash, fever, and anemia, along with the family history of negative IgG antibodies against rubella virus and herpes zoster virus, and serology findings negative for human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, and syphilis, suggest that the patient may have a diagnosis of neonatal lupus erythematosus (NLE). NLE is a rare autoimmune disease that occurs in infants of mothers with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or other autoimmune disorders. The presence of annular erythematous plaques with central atrophy and raised margins on the forehead and periorbital areas is consistent with the characteristic skin lesions of NLE.

Therefore, it is appropriate to order antinuclear antibody, anti-Ro/SS-A, and anti-La/SS-B antibody testing for both the infant and his mother to confirm the diagnosis of NLE. This testing can help identify the presence of autoantibodies in the mother's blood, which can be passed to the infant and cause the skin lesions and other symptoms.

Providing education on proper facial cleansing and moisturizing (option A) may help alleviate some of the symptoms, but it is not a definitive treatment for NLE. Administering topical antifungals (option B) would not be appropriate as the patient does not have a fungal infection. Ordering a serologic test for syphilis for the infant (option D) would also not be appropriate as there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has syphilis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including the growth of nodules on the genital and perianal region, ulceration, and yellow-colored discharge, are consistent with cutaneous cryptococcosis. Cryptococcosis is a fungal infection caused by Cryptococcus neoformans, which can affect the skin and other organs. The patient's history of chronic graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) and immunosuppressive therapy increases her risk of developing opportunistic infections like cryptococcosis. The yellowish nodules on the left labia majora and the perianal area, as well as the surrounding inflammatory reaction, are also consistent with cutaneous cryptococcosis.

The other options are less likely:

A: Atypical mycobacterial infection - While mycobacterial infections can cause skin lesions, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are not consistent with this diagnosis.

B: Cutaneous malakoplakia - Malakoplakia is a rare condition characterized by the accumulation of macrophages in the skin, resulting in papules or nodules. While it can be associated with immunosuppression, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are not consistent with this diagnosis.

D: Calcinosis cutis - Calcinosis cutis is a condition characterized by the deposition of calcium salts in the skin, resulting in firm, yellowish nodules. While it can be associated with chronic GVHD, the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are not consistent with this diagnosis.

Answer: C 
Explanation: The clinical presentation of well-demarcated erythematous to violaceous verrucous nodules on the right lateral leg and dorsal foot, restricted to zones of pink pigment within the tattoo, sparing other colors present, suggests a diagnosis of pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia (PEH). PEH is a benign proliferative condition that can occur in response to various stimuli, including tattoo ink. The histopathologic features shown in Figure 1B, including a dense lymphocytic infiltrate, follicular dendritic cells, and a lack of cytological atypia, support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of discoid lupus, which is a chronic autoimmune condition that can cause skin lesions, increases the likelihood of PEH. Eruptive keratoacanthomas (EKA) are characterized by rapid growth of multiple keratoacanthomas, typically on sun-exposed areas, and are associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. Sarcoidosis arising in a tattoo is a rare complication that can present with skin lesions, but the clinical and histopathological features are different from those seen in PEH. Hypertrophic discoid lupus is a variant of cutaneous lupus erythematosus that is characterized by hyperkeratosis, follicular plugging, and dilated blood vessels, but it does not typically present with the verrucous nodules seen in this case.

Answer: C. Rowell syndrome.
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including fever, generalized eruption, and bullae, are consistent with Rowell syndrome, a rare autoimmune disorder that is often associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The presence of atypical target lesions on the patient's back, thighs, legs, palms, and soles, as well as the presence of dusky malar erythema with focal heme crusting, are also consistent with Rowell syndrome. Additionally, the patient's history of SLE and the presence of hypocomplementemia, anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, and positive anti-Smith, anti-ribonucleoprotein, and SSA/anti-Ro antibodies support the diagnosis of Rowell syndrome. Pemphigus erythematosus (option A) is an autoimmune blistering disorder that can cause bullae and erosions, but it typically does not involve the malar region or produce atypical target lesions. Generalized fixed drug eruption (option B) can cause widespread skin eruptions, but it is not associated with the other symptoms and laboratory findings in this case. Toxic epidermal necrolysis (option D) is a severe, life-threatening skin reaction that can cause blisters and erosions, but it is typically associated with a medication reaction, and there is no evidence of this in the patient's history.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of recurrent, transient episodes of dysarthria, dysphagia, and limb weakness, along with the physical examination findings of diminished muscle tone, bilateral positive Babinski signs, and extensive bilateral nerve conduction abnormalities, are consistent with a demyelinating disease such as multiple sclerosis or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis. The patient's history of recurrent episodes and the presence of cerebral white matter lesions on MRI also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the significant reduction of the abnormal signal on MRI 3 months later suggests that the patient may have experienced a relapse of the demyelinating disease.

The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and examination findings as well. Option A, transient ischemic attack, does not explain the patient's recurrent episodes or the presence of cerebral white matter lesions. Option C, periodic paralysis, does not fit the patient's symptoms of dysarthria, dysphagia, and limb weakness, which are not typically seen in periodic paralysis. Option D, X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease 1, is a genetic disorder that affects the peripheral nervous system and does not explain the patient's cerebral white matter lesions or recurrent episodes.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of intermittent diplopia, mild ptosis, and restricted eye movements, particularly in the right eye, are consistent with ocular neuromyotonia of the third nerve. The accentuation of anisocoria in bright ambient light and the marked restriction of elevation, depression, and abduction in the right eye after eccentric gaze also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of a pituitary macroadenoma and radiation therapy increases the likelihood of a neuromyotonia syndrome. Ocular myasthenia (Option A) is less likely given the absence of associated symptoms such as ptosis, weakness, or fatigue. Giant cell arteritis (Option C) is unlikely given the absence of symptoms such as headache, visual loss, or jaw claudication.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive action tremor, balance problems, and executive dysfunction, along with the presence of cerebellar signs such as jerky eye pursuit, saccadic dysmetria, and impaired tandem walking, suggest a diagnosis of Fragile X-associated tremor ataxia syndrome (FXTAS). This is a genetic disorder caused by an expansion of a CGG repeat in the FMR1 gene, leading to a deficiency in the production of the Fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP). The patient's family history of ischemic heart disease and lack of a family history of neurological disorder make vascular dementia (B) less likely. The patient's age and lack of a history of neurological symptoms prior to the onset of tremors also argue against a diagnosis of essential tremor (D). Multiple system atrophy (A) is a possibility, but the patient's lack of autonomic dysfunction and the presence of cerebellar signs suggest FXTAS as a more likely diagnosis.

It is a type of congenital skin lesion that can occur anywhere on the body, including the lower back. The appearance of a red patch with a soft nodule and a pedunculated red papule on top, as described in the case, is consistent with a dermoid cyst. Additionally, the fact that the baby is asymptomatic and has no other abnormalities, such as spinal dysraphism, and the absence of any teratogenic exposure or family history of congenital defects, also support this diagnosis. Finally, the absence of any abnormalities on ultrasonography of the spine further suggests that the lesion is likely to be a dermoid cyst rather than a more serious condition such as spinal dysraphism.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient has severe hypercholesterolemia and primary sclerosing cholangitis, which is a rare form of dyslipidemia known as lipoprotein X (LpX). This is characterized by high unesterified cholesterol and phospholipids in large lipid-containing particles. The patient's symptoms, such as periorbital xanthelasmata and palmar xanthomata, are also indicative of this condition.

Given the patient's history and laboratory results, the best course of action would be to begin therapeutic plasma exchange plus rosuvastatin, 20 mg per day. Therapeutic plasma exchange is a procedure that removes certain components from the blood, including lipids, and can help to reduce the levels of unesterified cholesterol and phospholipids in the blood. Rosuvastatin, a statin medication, can also help to reduce cholesterol levels and improve lipid profiles.

Option A, resolving obstructive cholestasis with biliary stent placement, may be necessary in the future, but it is not the most appropriate next step for this patient. The patient's primary issue is the severe hypercholesterolemia, which needs to be addressed promptly to prevent further complications.

Option B, beginning rosuvastatin, 20 mg per day, may be a reasonable option, but it is not the most appropriate choice given the patient's unique lipid profile and the presence of LpX.

Option D, beginning therapeutic plasma exchange, may also be a reasonable option, but it is not the most appropriate choice as it does not address the underlying dyslipidemia and may not be effective in reducing cholesterol levels.

Answer: C
Explanation: The given clinical case describes a cystic lesion on the lower lip of a patient with a history of substance abuse and chronic medical conditions. The lesion is described as being nontender, mobile, and cystic, with an outflow of clear serous fluid on palpation. The histopathological examination reveals an endophytic growing lesion consisting of acanthotic epidermoid epithelium organized in broad papillary folds, with an infiltrating border. Mucocytes are present, both individually dispersed throughout the epithelium and organized in small tubuloacinar structures emptying onto the surface. The epithelium is infiltrated by neutrophils, but atypia or mitotic figures are absent. The subepithelial stroma contains normal-appearing seromucous acini. Based on these findings, the diagnosis is most likely a mucocele (option C). A mucocele is a benign tumor that arises from the salivary gland ducts and is characterized by a cystic or semi-cystic structure filled with mucin. The histopathological features described in the case, such as the endophytic growth pattern, acanthotic epidermoid epithelium, and presence of mucocytes, are consistent with a mucocele. In contrast, intraductal papilloma (option A) is a benign tumor that arises from the salivary gland ducts and typically presents as a small, painless mass in the mouth. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma (option B) is a malignant tumor that arises from the salivary gland ducts and is characterized by a mix of squamous and glandular differentiation. Oral inverted ductal papilloma (option D) is a rare benign tumor that arises from the salivary gland ducts and is characterized by a cystic or semi-cystic structure filled with mucin, but it typically lacks the acanthotic epidermoid epithelium and infiltrating border seen in this case.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of left-sided facial pain, fullness, and trismus, along with the physical examination findings of mild tenderness over a mass that extends inferiorly to the zygoma and posterolaterally to the left superior molars, are consistent with a diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma. The patient's age and the location of the mass in the left infratemporal fossa, maxillary sinus, and nasal cavity also support this diagnosis. Rhabdomyosarcoma is a type of malignant tumor that develops in the soft tissues of the body, such as muscles, tendons, and connective tissue. It is more common in children and young adults, and often presents with symptoms related to the location of the tumor. The patient's history of a recent dental procedure and the absence of purulence or clinically significant bleeding on the CT scan also suggest that the mass is not an abscess or a benign tumor. The contrast-enhanced MRI with fat saturation shows a mass with mild punctuate areas of hypointense signal (suggestive of vascularity) terminating in the left buccinator space with extension into the nasal cavity, maxillary sinus, and inferior orbital fissure, which is consistent with the diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

Answer: C
Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of recurrent unilateral swelling of the parotid gland, along with the palpable mass and neck swelling, are consistent with an arteriovenous malformation (AVM). The imaging findings, including the T2 hyperintense lesion on the coronal STIR image and the homogenous contrast-enhancing lesion on the delayed phase of the T1-weighted, fat-suppressed, gadolinium-enhanced angiography, also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the absence of a high flow component on the arterial section of the angiography and the patient's history of malignant hypertension, which can be associated with AVMs, further support this diagnosis. Venous malformations and lymphatic malformations may also present with neck swelling, but they typically do not have the same imaging features as AVMs. Chronic sialadenitis, or inflammation of the parotid gland, may also present with neck swelling and pain, but it would not explain the palpable mass or the imaging findings.

Answer: C: Electrophysiology
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of rapid loss of vision, blurry vision, and photopsias, along with the physical examination findings of a white ring surrounding the optic nerve, suggest a possible diagnosis of a retinal degenerative disorder. Electrophysiology testing, such as electroretinography (ERG), can help to confirm this diagnosis by assessing the function of the retina and detecting any abnormalities in the retinal cells. This test can provide valuable information about the retina's response to light and can help to differentiate between various retinal disorders.

Therefore, option C is the most appropriate next step in the patient's management. Option A, treatment with oral prednisone, may be considered later if the diagnosis is confirmed to be a retinal degenerative disorder, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this point. Option B, full laboratory workup for uveitis, is not indicated as the patient does not have any signs of uveitis.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of bilateral vision loss, ear pain, hearing loss, and severe headaches, along with the physical examination findings of afferent pupillary defect, inflamed tympanic membranes, and grade 2 optic disc edema with an inferior disc hemorrhage, suggest a possible diagnosis of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). PRES is a condition that is often associated with hypertension, sleep apnea, and immune-mediated disorders. The patient's history of hypertension and sleep apnea, as well as the elevated C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rates, support this diagnosis. The diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging also supports this diagnosis, as PRES is characterized by inflammation of the dura mater and arachnoid membrane. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) testing is appropriate to consider in this case, as ANCA-associated vasculitis has been associated with PRES. Therefore, answer B is the correct choice.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of personality changes, headache, decreased vision bilaterally, hearing loss, vertigo, gait imbalance, and ataxia, along with the physical examination findings of retinal vascular changes, are consistent with Susac syndrome. Susac syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the retina and the central nervous system. It is characterized by the presence of retinal vascular occlusions, retinal hemorrhages, and areas of retinal nonperfusion, which are consistent with the findings on fluorescein angiography. The patient's elevated white blood cell count and lymphocytosis on lumbar puncture also support the diagnosis.

The other options are not appropriate for this patient's condition. Dimethyl fumarate is used to treat relapsing multiple sclerosis, but it is not indicated for Susac syndrome. Intravenous acyclovir and intravitreal foscarnet are used to treat viral retinitis, but there is no evidence of viral infection in this patient. Observing for acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy may be appropriate for some patients with retinal changes, but it is not the most appropriate next step for this patient given the presence of retinal vascular changes and the patient's systemic symptoms.

Answer: D
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and test results indicate a diaphragmatic rupture and a traumatic rupture of the descending thoracic aorta. The elevation of the left hemidiaphragm on the chest radiography (Figure 1A) and the presence of a mediastinal hematoma on the computed tomographic scan of the chest (Figure 1B) support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's hypotension and transient response to fluid resuscitation suggest significant blood loss, which is consistent with a rupture of the descending thoracic aorta.

The other options do not accurately describe the patient's condition:

A) Diaphragmatic eventration with lung collapse: This option is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and test results do not suggest a lung collapse.

B) Pneumothorax with elevation of the left hemidiaphragm: This option is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and test results suggest a diaphragmatic rupture, rather than a pneumothorax.

C) Diaphragmatic rupture and a mediastinal hematoma: This option is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and test results also suggest a traumatic rupture of the descending thoracic aorta, which is not included in this option.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of recurrent lower gastrointestinal bleeding, abdominal pain, and a mass-like thickening of the sigmoid colon on CT scan are consistent with a diagnosis of sigmoid adenocarcinoma. The patient's history of factor 1 deficiency and lack of family history of colon cancer reduce the likelihood of other possible diagnoses such as rectosigmoid polyp or leiomyoma. Additionally, the presence of an exquisitely painful nodule at the rectosigmoid junction and normal colonic mucosa on biopsy support the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. Sigmoid endometriosis is a rare condition and is not typically associated with bleeding or a mass-like lesion. Therefore, option A, sigmoid adenocarcinoma, is the most likely diagnosis.

Explanation: Immune-related hypophysitis is a rare but known side effect of immune checkpoint inhibitors, including ipilimumab and nivolumab. The patient's symptoms of headache, fatigue, and difficulty reading, along with the laboratory findings of low cortisol and ACTH levels, are consistent with this diagnosis. The MRI findings of a mass in the sellar region, which was not present on a previous MRI, also support this diagnosis. The patient's history of melanoma and treatment with immunotherapy increases the likelihood of an immune-related adverse event. The other options, brain metastasis, pituitary adenoma, and mucocele, are less likely given the patient's symptoms and laboratory findings.

Answer: D
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of yellowing skin on her palms and soles are consistent with a condition called carotenemia, which is caused by the deposition of carotenoids in the skin. The most likely cause of this condition in this patient is the ingestion of excessive amounts of beta-carotene from the nutritional supplement she has been taking. Discontinuing the supplement would be the appropriate next step in management, as it is likely that the yellowing of the skin will resolve once the source of the carotenoids is removed. Performing a biopsy (option A) would not be necessary at this point, as the diagnosis can be made based on the clinical presentation and laboratory tests. Repeat liver function tests (option B) may be unnecessary, as the patient's liver function tests are already normal. Empirically treating with a topical steroid (option C) would not be effective in resolving the underlying cause of the condition.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's presentation of acute anuric renal failure, with a history of hypertension and stage 4 chronic kidney disease, suggests a diagnosis of acute kidney injury (AKI) superimposed on chronic kidney disease (CKD). The patient's urinalysis showing minimal albuminuria and spot urine protein to creatinine ratio predicting 11,139 mg/g proteinuria, along with the absence of hydronephrosis on renal ultrasound, suggests that the AKI is not caused by acute interstitial nephritis or obstruction. The patient's laboratory results, particularly the elevated serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen levels, and the low estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), further support this diagnosis.

The bone marrow biopsy showing a normocellular bone marrow with 10% κ-restricted plasma cells and positive immunohistochemical staining for the plasma cell marker CD138 suggests a diagnosis of multiple myeloma. The patient's symptoms of muscle cramps and oliguria, as well as the laboratory results, are consistent with myeloma-related kidney disease.

Initiating bortezomib-dexamethasone–based therapy (option B) would be appropriate for the patient's multiple myeloma, which is likely contributing to the AKI. This therapy has been shown to be effective in treating myeloma and improving renal function in patients with myeloma-related kidney disease.

Continuing IV fluids and administering furosemide (option A) may help to manage the patient's fluid status and potentially improve urine output, but it would not address the underlying cause of the AKI.

Obtaining a renal biopsy (option C) may provide additional information about the cause of the AKI, but it would not be necessary in this case given the patient's history and laboratory results, which strongly suggest a diagnosis of myeloma-related kidney disease.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with malaria, which is a likely diagnosis given the patient's recent travel to Sierra Leone, where malaria is endemic. The patient's lack of malaria prophylaxis and insect repellent use during travel also increases the likelihood of malaria. Option C, starting intravenous quinidine gluconate and doxycycline, is the appropriate treatment for severe malaria, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Option A, starting artemether-lumefantrine, may also be effective, but it is not the first-line treatment for severe malaria. Option B, starting chloroquine, is not recommended for the treatment of malaria in adults, as it is not effective against the most severe forms of the disease.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including multiple violaceous plaques on the extensor surface of the knees and asymptomatic erythematous nodules on the calcanea, are consistent with knee-located erythema elevatum diutinum (EED) with a calcaneal late-stage nodular component. EED is a rare condition characterized by the development of erythematous plaques on the extensor surfaces of the knees, elbows, and occasionally, the calcanea. The late-stage nodular component is consistent with the patient's age, as EED typically presents in the second to third decade of life. The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms or clinical presentation. Elastolytic granuloma is a condition characterized by the destruction of elastic tissue in the dermis, typically caused by a hypersensitivity reaction to elastic tissue. Epithelioid sarcoma is a rare malignant tumor that can arise in the skin or subcutaneous tissue, but it typically presents as a solitary nodule rather than multiple nodules and plaques.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with pemphigoid gestationis, an autoimmune disease that occurs during pregnancy. The patient's history of Darier disease, a skin condition characterized by keratotic papules and plaques, increases the likelihood of this diagnosis. The histopathological images show full-thickness epidermal necrosis with focal areas of suprabasal acantholysis, corp ronds, corp grains, and parakeratosis, which are all consistent with pemphigoid gestationis. The presence of multinucleated cells with nuclear molding and margination also supports this diagnosis. Impetigo (option B) and impetigo herpetiformis (option D) are bacterial infections that can cause skin lesions, but they do not match the patient's symptoms or laboratory results. Kaposi varicelliform eruption (option A) is a rare condition that occurs in patients with Kaposi sarcoma, and it does not match the patient's symptoms or laboratory results.

Leprosy is a chronic bacterial infection caused by Mycobacterium leprae, which affects the skin, nerves, and mucous membranes. The patient's skin biopsy showing diffuse infiltrate of foamy histiocytes in the dermis and the presence of acid-fast bacilli on acid-fast stain support the diagnosis of leprosy. The patient's history of previous treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and the lack of response to treatment suggest that the patient may have been misdiagnosed.

Answer: C: Pharmacotherapy with prazosin
Explanation: Prazosin is a medication that has been shown to be effective in reducing symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in military veterans. It works by blocking the action of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, which is involved in the body's "fight or flight" response. By reducing the activity of norepinephrine, prazosin can help to reduce the physical and emotional symptoms associated with PTSD, such as anxiety, panic, and nightmares. In contrast, risperidone and propranolol are medications that are commonly used to treat other mental health conditions, such as schizophrenia and anxiety disorders, but have not been shown to be effective in treating PTSD specifically. Trauma-focused psychotherapy, while a crucial component of PTSD treatment, may not be the most appropriate next step for this patient given the severity of his symptoms and the fact that he has already tried and discontinued an SSRI.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of postural lightheadedness, worsening fatigue, muscle weakness, salt cravings, loss of axillary hair, and missed periods for 2 months, as well as the physical examination findings of hypopigmentation of the knuckles, distal fingers, and tongue, are consistent with primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease). The patient's weight loss and decreased body mass index also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of idiopathic intracranial hypertension increases the likelihood of an endocrinological disorder such as Addison disease. Hypervitaminosis A (option A) is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (option B) may be a comorbid condition, but it does not explain the patient's other symptoms and physical examination findings.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient has a history of tetralogy of Fallot, which is associated with pulmonary regurgitation. The echocardiogram shows a large RV diastolic volume index, indicating volume overload of the right ventricle. Additionally, there is a prominent A wave in the jugular venous pulse, indicating increased pressure in the right atrium. These findings suggest that the patient has significant pulmonary regurgitation, which is likely causing volume overload on the right ventricle. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to consider pulmonary valve replacement (option C). Sildenafil (option A) may be considered for pulmonary hypertension, but it would not address the underlying cause of the volume overload. Balloon valvotomy (option B) may be considered for pulmonary valvular stenosis, but it is not indicated in this case as there is no evidence of stenosis. Surgical intervention for residual ventricular septal defect (option D) may be necessary, but it is not the most appropriate next step given the patient's current symptoms and echocardiogram findings.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive dysphagia, tender right-sided neck fullness, and imaging findings of a heterogeneously enhancing mass in the right side of the neck, splaying and completely surrounding both the internal and external carotid arteries, are consistent with a diagnosis of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC). MTC is a type of thyroid cancer that originates in the parafollicular cells (C cells) of the thyroid gland and can produce calcitonin. The patient's history of heavy drinking and smoking may also increase the risk of developing MTC. The presence of scattered lymph nodes and the absence of any suspicious pulmonary or mediastinal lesions on chest radiography also support this diagnosis.

The other options are less likely:

Atypical carcinoid (A) is a rare type of lung cancer that can metastasize to the neck, but it is unlikely given the patient's history and imaging findings.

Malignant carotid body tumor (B) is a rare type of paraganglioma that can occur in the carotid body, but it is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.

Hemangiopericytoma (D) is a rare type of vascular tumor that can occur in the soft tissues of the neck, but it is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is medullary thyroid carcinoma (C).

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of nasal congestion, noisy breathing, and respiratory distress, along with the physical examination findings of a mucosalized mass filling the left nasal cavity, are consistent with a nasal tumor. The maxillofacial CT scan and MRI findings of a 2-cm heterogeneous mass in the left mid-nasal cavity, compressing the middle turbinate and lamina papyracea, without intracranial extension, also support this diagnosis. The histologic examination findings of a lesion characterized by regions of cartilage admixed with irregular areas of chondromyxoid stroma containing spindle cells, are consistent with a nasal chondromesenchymal hamartoma. Therefore, option C, Nasal chondromesenchymal hamartoma, is the most likely diagnosis.

The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and findings as well. Option A, Intranasal glioma, is a type of brain tumor that originates in the nasal cavity, but it is less likely given the patient's age and the absence of any intracranial extension. Option B, Basal encephalocele, is a type of neural tube defect in which the meninges protrude through a skull defect, but it does not explain the patient's respiratory symptoms or the mass observed on imaging. Option D, Teratoma, is a type of benign tumor that can occur in various parts of the body, including the nasal cavity, but it is not characterized by the combination of cartilage and chondromyxoid stroma as seen in the patient's histologic examination.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive sore throat, globus sensation, and dysphagia, along with the physical examination findings of a submucosal right retropharyngeal mass extending from the soft palate to the postcricoid, are consistent with a retropharyngeal tumor. The contrast-enhanced CT and MRI findings of a T2 hyperintense, enhancing mass in the retropharyngeal and prevertebral spaces with marrow replacement of the C2 vertebral body extending to the odontoid, are also consistent with a retropharyngeal tumor. The histopathologic findings of sheets and cords of tumor cells with eosinophilic granular, clear, or bubbly cytoplasm on a basophilic myxoid stromal background, and scattered physaliphorous cells, are consistent with a chondrosarcoma. Additionally, the positive immunohistochemical analysis for brachyury supports the diagnosis of chondrosarcoma. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Chondrosarcoma.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as unilateral neck swelling, and the imaging results, including a firm, immobile, and nontender mass affixed to the underlying right mandible, with cortical destruction and extension into the submandibular and sublingual spaces, are consistent with a desmoid tumor. The lesion's isointense signal on T1 sequence, heterogeneously hyperintense signal with internal foci of decreased intensity on T2 sequence, and homogeneous contrast enhancement also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the positive immunohistochemical analysis for β-catenin and negative results for CD34, desmin, and smooth muscle actin are consistent with a desmoid tumor. The absence of clonal abnormalities and the patient's negative genetic testing for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) mutations further support this diagnosis. Ewing sarcoma, eosinophilic granuloma, and lymphoma are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and imaging results.

Explanation: The patient's history of gradual onset of bilateral ptosis, along with the strong family history of bilateral ptosis, suggests a possible genetic etiology. The absence of other neurological symptoms, such as dysarthria, dyspnea, or diplopia, also supports a genetic cause. The patient's age and lack of other medical conditions make it less likely that the ptosis is caused by a acquired condition such as myasthenia gravis or a neurodegenerative disorder. Therefore, genetic testing for GCG triplet repeats, which are associated with hereditary ptosis, would be the most appropriate next step in management.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of blurry vision and frontal headaches, along with the physical examination findings of optic nerve hyperemia and shallow serous retinal detachments, suggest a diagnosis of central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC). This is a common condition that affects the retina and can cause vision loss if left untreated. The fluorescein angiography findings of optic disc leakage, hyperfluorescence, and pooling in the areas of serous detachment further support this diagnosis.

The appropriate next step in management would be to start prednisone at 80 mg daily with a slow taper, as option C states. This treatment has been shown to improve visual acuity and reduce the risk of recurrence in patients with CSC. Surgical decompression of vortex veins (option A) is not necessary in this case, as the patient does not have any signs of venous insufficiency. Performing B-scan ultrasonography (option B) may be useful in some cases of retinal disease, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this particular case. Checking blood pressure (option D) is important in any patient evaluation, but it is not directly related to the patient's current symptoms and findings.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of sudden onset of flashes and blurry vision, along with the physical examination findings of bilateral flame-shaped and intraretinal hemorrhages, suggest a possible diagnosis of retinal vasculitis. This is supported by the presence of hard exudates in the left macula and the findings on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. Retinal vasculitis can be associated with a systemic inflammatory condition, and a complete blood cell count (CBC) would be appropriate to rule out any underlying hematological disorders. Therefore, option C is the most appropriate next step in management.

Option A, obtaining an infectious and inflammatory panel, may also be considered, but a CBC would be a more targeted and specific test to evaluate for potential hematological causes of retinal vasculitis.

Option B, observing the patient without further testing, would not be appropriate given the sudden onset and severity of the patient's symptoms, and the presence of bilateral retinal hemorrhages.

Option D, injecting an anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is not indicated at this stage, as there is no evidence of neovascularization or severe retinal edema that would warrant such treatment. Additionally, anti-VEGF therapy is typically used for conditions such as age-related macular degeneration, diabetic retinopathy, and retinal vein occlusion, and would not be appropriate for retinal vasculitis.

The absence of choroidal involvement on B-scan ultrasonography suggests that the uveitis is likely anterior. The patient's history of glaucoma and recent periocular steroid injections increase the likelihood of steroid-induced uveitis. Observation and management of glaucoma, rather than immediate surgical intervention, is the appropriate next step. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Observe and manage glaucoma.

The ultrasonography and CECT scan findings of a large hypoechoic area in the right lobe of the liver, along with gallstones, are also consistent with acute cholecystitis. Additionally, the presence of a gallbladder fundus just caudal to the hypodense area suggests that the gallbladder has perforated into the liver, which is consistent with the diagnosis of acute cholecystitis with intrahepatic perforation.

Answer: C
Explanation: The given case describes a cystic lesion in the right iliac fossa, which is close to the cecum. Meckel diverticulum is a congenital pouch-like structure that protrudes from the antimesenteric border of the ileum, typically within 60 cm of the ileocecal valve. It is a common incidental finding during laparoscopic or open surgery, and its prevalence increases with age. Meckel diverticulum can be asymptomatic or can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, depending on its size and location. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, as well as the results of other investigations, do not suggest any other possible diagnosis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Meckel diverticulum.

Mucocele of the appendix (option A) is an uncommon condition that can mimic appendicitis. It is characterized by a cystic dilatation of the appendiceal lumen, filled with mucinous material. However, the location of the cystic lesion in the right iliac fossa, close to the cecum, does not support this diagnosis.

Cecal diverticulum (option B) is a rare condition that can cause symptoms similar to Meckel diverticulum. However, it typically occurs in older adults and is often associated with other colonic pathologies. The patient's age and the absence of other colonic pathologies make this diagnosis less likely.

Ileal duplication cyst (option D) is a rare congenital anomaly that can occur anywhere along the length of the small intestine. It is characterized by a duplicate segment of small intestine that is connected to the rest of the small intestine by a narrow neck. This diagnosis is unlikely given the location of the cystic lesion and the absence of other symptoms or findings suggestive of a duplication cyst.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, imaging findings, and pathology results are consistent with atypical mucinous cystic neoplasia (AMCN) of the pancreas. The large cystic lesion with septations and well-defined margins, along with the absence of tumor cells or mucinous material in the aspirate, are characteristic features of AMCN. Additionally, the positive immunostain for α-smooth muscle actin and CD117, and negative immunostain for CD34, support the diagnosis of AMCN. Solid pseudopapillary neoplasia (Option A) typically has a more solid and papillary architecture, and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (Option C) would not have the cystic components seen in this case.

The presence of vesicles with purulent fluid on an erythematous base, absence of lymphadenopathy, lymphangitis, or mucous membrane involvement, and lack of rash elsewhere on the body are all consistent with HSV. The patient's history of a "spider bite" and recent exposure to an old building suggest a possible exposure to HSV through a contaminated surface or contact with an infected person. The patient's recent use of clindamycin and valacyclovir may have helped to reduce the severity of symptoms, but they are not sufficient to treat the underlying HSV infection.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of increasing dyspnea on exertion and the presence of a nonocclusive thrombus in the left femoral and popliteal veins suggest that the patient has developed a pulmonary embolism. The ventilation-perfusion scan (V/Q scan) and pulmonary angiography confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism. The appropriate next step in management would be to start heparin treatment followed by an oral anticoagulant for 6 months to prevent further thrombus formation and to treat the existing pulmonary embolism. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.

Option A, starting parenteral corticosteroids and nebulized bronchodilators, may be appropriate for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who experience exacerbations, but it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient's current condition.

Option C, referring the patient for surgical embolectomy, may be considered for patients with large, central pulmonary emboli, but it is not the most appropriate choice for this patient's condition, as the emboli are not central and the patient's symptoms are not severe enough to warrant emergency surgical intervention.

The patient's history of atopic dermatitis increases the likelihood of this diagnosis, as MF can arise in patients with a history of atopic dermatitis or other skin conditions. The other options do not fit the clinical presentation or histopathology results. Disseminated granuloma annulare (option A) typically presents with discrete, flesh-colored papules, not the diffuse erythematous papules and plaques seen in this patient. Erythrodermic sarcoidosis (option B) is a severe form of sarcoidosis that can cause erythematous plaques and papules, but it is typically associated with systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, and weight loss, which are not present in this patient. Tuberculid (option D) is a rare condition that can cause erythematous papules and plaques, but it is typically associated with a history of tuberculosis exposure or infection, which is not mentioned in the patient's history.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as the slow-growing nature of the nodule, its location on the foot, and the absence of purulent drainage, suggest a benign rather than an infectious process. Additionally, the patient's history of exposure to tuberculosis and recent completion of isoniazid treatment make cutaneous tuberculosis (option B) less likely. The patient's history of HIV and hepatitis B increase the likelihood of a rare skin condition such as botryomycosis (option A). However, the absence of warmth, drainage, or lymphadenopathy and the presence of eosinophilic material surrounding small cocci on biopsy (option C) support the diagnosis of digital mucous cyst. Foreign-body reaction (option D) is unlikely given the absence of a foreign body and the patient's medical history.

Answer: C 
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of muscular weakness, hyperlordosis, and difficulty walking, as well as the fact that his condition improves during asthma attacks, suggest that he may have seronegative myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder that affects the neuromuscular junction, leading to muscle weakness and fatigue. The patient's history of asthma and the fact that his symptoms improve during asthma attacks suggest that he may have an autoimmune disorder. Additionally, the patient's negative results for acetylcholinesterase antibodies, which are commonly found in patients with myasthenia gravis, support this diagnosis. Pompe disease, spinal muscular atrophy, and Becker muscular dystrophy are all genetic disorders that affect muscle strength and function, but they do not fit the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory results.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of bilateral hip pain, acanthosis nigricans, dry skin, Tanner stage II breasts, and nonpitting edema of her hands are consistent with hypothyroidism. The patient's family history, with hypothyroidism in the father, maternal great-grandmother, and maternal grandmother, also supports this diagnosis. Hypothyroidism can cause slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE), which is evident in the patient's radiographs. Therefore, it is important to consider the potential underlying condition of hypothyroidism prior to undertaking definitive surgical correction of the hips.

The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and family history. Hyponatremia (A) is a condition where the concentration of sodium in the blood is abnormally low, which is not related to the patient's symptoms or family history. Diabetes mellitus (B) is a condition where the body cannot properly regulate blood sugar levels, which is also not related to the patient's symptoms or family history. Fatty liver disease (D) is a condition where there is an abnormal accumulation of fat in the liver, which is not related to the patient's symptoms or family history.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of chest pain and ECG changes, along with the absence of traditional atherosclerosis risk factors and the recent emotional stress of her daughter's death, suggests that the patient may have Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, also known as stress cardiomyopathy or broken heart syndrome. This condition is often diagnosed by excluding other potential causes of chest pain, such as myocarditis or ischemia. Therefore, the next step would be to perform a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to rule out myocarditis vs ischemia, which would help to confirm the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of recurrent tonsillitis and difficulty swallowing, along with the physical examination findings of 2+ cryptic tonsils and a lobular mass extending from the inferior pole of the right tonsil, suggest a diagnosis of a tonsillar mass. The patient's history of infectious mononucleosis and negative review of systems for weight loss, fevers, and malaise also support this diagnosis. The patient's age and the absence of cervical lymphadenopathy further support a diagnosis of a benign tonsillar mass.

The histopathologic findings of a polypoid structure composed of a fibrovascular core covered by stratified squamous epithelium, with a subepithelial band of lymphoid tissue and lymphatic channels accentuated by D2-40 antibody, are consistent with a diagnosis of a lymphangiomatous polyp. This diagnosis is supported by the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, as well as the absence of cellular atypia on histopathology.

The other options, fibroepithelial polyp, lymphangioma, and juvenile angiofibroma, are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and histopathologic findings. Fibroepithelial polyps are typically smaller and more pedunculated than the mass described in this case, and do not have a subepithelial band of lymphoid tissue. Lymphangioma is a rare benign tumor of lymphatic vessels that can occur in the head and neck, but is typically larger and more nodular than the mass described in this case. Juvenile angiofibroma is a rare benign tumor of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses that is typically found in younger patients, but is not typically associated with recurrent tonsillitis or a tonsillar mass.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation, physical examination findings, and histopathological results are consistent with a diagnosis of chondroma. Chondromas are benign cartilaginous tumors that can occur in various parts of the body, including the ear. They are typically slow-growing and may not cause any symptoms other than cosmetic concerns. The patient's age and lack of any significant medical history also support this diagnosis. The histopathological features described, such as the presence of bland spindle cells in a slightly basophilic myxoid matrix without mitotic activity, are also consistent with a diagnosis of chondroma. In contrast, epidermoid and dermoid cysts are typically filled with keratinizing epithelium and have a different histopathological appearance. Solitary cutaneous myxoma is a rare benign tumor that can occur in the skin, but it typically has a different clinical presentation and histopathological features than what is described in this case. Therefore, option C, chondroma, is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's elevated serum calcium level and significantly elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) level are consistent with hyperparathyroidism. The technetium Tc 99m sestamibi SPECT/CT scan identified a lesion in the location of the right inferior parathyroid gland, which is consistent with a parathyroid adenoma or carcinoma. The associated lytic bone lesions of the left mandibular ramus, left scapula, and C5 vertebra are also consistent with parathyroid carcinoma, as they are likely metastases from the parathyroid tumor. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is parathyroid carcinoma.

Multiple myeloma (option B) is a possibility, as it can also cause hypercalcemia and bone lesions. However, the absence of abdominal pain, dysuria, anxiety, lethargy, and constipation, as well as the lack of palpable thyroid nodules or cervical lymphadenopathy, makes multiple myeloma less likely.

Primary bone tumor (option C) is unlikely, as the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are more consistent with hyperparathyroidism.

Osteitis fibrosa cystica (option D) is a rare condition that is associated with hyperparathyroidism, but it is not a primary bone tumor. Therefore, it is not the most likely diagnosis in this case.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of dysphonia, abnormal laryngeal examination results, and the presence of two laryngeal lesions, one in the postcricoid interarytenoid region and one at the anterior commissure, are consistent with a diagnosis of multifocal granular cell tumor. The patient's age and the absence of stridor or shortness of breath also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the histopathologic examination results, which showed mucosal infiltration by a monotonous population of cells with round nuclei and abundant granular cytoplasm, are consistent with a diagnosis of granular cell tumor. Finally, the negative staining for epithelial, muscle, endothelial, and glial cell immunohistologic markers supports the diagnosis of a benign tumor such as granular cell tumor.

Answer: C. Esophageal bronchus.
Explanation: The CT image shows a bronchopulmonary malformation, specifically an esophageal bronchus, which is a rare congenital anomaly. It appears as a tubular structure arising from the esophagus and connecting to the trachea, which can cause respiratory symptoms such as choking, desaturation, and recurrent pneumonia, as seen in this case. The patient's history of polyhydramnios and gestational diabetes may also suggest a genetic predisposition to this condition. Therefore, option C is the most likely diagnosis.

Option A, pulmonary sequestration, is a rare congenital lung malformation where a portion of lung tissue is not connected to the trachea and bronchi. It can cause respiratory symptoms, but it would not explain the tubular structure seen in the CT image.

Option B, congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation, is a rare lung malformation that can cause respiratory symptoms, but it typically appears as a cystic mass on imaging, rather than a tubular structure.

Option D, tracheoesophageal fistula, is a rare congenital anomaly that connects the trachea and esophagus, but it would not explain the tubular structure seen in the CT image.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's recurrent orbital pain and new-onset cranial neuropathies suggest a possible relapse of the sino-orbital infection. The fact that the MRI showed increased apical enhancement and the patient's history of negative workup for various diseases, including sarcoidosis and IgG4-related disease, suggest that the infection is likely the cause of the patient's symptoms. Initiating broad-spectrum IV antibacterials would be the appropriate next step in managing the patient's condition. Steroid-sparing immunomodulators may be considered later if the patient does not respond to antibiotics or if there are signs of immune-mediated disease. Repeating IV methylprednisolone or biopsy of the orbital apex and sinuses may not address the underlying infection and may not be necessary at this time.

Answer: C
Explanation:
The patient has developed a hemorrhagic Descemet membrane detachment after canaloplasty, which suggests that there is bleeding in the Schlemm canal. In this scenario, it would be appropriate to perform an alteplase washout with an air bubble to help clear the blood and reduce the risk of further bleeding. Alteplase is a thrombolytic agent that can help break down blood clots and promote drainage. By performing an alteplase washout with an air bubble, the physicians can help to clear the blood in the interface and potentially improve the patient's visual acuity.

Option A, continuing to observe, may not be the best course of action as it may allow the bleeding to continue and potentially worsen the patient's vision. Option B, a saline washout with an air bubble, may not be effective in clearing the blood in the interface and may not address the underlying cause of the bleeding. Option D, laser Descemet membrane membranotomy, may be a more invasive procedure that may not be necessary at this stage.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient presents with acute eye pain, blurry vision, and photophobia in the right eye, which began after prolonged face-down positioning. The patient's history of Marfan syndrome and dislocated lenses increases the likelihood of a lens-related issue. The patient's right eye exhibits conjunctival injection, corneal stromal edema, and a shallowed anterior chamber, indicating that the lens is causing irritation and inflammation. The lens is also protruding through the pupil, which may be causing further irritation and discomfort.

Given these findings, the most appropriate next step would be to instill atropine and IOP-lowering drops and place the patient in a supine position. Atropine will help to dilate the pupil and reduce inflammation, while IOP-lowering drops will help to reduce the intraocular pressure, which is elevated in the right eye. Placing the patient in a supine position will help to reduce the pressure on the eye and alleviate discomfort.

Performing laser iridotomy (Option A) may be considered in cases of acute angle-closure glaucoma, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a lens-related issue. Performing an emergent pars plana vitrectomy/lensectomy (Option B) may be necessary in cases of severe lens dislocation or damage, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as the patient's symptoms can be managed with less invasive measures. Instilling pilocarpine and IOP-lowering drops (Option D) may be considered in cases of glaucoma, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as the patient's symptoms are more consistent with a lens-related issue.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical findings suggest a possible bleeding disorder, and the patient's recent surgery and young age make it unlikely that the hemorrhages are due to hypertension or diabetic retinopathy. A complete blood cell count and coagulation testing would help to identify any abnormalities in the patient's blood clotting mechanisms and help guide further management. Oral and topical corticosteroids (option B) may be used to treat inflammation, but they would not address the underlying cause of the hemorrhages. Plasmapheresis for hyperviscosity syndrome (option C) is not indicated, as there is no evidence of hyperviscosity or a thrombotic event. Fluorescein angiography (option D) may be used to evaluate the retinal circulation, but it would not provide information about the patient's coagulation status.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of sudden onset of cramps and abdominal pain, along with the presence of a hypodense mass causing a small-bowel obstruction, are consistent with a carcinoid tumor. Carcinoid tumors are rare, slow-growing tumors that can occur in the small bowel and are characterized by their ability to produce and release excessive amounts of serotonin and other hormones, leading to symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and flushing. The presence of the capsule endoscopy in a proximal dilated loop of the small bowel suggests that the tumor is located in the proximal small bowel, which is consistent with the typical location of carcinoid tumors. The patient's history of hypochromic microcytic anemia, which is a type of anemia caused by chronic blood loss, also supports the diagnosis of a carcinoid tumor, as these tumors can cause chronic bleeding due to their ability to produce and release histamine. The other options, small-bowel adenocarcinoma, lymphoma of the small bowel, and gastrointestinal stromal tumor of the small bowel, can also cause small-bowel obstruction, but are less likely given the patient's symptoms and medical history.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of exacerbating right lower quadrant and epigastric abdominal pain, along with the physical examination findings of localized tenderness and guarding in the epigastric region and right lower quadrant, and hyperactive bowel sounds, are consistent with acute appendicitis. The patient's history of previous hospitalizations for nonspecific abdominal pain during infancy and the negative results of a plain radiograph of his abdomen also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the ultrasonographic findings of thickening of the cecal wall and a hypoechoic area with blurred margins in the right lower quadrant are consistent with retrocecal acute appendicitis. Therefore, option B, Retrocecal acute appendicitis, is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive generalized weakness, slowed speech, and focal right-handed weakness, along with the physical examination findings of an 8-cm left parietal mass that was tender to palpation, suggest a possible diagnosis of meningioma. This is supported by the imaging findings of a large enhancing left frontal-parietal mass extending both extracranially and intracranially into the superior sagittal sinus, with left frontal, parietal, and temporal bone involvement, and left dural thickening. Meningioma is a type of tumor that arises from the meninges, the protective coverings of the brain and spinal cord, and can cause symptoms by compressing or displacing surrounding brain tissue. The involvement of the superior sagittal sinus and the presence of vasogenic edema and associated mass effect also support this diagnosis. The patient's age and the rapid growth of the mass also increase the likelihood of a meningioma. The other options, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, glioblastoma multiforme, and meningeal sarcoma, can also present with similar symptoms and imaging findings, but are less likely given the patient's age and the specific imaging findings. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is meningioma.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with herpes zoster, also known as shingles. The grouped vesicles on an erythematous base in a discrete area of the sole of the right foot are characteristic of the rash associated with herpes zoster. It is important to initiate antiviral therapy with valacyclovir as soon as possible to reduce the severity and duration of the rash, as well as to reduce the risk of postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), a common complication of herpes zoster that can cause persistent pain in the affected area long after the rash has healed. Obtaining blood cultures (option A) would not be necessary in this case, as herpes zoster is a viral infection and not a bacterial infection. Prescribing an oral antihistamine agent (option C) may help with itching or pruritus, but it would not be effective in treating the underlying viral infection. Prescribing a topical corticosteroid cream (option D) may help with inflammation and itching, but it would not be effective in treating the viral infection and may even prolong the duration of the rash.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of fever and pustular rash, along with the absence of any other likely causes, suggest a diagnosis of acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). This condition is known to be associated with the use of certain medications, including ibuprofen, which the patient took a week prior to the onset of symptoms. The patient's recent use of ibuprofen and the absence of any other likely causes support this diagnosis. Topical steroids are commonly used to treat AGEP, which is why option A is the best answer. Option B, infliximab therapy, is not typically used to treat AGEP and may not be effective. Option C, oral cephalexin therapy, is not appropriate for this condition as it is an antibiotic and there is no evidence of a bacterial infection. Option D, obtaining a human immunodeficiency virus immunoassay, is not relevant to the patient's symptoms or diagnosis.

Explanation: Given the patient's symptoms of headache, gait imbalance, coordination difficulties, and personality changes, along with the physical examination findings of hyperreflexia, bilateral shoulder weakness, and right-sided pronator drift, the most likely diagnosis is a central nervous system (CNS) mass lesion. The patient's history of smoking marijuana and multiple male sexual partners suggests a possible diagnosis of CNS toxoplasmosis. The negative serologic testing for Toxoplasma gondii IgG does not rule out the diagnosis, as the patient may have been recently infected or have a false negative result. A lumbar puncture for examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) would be the next appropriate step to help confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.

Answer: B
Explanation: Methimazole, a medication used to treat hyperthyroidism, can cause a rare but potentially severe side effect known as methimazole-induced vasculitis. This condition is characterized by inflammation of the blood vessels, leading to symptoms such as painful ulcerative lesions, swelling, and fever. The patient's history of Graves disease and recent use of methimazole suggest that this could be the underlying cause of her symptoms. The presence of pitting edema and multiple discrete, round, dry ulcers with central eschars and raised borders on her bilateral lower extremities are consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's elevated levels of C-reactive protein and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate support the diagnosis of an inflammatory condition. While polyarteritis nodosa (option A) and pyoderma gangrenosum (option D) can also present with similar symptoms, the patient's history and laboratory results suggest that methimazole-induced vasculitis is the most likely diagnosis. Ecthyma (option C) is a less likely diagnosis as it typically presents with more widespread and severe skin lesions.

Additionally, the patient's history of photosensitivity during childhood only, and the absence of other symptoms such as blistering, angioedema, dysphagia, hoarseness, dyspnea, or weight loss, are consistent with colloid milium. Erythropoietic protoporphyria can cause photosensitivity and skin manifestations, but the patient's history and physical examination findings do not support this diagnosis. Nodular amyloidosis can cause skin deposits, but the patient's age and absence of other symptoms such as weight loss, fever, or lymphadenopathy make it less likely. Lipoid proteinosis can cause skin lesions, but the patient's history and physical examination findings do not support this diagnosis.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including the widespread distribution of vesicles and bullae on the hands, feet, and face, are consistent with erythema multiforme. The fact that the patient had recently been treated with azithromycin and developed few small, pruritic blisters on the hands and feet, suggests that the medication may have triggered the condition. Additionally, the patient's history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and use of cyclosporine may have contributed to the development of the condition. Disseminated zoster (option B) is less likely since the patient does not have a history of shingles or recent viral infection. Atypical hand-foot-mouth disease (option A) is also less likely since the patient's age and symptoms do not fit the typical presentation of this condition. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis (option D) is unlikely since there is no evidence of systemic vasculitis or hematuria in the patient's urine output.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss, along with the absence of myoclonus or parkinsonism, suggest a diagnosis of adult-onset cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, pes cavus, optic atrophy, and sensorineural hearing loss syndrome (AOCA). This syndrome is characterized by a slow progression of cerebellar ataxia, areflexia, and sensorineural hearing loss, often accompanied by pes cavus and optic atrophy. The patient's lack of family history, absence of myoclonus or parkinsonism, and normal MRI and CSF results support this diagnosis.

The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and findings:

A. Paraneoplastic cerebellar ataxia is a rare condition that occurs in association with certain cancers, such as breast, lung, or ovarian cancer. The patient's lack of cancer history and negative workup for malignancy make this diagnosis unlikely.

C. Wernicke encephalopathy is a neurological disorder caused by thiamine deficiency, typically seen in alcoholics or individuals with malnutrition. The patient's history of social drinking and lack of nutritional deficiencies make this diagnosis less likely.

D. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a rare, degenerative brain disorder caused by a prion. The patient's lack of rapid neurological deterioration, absence of myoclonus or ataxia, and normal MRI and EEG results make this diagnosis unlikely.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive depression, bradyphrenia, dyscalculia, and fatigue, as well as the physical examination findings of abulic behavior and Mini-Mental State Examination score of 24 of 30, are consistent with a diagnosis of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy. The patient's family history, with a mother who died at a young age from a rapidly progressive dementia, also supports this diagnosis. The patient's MRI findings of scattered small foci of T2 hyperintensity in the white matter, affecting the corpus callosum, bifrontal, and biparietal regions, and associated with bifrontal and bitemporal atrophy, are also consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the absence of any other medical or neurological conditions that could explain the patient's symptoms and examination findings, supports the diagnosis of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy.

The other options, Adrenoleukodystrophy (B), Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (C), and Hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids (D), do not fit the patient's symptoms and examination findings as well as option A.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including the diffuse truncal rash, numerous blue-gray macules on the trunk, and pink papules, are consistent with leukemia cutis. Leukemia cutis is a rare condition characterized by the infiltration of the skin by malignant cells, typically seen in patients with hematologic malignancies. The patient's history of congenital heart disease, seizures, and developmental delay, as well as the presence of a central dome-shaped pink papule in some of the blue-gray macules, also support this diagnosis. The patient's exposure to varicella-zoster virus through his cousin's recent diagnosis of chickenpox increases the likelihood of this diagnosis. The patient's mother's pruritic pink papules on her forearms, which she suspected were from sand fleas, may also be a sign of a systemic illness. The patient's recent treatment with vancomycin and clindamycin may have contributed to the development of the rash, but it is unlikely to be the sole cause of the widespread skin lesions. Therefore, option C, leukemia cutis, is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of exercise-induced syncope, along with the findings of first-degree AV block, borderline right axis deviation, and right bundle branch block on the resting ECG, suggest a possible diagnosis of a cardiac conduction disorder. The abrupt decrease in heart rate during exercise and the presence of AV block suggest that the patient may have a condition that can cause bradycardia and/or asystole during exercise, such as a sick sinus syndrome or a conduction disorder. In this case, placing a dual chamber pacemaker (option C) would be an appropriate next step in management. This would help to regulate the patient's heart rhythm and prevent symptomatic bradycardia or asystole during exercise. Obtaining tilt table testing (option A) may also be considered to further evaluate the patient's syncope, but it would not address the underlying conduction disorder. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (option B) may be useful in certain cases, but it is not necessary at this point in the patient's management. Implanting a loop recorder (option D) may also be considered, but it would not provide immediate relief of the patient's symptoms and would not address the underlying conduction disorder.

Explanation: McCune-Albright syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of various tissues, including bones, skin, and endocrine system. The clinical features described in the case, such as nasal congestion, limping, and bony changes, are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's history of behavioral changes and discontinuation of montelukast also support this diagnosis, as McCune-Albright syndrome is known to be associated with cognitive and behavioral abnormalities. Additionally, the radiographic findings of extensive bony changes in the long bones and skull, as well as the presence of macules with irregular borders, are consistent with the characteristic bony lesions seen in McCune-Albright syndrome.

The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and findings as well. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (Option A) is a disorder that affects the immune system and can cause bony lesions, but it typically presents with a different set of symptoms, such as fever, fatigue, and skin rash. Juvenile Paget disease (Option C) is a rare condition that affects bone growth and can cause bony deformities, but it typically presents with a different set of symptoms, such as bone pain, swelling, and deformity. Ossifying fibromas (Option D) are benign bone tumors that can cause bony changes, but they typically present with a different set of symptoms, such as painless swelling or mass in the affected bone.

Answer: D
Explanation:
The correct diagnosis is D: Rhabdomyomatous mesenchymal hamartoma.

The clinical presentation of a nasal midline mass in an infant, along with the histopathologic findings of a disordered admixture of mature skeletal muscle, mature adipose tissue, and skin adnexal structures, are consistent with a diagnosis of rhabdomyomatous mesenchymal hamartoma. This is a rare benign tumor that typically occurs in the head and neck region of infants and children.

Glioma (option A) is a malignant tumor that arises from glial cells and typically affects the central nervous system. While gliomas can occur in the head and neck region, the clinical presentation and histopathologic findings in this case do not support this diagnosis.

Neuromuscular hamartoma (option B) is a rare benign tumor that consists of a mixture of mature neurons and muscle cells. While it can occur in the head and neck region, the presence of skin adnexal structures and the absence of any evidence of neural tissue in the histopathologic images argue against this diagnosis.

Rhabdomyosarcoma (option C) is a malignant tumor that arises from immature muscle cells. While it can occur in the head and neck region, the presence of mature skeletal muscle and adipose tissue in the histopathologic images argues against this diagnosis.

Therefore, the correct diagnosis is D: Rhabdomyomatous mesenchymal hamartoma.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of a hoarse voice for a year, along with the physical examination findings of bilateral true vocal fold lesions, and the histopathologic findings of submucosal amorphous eosinophilic material, are consistent with a diagnosis of laryngeal gout. The patient's history of gout and exposure to Agent Orange also support this diagnosis. The negative Congo red stain result rules out amyloidosis. Squamous cell carcinoma is unlikely given the patient's age and lack of significant smoking history. Rheumatoid nodules are not typically found in the larynx and would not explain the patient's vocal fold lesions. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is laryngeal gout.

Answer: B
Explanation: A dermoid cyst is a type of benign growth that can occur in the floor of the mouth, as seen in this case. The patient's symptoms of progressive swelling in the sublingual area, difficulty swallowing, and the physical examination findings of soft, nontender swelling of the floor of the mouth bilaterally, are all consistent with a dermoid cyst. Additionally, the CT imaging findings of a cystic nonenhancing mass centered in the root of the tongue, with elevation of the oral aspect of the tongue and some downward displacement of the floor of the mouth, are also consistent with a dermoid cyst. The fact that the sublingual glands were compressed but otherwise appeared normal, and the sublingual spaces were effaced, further supports this diagnosis. The patient's history of hypertension and non-compliance with medication may also suggest a possible association with the development of the dermoid cyst. Therefore, option B (Dermoid cyst) is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: D
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and test results indicate that he may have a retinal melanoma, a type of eye cancer. The lesion's location, size, shape, and elevation, as well as the absence of retinal traction, RPE atrophy, macular edema, retinal exudation, or subretinal fluid, are all consistent with this diagnosis. A staging workup, such as total-body positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging, is necessary to determine the extent of the cancer and develop an appropriate treatment plan. Genetic testing may also be useful in determining the genetic characteristics of the tumor, but it is not the most appropriate next step. Observation with normal follow-up is not appropriate given the potential malignancy of the lesion. Surgical excision and histopathologic analysis may be necessary if the lesion is indeed a melanoma, but this would be done after a thorough staging workup has been completed. Therefore, the correct answer is D: Staging workup (eg, total-body positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging).

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest bilateral optic nerve head changes, which could be due to various inflammatory and infectious processes. Serum and urine testing (option C) would help identify any underlying conditions that may be causing the changes in the optic nerve head. This is the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation, as it can help guide further management and treatment.

Option A, observation with close follow-up, may be appropriate for some cases of bilateral optic nerve head changes, but it may not be sufficient to diagnose and treat any underlying conditions that may be causing the changes.

Option B, lumbar puncture, may be necessary in some cases to diagnose conditions such as meningitis or encephalitis, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as there are no signs of meningism or other conditions that would require a lumbar puncture.

Option D, orbital and brain magnetic resonance imaging, may be necessary in some cases to evaluate the extent of any orbital or intracranial disease, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as there are no signs of orbital or intracranial disease.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and signs, including recurrent central corneal erosions, subconjunctival hyperemia, and meibomian gland dysfunction, suggest a diagnosis of ocular rosacea. The patient's history of basal cell carcinoma and recent onset of blepharoptosis also support this diagnosis. A biopsy of the eyelid would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other potential causes of ocular rosacea, such as Demodex infestation or blepharitis. Initiating treatment with doxycycline (option A) or increasing the frequency of tobramycin-dexamethasone ointment (option B) may help manage symptoms, but a biopsy is necessary for a definitive diagnosis. Repairing the ptosis (option D) may also be necessary, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, including unilateral optic nerve edema with preserved visual function, suggest a possible inflammatory or infectious cause. The presence of a skin rash on the upper arms and trunk, which preceded the onset of visual symptoms, suggests a possible systemic inflammatory or infectious disorder. Therefore, it is appropriate to order bloodwork (complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, VDRL, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and antinuclear antibody) to evaluate for possible systemic inflammation or infection. Additionally, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits should be ordered to evaluate for any intracranial or orbital abnormalities that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. Molecular testing for Leber hereditary optic neuropathy may also be considered, given the patient's age and the presence of optic nerve edema, but it is less likely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms given the presence of a skin rash and normal visual acuity. Performing a lumbar puncture with opening pressure measurement and cerebrospinal fluid analysis may also be considered, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as it is more invasive and may not provide as much information as the other diagnostic tests. Computed tomography of the orbits is not likely to provide useful information in this case, as it is not sensitive for detecting optic nerve edema or inflammation.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of dysphagia and heartburn, along with the physical examination findings and diagnostic imaging results, suggest a diagnosis of an inclusion cyst. An inclusion cyst is a type of benign tumor that arises from the inclusion of a portion of the mucous membrane into the muscular layer of the esophagus. The cystic lesion is located within the submucosa of the distal esophagus and does not invade nearby structures, which is consistent with the endoscopic ultrasonography findings. The patient's symptoms of dysphagia and heartburn are likely due to the compression of the esophageal lumen by the cyst. The diagnosis of an inclusion cyst is supported by the normal mucosal biopsies and the absence of any other abnormalities in the liver, gallbladder, and pancreas. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive supraclavicular, facial, and mandibular swelling, pain with chewing, and weight loss, along with the physical examination findings of craniofacial deformity, left facial preauricular swelling, and a firm, adherent, immobile right supraclavicular mass, are consistent with a diagnosis of adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC). ACC is a rare type of cancer that can arise in the salivary glands, and it is known to have a high propensity for perineural invasion and metastasis. The patient's history of sarcoidosis increases the likelihood of this diagnosis, as ACC is known to occur in association with sarcoidosis. The imaging findings of a lobulated paramandibular mass extending into the left masticator space and infratemporal fossa, with frank erosion of the left mandibular condyle, and the presence of enlarged lymph nodes, also support this diagnosis. The right supraclavicular mass and metabolically active lymphadenopathy noted on positron emission tomography further support the diagnosis of ACC. Squamous cell carcinoma (Answer A) is a possible diagnosis, but it is less likely given the patient's history of sarcoidosis and the imaging findings. Chondrosarcoma (Answer B) is a rare type of cancer that arises in the cartilage and is not typically associated with sarcoidosis. Lymphoma (Answer D) is also a possible diagnosis, but it is less likely given the patient's history of sarcoidosis and the imaging findings.

Answer: D: Empirically treat patient and close contacts with dapsone.
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, including the loss of eyebrows and eyelashes, scaly plaque, and lymphadenopathy, suggest a diagnosis of leprosy. Dapsone is a medication commonly used to treat leprosy, and it is important to treat not only the patient but also close contacts to prevent further spread of the disease. Therefore, option D is the most appropriate next step in management.

Option A, performing a biopsy of the skin lesion, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis, but it is not the most urgent step in management.

Option B, checking rapid plasma reagin, thyroid-stimulating hormone level, and lead level, may be useful in ruling out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, but it is not directly related to the suspected diagnosis of leprosy.

Option C, empirically treating with a topical steroid, may help with skin symptoms, but it is not a specific treatment for leprosy and may not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with Palisaded neutrophilic and granulomatous dermatitis (PNGD). PNGD is a rare condition characterized by the development of neutrophilic and granulomatous inflammation in the skin, often in response to exposure to certain chemicals or infections. The arcuate to circinate erythematous to violaceous plaques and focal areas of ulceration with overlying scale-crust on the patient's thighs are consistent with the characteristic skin lesions of PNGD. Additionally, the patient's occupation at a horse stable and frequent horseback riding may suggest exposure to certain environmental triggers that could contribute to the development of PNGD.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, along with the negative fungal and bacterial cultures, suggest an atypical mycobacterial infection. The presence of pitting edema and negative Homans sign bilaterally for deep vein thrombosis also support this diagnosis. The elevated rheumatoid factor and history of RA further suggest a possible association with mycobacterial infection. The punch biopsy specimen showed granulomas, which are consistent with mycobacterial infection. Therefore, option C, atypical mycobacterial infection, is the most likely diagnosis.

Option A, blastomycosis, is less likely as it typically presents with larger ulcers and a history of exposure to the fungus Blastomyces dermatitidis. Option B, pyoderma gangrenosum, is also less likely as it typically presents with larger ulcers and a history of neutropenia. Option D, ecthyma gangrenosum, is unlikely as it typically presents with smaller ulcers and a history of trauma.

Answer: C
Explanation: The clinical presentation of a smooth-surfaced, cobblestoned plaque that is asymptomatic, along with the histopathological findings of a diffuse infiltrate of pale eosinophilic material with prominent clefts, is consistent with a diagnosis of plantar cerebriform collagenoma. This condition is a rare benign tumor that typically affects the plantar surface of the foot and is characterized by a distinctive cobblestone-like appearance. The patient's history of diabetes and numbness in both legs in a stocking distribution, attributed to diabetic neuropathy, also support this diagnosis.

The other options do not fit the clinical presentation and histopathological findings. Pseudolymphoma (option A) is a condition that mimics lymphoma but lacks the systemic symptoms and is usually asymptomatic. Elephantiasis nostras verrucosa (option B) is a condition characterized by verrucous lesions on the legs, but it is not associated with a cobblestone-like appearance.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of bilateral lower extremity edema, ecchymoses, and arthralgias, along with the presence of hemorrhagic gingivitis, petechiae, and microcytic anemia, are consistent with a diagnosis of scurvy. Scurvy is a vitamin C deficiency that can cause capillary fragility, leading to ecchymoses and petechiae, as well as bone pain and arthralgias. The patient's history of recent onset of necrotizing gingivostomatitis and the absence of other signs of infection or inflammation support the diagnosis of scurvy. The patient's low albumin level and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate also suggest a nutritional deficiency. While leukemia, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, and granulomatosis with polyangiitis can also cause ecchymoses and arthralgias, the patient's history and laboratory results do not support these diagnoses.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, constant in the hypogastric region, with no radiation, and absence of bowel movements for 5 days, suggest a possible mechanical obstruction. The absence of abnormal intestinal air-fluid levels or free peritoneal air on the CT scan supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of passing gas normally suggests that the obstruction is likely proximal to the rectum. An internal hernia is a possible cause of mechanical obstruction, and it can occur when a portion of the intestine slides into another portion, creating a blockage. This diagnosis is more likely than gastrointestinal obstruction due to adhesion band (A), as adhesions are less common in the absence of previous abdominal surgery or inflammation. Body packing (C) is unlikely as the patient did not report any history of substance abuse or addiction, and there were no signs of abdominal distension or guarding. Fecal impaction due to opium addiction (D) is also unlikely as the patient denied substance abuse or addiction, and there were no signs of constipation or fecal impaction on physical examination.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's history of rapid growth, pain, and bleeding, along with the multilobulated and fungating appearance of the lesion, are consistent with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The positive immunohistochemistry results for S-100, MART-1, and HMB-45 also support this diagnosis, as SCCs are known to express these markers. Additionally, the presence of a palpable mass in the left axilla suggests possible metastasis, which is consistent with the aggressive nature of SCC.

The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and clinical findings as well. Cavernous lymphangioma (A) is a rare benign tumor that typically presents as a painless, slowly growing mass, and does not have the same rapid growth and bleeding characteristics as SCC. Nodular basal cell carcinoma (B) is a type of skin cancer that typically presents as a small, shiny, nodular lesion, and does not have the same multilobulated and fungating appearance as SCC. Nodular melanoma (D) is a type of skin cancer that can present with rapid growth and bleeding, but it typically has a different appearance, with a darkly pigmented, irregularly shaped lesion, and does not typically express S-100, MART-1, or HMB-45.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive dyspnea and fatigue, along with the findings of a dilated pulmonary artery and pulmonary hypertension on the CT pulmonary angiogram, suggest that the patient has significant lung disease. The diffuse narrowing of the left main coronary artery at its origin, as seen on coronary angiography, suggests that the patient has coronary artery disease. The administration of intracoronary nitroglycerine with no change in angiographic appearance of the left main coronary artery suggests that the stenosis is likely due to a fixed obstruction rather than spasm. The patient's development of deep ST-segment depressions associated with chest and throat pain, followed by ventricular tachycardia requiring cardioversion and intravenous amiodarone and lidocaine, suggests that the patient is experiencing an acute coronary syndrome. Given the patient's unstable condition and the need for emergent intervention, emergent stenting of the left main coronary artery would be the most appropriate next step.

The presence of hematoma of the left true vocal fold and laryngeal surface of the epiglottis, as shown on flexible laryngoscopy, also supports this diagnosis. A ruptured vocal fold hemangioma (option A) would not explain the patient's symptoms of neck pain and odynophagia, and there is no evidence of a laryngocele (option B) or traumatic intubation (option D). Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a thyroid cartilage fracture (option C).

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as a cervical tracheal mass and absence of dyspnea, hoarseness, dysphagia, hemoptysis, or chest pain, are consistent with a glomus tumor. Glomus tumors are rare, benign tumors that originate from the glomus cells that line the tracheal submucosal glands. They typically present with a slow-growing mass in the neck or throat and do not cause respiratory symptoms unless they are large enough to obstruct the airway. The smooth hypervascular mass arising from the posterior membranous trachea, as seen on flexible fiber-optic nasolaryngoscopy, is also consistent with a glomus tumor. The histopathologic images shown in the Figure, B-D, demonstrate a typical glomus tumor with a characteristic "salt and pepper" appearance.

The patient's positive fecal occult blood test and iron deficiency anemia indicate the presence of bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract, which could be caused by a polyp. The lesion observed during endoscopy, described as a necrotic polypoid lesion protruding from the esophagogastric junction, is consistent with a fibrovascular polyp. Additionally, the patient's history of chronic renal failure and diabetes increases the likelihood of this diagnosis, as fibrovascular polyps are more common in patients with these conditions. The patient's lack of symptoms such as dysphagia, stomach pain, or stool irregularity also supports this diagnosis, as fibrovascular polyps are typically asymptomatic.

Answer: B 
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), which is a blockage of the main vein that drains blood from the retina. The presence of mild venous engorgement, widespread peripheral dot-blot retinal hemorrhages, and delayed venous filling on fluorescein angiography support this diagnosis. Performing panretinal photocoagulation (Option B) would help to reduce the risk of further vision loss by reducing the amount of blood flow to the affected area and preventing further hemorrhages. It is not necessary to obtain a carotid Doppler (Option C) or refer to cardiology (Option D) at this time, as the patient's medical history and examination findings do not suggest a significant cardiovascular component to the CRVO. Observation (Option A) may be appropriate for some cases of CRVO, but in this case, the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest that treatment is warranted to prevent further vision loss.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's recent-onset bilateral blurred vision, mild photophobia, and normal intraocular pressures suggest a diagnosis of Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy, a genetic disorder that affects the corneal endothelium. The central bilateral stromal edema, Descemet folds, microcystic edema, and endothelial guttae observed on slitlamp examination support this diagnosis. The patient's history of hypertension, asthma, hepatitis C, and essential tremor may also contribute to the development of Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy.

Given the patient's symptoms and examination findings, the best course of action would be to observe the patient and monitor her condition closely, as Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy can progress slowly over time. Therefore, option C (Observe) is the correct answer.

Option A (Bilateral Descemet stripping endothelial keratoplasty) may be considered for advanced cases of Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as the patient's symptoms and examination findings do not indicate advanced disease.

Option B (Corneal topography) may be useful in evaluating the patient's corneal shape and identifying any irregular astigmatism, but it is not the most relevant test at this point in the patient's management.

Option D (Discontinue treatment with amantadine) is not relevant to the patient's current condition, as there is no indication that the patient's medication is contributing to her symptoms.

Answer: B
Explanation: Given the patient's history of sarcoidosis and the presence of a peripherally enhancing mass in the medial periorbital region, it is likely that the mass is related to sarcoidosis. The patient's symptoms of pain, redness, and swelling in the affected region, as well as the tender and firm nature of the mass, are consistent with a sarcoid granuloma. Additionally, the patient's history of pseudophakia and proliferative diabetic retinopathy in both eyes, as well as her previous pars plana vitrectomy and panretinal photocoagulation, suggest that she has a history of chronic eye disease, which could also be related to sarcoidosis. Therefore, it would be appropriate to perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits and maxillofacial region to further evaluate the mass and determine its relationship to the patient's sarcoidosis. This would help guide further management and potential treatment of the mass.

Answer: C
Explanation: The clinical image and biopsy results presented in the case suggest a diagnosis of hypertrophic lichen planus (HLP). HLP is a rare variant of lichen planus that is characterized by thick, hyperkeratotic plaques on the skin. The biopsy results show a band-like lymphocytic infiltration, which is consistent with HLP. The patient's history of cancer and treatment with immune-checkpoint inhibitors, such as pembrolizumab, may also support this diagnosis, as HLP has been associated with cancer and immune dysregulation.

The other options are less likely diagnoses based on the clinical presentation and biopsy results. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a possibility, but the biopsy results do not support this diagnosis. Plaque psoriasis is also unlikely, as the plaques are not typical of psoriasis and there is no history of psoriasis in the patient. Keratoacanthoma is a rare diagnosis that is characterized by a rapidly growing, keratotic tumor; however, the biopsy results do not support this diagnosis.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as multiple discrete and clustered blue papules on the face and extremities, tender and partially compressible papules, and a cobblestoned appearance, are consistent with a diagnosis of hemangioma. Hemangioma is a benign vascular tumor that can cause pain, especially when compressed. The patient's history of the lesions increasing in size and pain intensity over time also supports this diagnosis. Blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome, venous malformation, and glomuvenous malformation are other vascular malformations that can cause similar symptoms, but they typically have different clinical features and do not match the patient's presentation. Therefore, option C, hemangioma, is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The clinical presentation of multiple facial papules that have been present since childhood, with a medial but asymmetrical distribution on the face, and involvement of the extremities and trunk, is consistent with multiple eruptive dermatofibromas. The fact that the patient's young brother also has similar papular lesions, supports the diagnosis. Dermatofibromas are benign tumors that are usually solitary, but can sometimes be multiple and have a familial tendency. The histopathological findings of identical lesions on the face, hands, and back, with a mixture of collagen, elastic fibers, and melanin, are also consistent with dermatofibromas. Therefore, option C, Multiple eruptive dermatofibromas, is the most appropriate diagnosis.

Option A, Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by multiple fibrofolliculomas, trichodiscomas, and acrochordons. Although it can present with multiple facial papules, the distribution of the lesions is typically more widespread and involves the neck, upper limbs, and trunk.

Option B, Hereditary progressive mucinous histiocytosis, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the accumulation of mucin in various organs, including the skin, leading to the formation of papules, nodules, and plaques. However, the distribution of the lesions in this case is not consistent with the typical distribution of hereditary progressive mucinous histiocytosis, which typically involves the face, scalp, and extremities.

Option D, Acral persistent papular mucinosis, is a rare condition characterized by the persistent presence of mucinous papules on the palms, soles, and face. However, the distribution of the lesions in this case is not consistent with acral persistent papular mucinosis, which typically involves the palms, soles, and face.

Answer: B 
Explanation: Paraneoplastic pyoderma gangrenosum (PPG) is a rare autoimmune condition that is associated with an underlying malignancy, most commonly hematologic or lung cancer. The patient's history of lung cancer, recent weight loss, fever, and development of cutaneous ulcers, as well as the positive c-ANCA testing, are all consistent with PPG. The patient's age and medical history, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type 2 diabetes, and chronic kidney disease, also increase the likelihood of this diagnosis. The skin lesions, which are typically painful and have erythematous borders, are also consistent with PPG. While disseminated tuberculosis, disseminated nocardiosis, and granulomatosis with polyangiitis are all possible diagnoses, they are less likely given the patient's history and clinical presentation.

Answer: D
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of acute neck pain progressing to hemiparesis, sensory impairment, and elevated γ-glutamyltransferase level, along with the MRI findings of multiple abnormal signals throughout the brain and a lesion at the level of the fifth cervical vertebra, are consistent with cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). This is a genetic disorder that affects the blood vessels in the brain, leading to recurrent stroke-like episodes, cognitive decline, and various other neurological symptoms. The patient's family history of a brother with a brain lesion excised also supports this diagnosis.

Amyloid angiopathy (option A) is a condition where abnormal proteins accumulate in the walls of blood vessels, leading to degeneration of the brain tissue. While it can cause similar symptoms, it is less likely given the patient's age and lack of a family history of similar conditions.

Multiple cavernous malformations (option B) are abnormalities in the blood vessels that can cause seizures, stroke-like episodes, and other neurological symptoms. However, the patient's MRI findings do not suggest this diagnosis.

Metastatic melanoma (option C) is a type of cancer that spreads from the skin to other parts of the body, including the brain. While it can cause similar symptoms, it is less likely given the patient's age and lack of a history of skin cancer.

Answer: C
Explanation: The appearance of multiple discrete clusters of monomorphic pink to violaceous papulovesicles with surrounding erythema scattered across the left buttock, thigh, and upper calf, some with central punctate hemorrhagic crust, is consistent with a diagnosis of herpes zoster (shingles). The fact that the rash did not bleed, ulcerate, weep, or appear itchy or painful, and the patient did seem uncomfortable when getting dressed, also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the fact that the rash started near the site of the influenza vaccine injection and spread down the left thigh over several days, suggests that the vaccine may have triggered a reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus, which causes herpes zoster.

A microcystic lymphatic malformation (option A) is a congenital malformation of the lymphatic vessels, which can cause fluid-filled cysts to form in the skin and subcutaneous tissue. This diagnosis is unlikely given the sudden onset of the rash and the fact that it is limited to one side of the body.

Eczema herpeticum (option B) is a rare condition in which herpes simplex virus infection causes a widespread eczematous eruption. This diagnosis is unlikely given the absence of known exposure to herpes simplex virus and the fact that the rash is limited to one side of the body.

A hypersensitivity reaction (option D) is an exaggerated response to a substance or stimulus that would normally not cause a reaction. This diagnosis is unlikely given the absence of any known allergens or triggers and the fact that the rash started near the site of the influenza vaccine injection.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of abdominal discomfort, weight loss, night sweats, and leukocytosis, along with the large retroperitoneal mass and splenomegaly, are consistent with lymphoma. The patient's history of smoking and alcohol consumption may also increase the likelihood of a malignant diagnosis. The patient's young age and lack of family history of malignant disease also support this diagnosis. A bone marrow biopsy showing a hypercellular marrow with a myeloid left shift but no increase in blasts or dyspoiesis is consistent with lymphoma. The negative tests for BCR/ABL and peripheral blood JAK2 mutation also support this diagnosis. Adrenocortical carcinoma, liposarcoma, and leiomyosarcoma are less likely given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

Answer: **B** 
Explanation: Internal hernia of the cecum, also known as cecal herniation, occurs when a portion of the cecum protrudes through a defect in the peritoneum and becomes trapped, leading to bowel obstruction. This condition is a rare cause of acute abdominal pain and can be difficult to diagnose. The patient's symptoms of acute-onset, diffuse abdominal pain, nausea, and retching, along with the physical examination findings of a distended cecum in the left upper quadrant, are consistent with internal hernia of the cecum. The absence of peritoneal signs suggests that the hernia is not strangulated. The patient's history of no prior abdominal surgery and no significant medical history also supports this diagnosis. Computed tomographic images of a dilated cecum in the left upper quadrant (arrowhead) (Figure 1) are consistent with internal hernia of the cecum. Cecal volvulus (A) is a possibility, but it is less likely given the absence of peritoneal signs. Intestinal malrotation (C) is a congenital condition that can cause abdominal pain, but it is unlikely in a patient in their 60s without a history of prior abdominal surgery. Midgut volvulus (D) is a possibility, but it is less likely given the absence of peritoneal signs and the patient's age.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with papilledema, which is a sign of increased intracranial pressure. The optic disc edema and loss of the central physiologic cup are also indicative of increased intracranial pressure. It is important to evaluate the patient for a potential intracranial mass or other cause of increased intracranial pressure. B-scan ultrasonography or fundus autofluorescence imaging of optic nerves would be appropriate next steps in the evaluation of this patient. These tests can help to confirm the diagnosis of papilledema and identify any underlying causes, such as a tumor or cerebral edema.

Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits (Option A) may also be useful in evaluating the patient, but it is not the most appropriate next step. Lumbar puncture with opening pressure (Option B) is not necessary at this time, as the patient does not have any symptoms or signs of elevated intracranial pressure. Admitting the patient and consulting neuro-ophthalmology (Option D) may be necessary depending on the results of the imaging studies, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this time.

Explanation: The patient's history of recurrent gingivitis and persistent lymphadenopathy, along with the presence of bilateral hypopyons, suggests a possible diagnosis of ocular sarcoidosis. Lymph node biopsy would be the next step to confirm the diagnosis. Biopsy of the iris nodule (option A) may also be considered, but lymph node biopsy is more likely to provide a definitive diagnosis. Prescribing intravitreal vancomycin and ceftrazidime (option C) may be appropriate if there is a concern for bacterial endophthalmitis, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. Obtaining bacterial and fungal blood cultures (option D) may also be considered, but it is not as relevant as the other options.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of worsening exertional dyspnea, recurrent admissions for decompensated heart failure, and severe mitral stenosis suggests that the mechanical prosthesis is failing. The transesophageal echocardiogram shows complete immobilization of one leaflet and impaired excursion of the other, indicating that the prosthesis is not functioning properly. The patient's history of mitral valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting, as well as the absence of any obvious overlying mass, suggests that the issue is not thrombosis or infection, but rather mechanical failure of the prosthesis. Therefore, the best next step would be to obtain consultation for urgent surgical valve replacement.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient had a history of substernal total thyroidectomy for a T3N0M0 right-sided undifferentiated insular carcinoma, which is a type of thyroid cancer that can metastasize to the lungs. The patient's symptoms of dysphagia, dysphonia, and tracheal deviation were resolved after the surgery, but ultrasonography revealed a hypoechoic mass in the right central compartment and a suspicious lymph node in the right carotid sheath. Fine-needle aspiration confirmed recurrence of a malignant neoplasm in the central compartment. The patient underwent a right central (level VI) lymph node dissection, and during the procedure, a separate pale tan mass 2 cm in diameter was visualized at the level of the thoracic inlet. The mass demonstrated respiratory expansion and retraction. The histopathologic analysis revealed a cystic mass composed primarily of mucosal cells and sparse fibroconnective tissue. Based on the patient's history and the findings, the most likely diagnosis is a laryngocele, which is a rare benign lesion that originates from the laryngeal mucosa. It is typically located in the supraglottic region and can cause symptoms such as dysphagia, odynophagia, and respiratory distress. The patient's symptoms and the location of the mass near the thoracic inlet are consistent with a laryngocele. The other options, apical lung bulla/bleb, tracheocele, and Zenker diverticulum, are less likely given the patient's history and the findings. Therefore, the correct answer is C, Laryngocele.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of hoarseness, snoring, and retractions during sleep, along with the physical examination findings of mild inspiratory stridor and light-brown macules on the skin, are consistent with a diagnosis of granular cell tumor. The submucosal lesion of the left aryepiglottic fold extending inferiorly to the level of the arytenoid, and displacing the epiglottis medially, as seen on direct laryngoscopy, also supports this diagnosis. The histopathologic features of bundles of spindle cells with angulated nuclei in a stroma of variable coarse collagen and loose myxoid matrix, as seen in the biopsy specimen, are also consistent with a diagnosis of granular cell tumor. Therefore, option B (Granular cell tumor) is the correct answer.

The fact that the patient had a history of submandibular gland swelling and pain, and that the cystic lesion developed after "burning her mouth" with high-temperature food, suggests that the cyst may have originated from a blocked salivary duct. The patient's history of recurrent floor of mouth swelling and the presence of inflammation, cystic space, and compressed granulation tissues in the pathologic analysis also support this diagnosis. The other options, submandibular duct sialocele, lymphangioma, and abscess, do not fit the patient's symptoms and clinical findings as well.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive sore throat, dysphagia, fever, and dyspnea, along with the physical examination findings of erythema, edema, and patchy necrosis of the epiglottitis, are consistent with pseudomembranous epiglottitis. This condition is a severe, life-threatening infection that can cause airway obstruction and is often caused by bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae or Haemophilus influenzae. The patient's history of ulcerative colitis and recent treatment with oral amoxicillin-clavulanic acid also support this diagnosis, as pseudomembranous epiglottitis is a known complication of ulcerative colitis. Candidosis (option A) is a possibility, but the patient's symptoms and examination findings do not suggest this diagnosis as strongly as pseudomembranous epiglottitis. Diphtheric laryngitis (option B) is unlikely, as the patient does not have a history of exposure to diphtheria and the physical examination findings do not support this diagnosis. Necrotic epiglottitis (option D) is a possibility, but the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a more severe and acute infection, which is consistent with pseudomembranous epiglottitis.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of decreased vision and cognitive decline, along with the physical examination findings of rubeosis iridis, neovascularization of the optic disc, retinal vasculitis, and venous sheathing, suggest a diagnosis of ocular inflammation. The patient's history of renal cell carcinoma and recent nephrectomy suggest a possible association with autoimmune disease. Therefore, it would be appropriate to check for various autoantibodies, including antinuclear antibodies, anticardiolipin antibodies, anti–double-stranded DNA antibodies, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies. Additionally, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels should be checked, as elevated ACE levels can be seen in autoimmune diseases. These tests can help support a diagnosis of autoimmune-related ocular inflammation and guide further management.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and clinical findings, including foggy vision, headaches, and an orange, round, circumscribed mass with overlying tractional retinal detachment, suggest a possible diagnosis of a retinal pigment epithelial tumor. The patient's history of a pheochromocytoma and bilateral adrenal gland resection also suggest a possible genetic predisposition to developing such a tumor. Therefore, the next step would be to refer the patient for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate the possibility of a retinal pigment epithelial tumor and any potential associated intracranial extension. MRI can provide valuable information on the size, location, and extent of the tumor, as well as any potential involvement of surrounding tissues. This information would be essential in determining the appropriate course of treatment for the patient.

Therefore, option C, "Refer for magnetic resonance imaging," is the correct answer.

Option A, "Conduct complete blood cell count," may be appropriate in some cases, but it is not directly related to the patient's symptoms or clinical findings, and it would not provide the same level of information as an MRI.

Option B, "Conduct genetic testing," may also be appropriate in some cases, but it would not provide the same level of information as an MRI, and it would not be the next step in the patient's evaluation.

Option D, "Perform retinal biopsy," is not appropriate at this time, as it would be invasive and would not provide the same level of information as an MRI.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of fever, weakness, and dyspnea, along with the bilateral opacities on chest radiograph and CT scan, are consistent with Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PJP). The patient's history of allogeneic stem cell transplant and immunosuppression with prednisone and tacrolimus increases her risk for PJP. The fact that the patient's symptoms developed 8 months after transplant and the radiographic findings of bilateral ground glass opacities with interlobular septal thickening are also consistent with PJP. Additionally, the patient's recent exposure to her son's cough and the lack of recent travel suggest that the infection is likely to be PJP. Therefore, adding trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole and corticosteroids would be the appropriate next step in management.

Answer: C. Leukemia cutis.
Explanation: Leukemia cutis is a rare condition where leukemic cells infiltrate the skin, causing various skin lesions. The patient's history of AML, recurrent fever, and negative work-up for infection suggest that the skin lesions could be related to leukemia cutis. The histopathological findings of large mononuclear cells with high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio and positive immunohistochemistry staining for CD4 cells and myeloperoxidase support this diagnosis. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) skin infection (option A) is less likely given the patient's negative blood cultures and lack of skin ulceration or pigmentation. Candida tropicalis (option B) is also unlikely since the patient did not have a history of Candida infection and there was no evidence of fungal infection on laboratory work-up. Disseminated coccidioidomycosis (option D) is unlikely given the patient's negative serology and lack of respiratory symptoms.

The patient's family history, with a similar condition in her father and sister, suggests that there may be a genetic component to the condition. The absence of other skin or joint problems, and the patient's history of asthma, suggest that the condition is not likely to be caused by a systemic disease. The patient's symptoms, such as pruritus and thickening of the toenails, are consistent with onychodystrophy. Given the persistent nature of the condition, it would be appropriate to perform a diagnostic test, such as a nail biopsy or fungal culture, to clarify the diagnosis and guide treatment.

Glomus tumors are benign tumors that originate from the glomus cells of the nail bed and are known to cause pain and discomfort, especially in response to cold temperatures. The presence of a nail matrix lesion and the tenderness on palpation of the nail unit also support this diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's history of a sunburn several weeks prior to the initial eruption, the rapid multiplication of dark papules, and the presence of hyperpigmented macules after scratching suggest a diagnosis of dermosis papulosa nigra (DPN). DPN is a rare benign condition characterized by the proliferation of pigmented epithelioid melanocytic nests, primarily located at the tips of rete ridges, with moderate cytologic atypia and prominent pigment incontinence in the superficial papillary dermis. The lack of mitotic figures and the presence of low pagetoid migration of melanocytes with a lack of melanocytic confluence at the dermal-epidermal junction, as shown by the Melan-A immunostain, also support this diagnosis.

The other options do not fit the patient's clinical presentation and histopathologic findings. Superficial spreading melanoma (option A) typically presents with a larger diameter and irregular shape, and would show more significant cytologic atypia and mitotic activity. Eruptive disseminated Spitz nevi (option B) typically appear as small, round, brown papules, and do not have the same degree of cytologic atypia or pigment incontinence as seen in DPN. Metastatic melanoma (option D) would be unlikely given the patient's age and lack of personal or family history of melanoma.

Explanation: The clinical presentation of a large, verrucous plaque on the calf, with a history of gradual growth, recurrent infections, oozing, and bleeding, is consistent with verruca vulgaris. The histopathological features shown in Figures B and C, including epidermal verrucous hyperplasia, acanthosis, papillomatosis, and hyperkeratosis overlying dilated vessels in the dermis, also support this diagnosis. The negative D2-40 stain (Figure D) helps to rule out the possibility of a melanocytic lesion. While angiokeratoma circumscriptum may also present with a verrucous appearance, it typically lacks the degree of hyperkeratosis and papillomatosis seen in this case. Verrucous hemangioma is a rare vascular tumor that may have a similar appearance, but it typically has a more rapid growth rate and a more prominent vascular component, which is not seen in this case. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is verruca vulgaris.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of back pain, limited physical activity, and mild tenderness to palpation of the lumbar spine, along with the radiographic findings of a paravertebral mass, compression fracture, and bony erosion, are consistent with discitis. Discitis is an infection of the intervertebral disc that can cause back pain, fever, and limited mobility. The patient's history of asthma and constipation may also suggest a possible immune compromise, increasing the risk of infection. The presence of paravertebral abscesses and mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy on the CT scan also support the diagnosis of discitis.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive dizziness, lightheadedness, and shortness of breath, along with the physical examination findings of a positive Kussmaul sign and pulsus paradoxus, suggest compression of the superior vena cava and right ventricle. The echocardiography results showing normal cardiac chambers and valves, along with the chest radiograph and computed tomographic imaging findings of a large anterior mediastinal mass compressing the right cardiac structures, support the diagnosis of a mediastinal tumor. The patient's age and lack of other symptoms make thymoma (option A) less likely. Thymolipoma (option B) is a rare benign tumor that typically occurs in the thymus and consists of a mixture of fat and thymic tissue. It is often asymptomatic, but can cause symptoms due to compression of surrounding structures, as in this case. Mediastinal lipomatosis (option C) is a rare condition characterized by excessive fat accumulation in the mediastinum, but it typically does not cause symptoms or compress surrounding structures. Myelolipoma (option D) is a rare benign tumor that originates from the bone marrow and consists of a mixture of fat and hematopoietic cells. It can cause symptoms due to compression of surrounding structures, but it is not typically found in the mediastinum. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is thymolipoma.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, distension, vomiting, and right lower quadrant tenderness, which developed 20 hours after the embolization procedure, suggest a possible small bowel obstruction or ileus. The fact that the patient had a history of rectal bleeding and underwent embolization of a right colic artery branch suggests that the ileus may be caused by retained intraluminal old blood. This is supported by the presence of pooling contrast in the cecum noted on the computed tomographic angiogram (Figure 1A). Prolonged ileus secondary to retained intraluminal old blood is a recognized complication of lower gastrointestinal bleeding and embolization. Therefore, option C is the most likely diagnosis.

Option A, right colon ischemia, is unlikely since the patient did not have any symptoms or signs of ischemia before the embolization procedure, and the computed tomographic scan of the abdomen and pelvis obtained 20 hours after the procedure was unremarkable.

Option B, endoscopic perforation, is unlikely since the patient did not have any symptoms or signs of perforation before the embolization procedure, and the endoscopic treatment of the right colon arteriovenous malformation was unsuccessful.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and findings are consistent with uveitis, which is an inflammatory condition that affects the uvea, the middle layer of the eye. The presence of vitreous haze, mild optic disc edema, and elevated white chorioretinal lesions with surrounding intraretinal and subretinal hemorrhage in the right eye are all consistent with uveitis. The fact that the patient had recently undergone ureterorenoscopies and had a ureteral stent placed suggests that the uveitis may be related to a systemic inflammatory response. Initiating a uveitis workup and beginning topical glucocorticoid therapy would be the appropriate next step in managing this patient's condition. Intravitreal injection with vancomycin and ceftazidime (option A) may be considered if the uveitis is caused by an infectious agent, but it is not the first step in management. Obtaining a urinalysis (option C) may be useful in evaluating the patient's overall health and potential underlying causes of the uveitis, but it is not the most appropriate next step. Performing a diagnostic pars plana vitrectomy (option D) is a more invasive procedure that may be considered if the uveitis is severe or refractory to other treatments, but it is not the first step in management.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's history of a high hyperopic refractive error, mild corectopia, and iridocorneal touch nasally, along with the "hammered silver" appearance of the involved cornea, suggests the possibility of a congenital anomaly. The patient's mother, who has a similar refractive error and underwent prophylactic laser iridotomy, suggests a possible genetic component. Testing the aqueous fluid for Human herpesvirus 1 (HHV-1) would help rule out a viral cause of the pupillary displacement, as HHV-1 can cause uveitis and other ocular manifestations. While pilocarpine eyedrops may be used to treat elevated intraocular pressure, there is no indication for their use in this case. Obtaining specular microscopy or recommending genetic testing may be appropriate next steps, but testing for HHV-1 is the most pressing concern given the patient's symptoms and medical history.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of unilateral proptosis, redness, diplopia, and numbness, along with the physical examination findings of conjunctival injection, tortuous blood vessels, and limitation of extraocular muscles, are consistent with orbital inflammation. The absence of a mass, abscess, or arteriovenous fistula on imaging suggests that the inflammation is likely due to an inflammatory or autoimmune disorder rather than an infection. Systemic corticosteroids would be appropriate to treat this condition and reduce the inflammation. Orbital biopsy may be considered in some cases, but given the patient's relatively mild symptoms and normal imaging results, it may not be necessary at this time. Starting systemic antibiotics without a clear diagnosis of an infection could be unnecessary and potentially harmful. Catheter cerebral angiography is not indicated in this case, as there is no suspicion of a vascular malformation or other vascular abnormality.

Answer: D
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a traumatic cataract and heterochromia iridis. The presence of a shallow anterior chamber and pigment deposition on the anterior lens capsule are consistent with a traumatic cataract. The heterochromia iridis is likely due to a previous trauma to the eye. The patient's symptoms of tearing, photophobia, and burning suggest that there may be an underlying irritation or inflammation in the eye.

Given these findings, the next step would be to perform a surgical intervention to remove the cataract and alleviate the patient's symptoms. Phacoemulsification with intraocular lens placement is the most appropriate procedure for this patient, as it allows for the removal of the cataract and the restoration of vision in the affected eye.

Observation (Option A) would not be appropriate, as the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest the need for urgent intervention. Computed tomography scan of the orbits without contrast (Option B) and magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits without contrast (Option C) are not necessary at this point, as the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a traumatic cataract and there is no evidence to suggest the presence of a retrobulbar foreign body or other intraocular pathology.

Answer: C 
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of sudden onset of seizures, hypoxemia, hypotension, and acute pulmonary edema, along with the findings of new dilation of the left ventricle, functional mitral regurgitation, and akinesis, are consistent with noncardiogenic pulmonary edema. The patient's history of end-stage lung disease and recent lung transplantation without cardiopulmonary bypass suggest that the underlying cause of the pulmonary edema is likely related to lung dysfunction rather than myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolism. Additionally, the patient's negative serum levels of troponin and creatine phosphokinase and the absence of atherosclerosis on recent coronary angiography support this diagnosis. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a possible diagnosis, but it is less likely given the patient's history and clinical presentation.

Answer: C. Malignant melanoma.
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of facial asymmetry and new-onset left-sided facial weakness, pain, and otalgia, along with the physical examination findings of incomplete left eye closure and no palpable parotid mass, suggest a diagnosis of malignant melanoma. The patient's age and the presence of subcutaneous nodules infiltrating the superficial parotid gland, as shown on magnetic resonance imaging, also support this diagnosis. The histopathologic findings of a subcutaneous mass with stellate extension into and around the parotid gland, composed of bland fusiform tumor cells in a storiform pattern, are consistent with malignant melanoma. Additionally, the immunohistochemical staining results, showing diffuse positivity for CD34 and positivity for bcl-2, are also consistent with this diagnosis. The fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) results, showing a translocation t(17;22)(q21;q13) and corresponding COL1A1/PDGFB fusion protein, further support the diagnosis of malignant melanoma.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of bilateral conductive hearing loss, normal otoscopic findings, and lack of improvement with tympanostomy tubes suggest that the cause of the hearing loss is not due to otosclerosis (A), tympanosclerosis (C), or malleoincudal subluxation (D). The patient's history of delayed speech development and normal MRI results also argue against a central auditory processing disorder. The most likely diagnosis is bilateral malleus fixation (B), which is a rare cause of conductive hearing loss in children. This diagnosis is supported by the patient's persistent CHL despite normal otoscopy results and the lack of any other identifiable causes. The patient's decision to continue with hearing aids and consider surgical intervention in the future is appropriate given the uncertainty of the etiology of the hearing loss.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of intermittent dysphagia to solid foods, dry cough, foreign-body sensation in the throat, and dyspnea on effort, along with the physical examination findings of mild bilateral hyperemia of the tonsillar area and posterior pharyngeal wall, and the presence of a highly vascularized supraglottic lesion on narrowband imaging, are consistent with a diagnosis of supraglottic paraganglioma. This type of neoplasm is known to arise from the paraganglia, which are clusters of cells located near the sympathetic trunk, and are characterized by their highly vascularized nature. The patient's history of hypertension and chronic rhinosinusitis may also be relevant to the patient's overall health and potential treatment plan, but they do not directly suggest a specific diagnosis.

The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and examination findings as well. Supraglottic hemangioma (option A) is a benign vascular tumor that can occur in the supraglottic region, but it is typically not as highly vascularized as the lesion described in the case, and may not cause the same level of symptoms. Rhabdomyoma of the epiglottis (option C) is a rare type of cancer that can occur in the epiglottis, but it typically presents with more severe symptoms and signs of airway obstruction, and may not have the same highly vascularized appearance on narrowband imaging. Laryngeal squamous papilloma (option D) is a type of benign tumor that can occur in the larynx, but it typically presents with different symptoms, such as hoarseness or vocal cord paralysis, and may not have the same level of vascularity as the lesion described in the case.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of joint, back, and abdominal pain, constipation, fatigue, and depression, along with an elevated serum ionized calcium level and a slightly elevated 24-hour urinary calcium level, are consistent with hyperparathyroidism. The technetium Tc-99m sestamibi scan showed a small focus of possible increased tracer uptake near the mid-pole of the left thyroid lobe, suggesting a parathyroid adenoma. The histopathological examination of the excised tissue showed a thinly encapsulated parathyroid tissue with approximately 30% displaying myxoid stromal change and focal presence of interspersed adipocytes, which is consistent with parathyroid lipohyperplasia. Therefore, the correct diagnosis is B, parathyroid lipohyperplasia.

Answer: C
Explanation:
The patient's history of waxing and waning pruritic papules involving different areas of his body over a period of 2 years, with each lesion occurring at different time points, suggests a diagnosis of lymphomatoid papulosis. This is supported by the pathologic findings of V-shaped perifascicular infiltrative large lymphocytes with abundant amphophilic cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli, which are consistent with the characteristic histopathologic features of lymphomatoid papulosis. The patient's negative TCR gene rearrangement testing also supports this diagnosis, as lymphomatoid papulosis is typically negative for TCR gene rearrangement. Additionally, the patient's lack of constitutional symptoms and absence of extracutaneous involvement on systemic imaging are consistent with lymphomatoid papulosis, which tends to be a localized cutaneous process.

The other options do not fit the patient's clinical presentation and pathologic findings as well. Adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (option A) is a malignancy that affects the T cells and typically presents with skin lesions, lymphadenopathy, and constitutional symptoms, which are not prominent in this patient's history. Primary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (option B) is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that presents with rapidly growing, painful skin lesions, often with a characteristic "fishbone" pattern on histopathology, which is not seen in this patient's biopsy findings. Transformed mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome (option D) are types of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that typically present with erythematous, scaly, or crusted plaques and nodules, and are often associated with significant lymphadenopathy and constitutional symptoms, which are not prominent in this patient's history.

Answer: D
Explanation:
The patient's laboratory results show a TSH level of 4.50 mIU/L, which is slightly elevated. This, combined with the patient's symptoms of hair thinning, itchy scalp, and cold sensitivity, suggests that the patient may have subclinical hypothyroidism. However, the patient does not have any other symptoms that are typically associated with hypothyroidism, such as fatigue, depression, memory problems, dry skin, or constipation. Therefore, it would be appropriate to repeat the TSH level in 1 to 3 months to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of the hypothyroidism.

Option A is incorrect because the patient's TSH level is not low enough to indicate overt hypothyroidism. Option B is incorrect because the patient's TSH level is not low enough to indicate subclinical hyperthyroidism. Option C is incorrect because the patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest that she may have subclinical hypothyroidism, and a repeat TSH level is necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of nystagmus, lower extremity hyperalgesia, and memory impairment suggest a possible diagnosis of Wernicke's encephalopathy, a condition caused by thiamine deficiency. Thiamine is essential for the proper functioning of the thalamus, which is responsible for relaying sensory information to the cortex. The patient's history of severe Crohn disease and recent surgery increase the likelihood of thiamine deficiency, as malabsorption and gut inflammation can impair thiamine absorption. The presence of bilateral medial thalamic hyperintensity on MRI supports this diagnosis. Therefore, the appropriate next step would be to start parenteral thiamine supplementation (option C). Intravenous acyclovir (option A) would not be effective in treating Wernicke's encephalopathy, as it is used to treat herpes simplex virus infections. Intravenous thrombolysis (option B) would not be appropriate, as there is no indication of a thrombotic event. Systemic corticosteroids (option D) may be considered in the future if the patient develops signs of inflammation or edema, but they would not address the underlying thiamine deficiency.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as fatigue, exertional dyspnea, arthralgias, hand swelling, tender ulcerations, hair loss, and weight loss, are consistent with a diagnosis of clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis (CADM). CADM is a rare subtype of dermatomyositis that lacks the characteristic muscle weakness and elevated creatine kinase levels seen in classic dermatomyositis. The patient's skin findings, including symmetric swelling of metacarpophalangeal joints and interphalangeal joints, ulcers distal to fingers, dyspigmented and atrophic skin, and lichenoid papules, are also consistent with CADM. Additionally, the patient's laboratory results, including hyperferritinemia and T lymphocytopenia, are consistent with CADM. The patient's negative results for HIV, anti-Scl-70 antibodies, anti-β2-glycoprotein 1 antibodies, lupus anticoagulant, cryoglobulins, and anti-Mi-2 antibodies, and normal prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and tissue thromboplastin, also support this diagnosis. Immunoglobulin G4-related disease and systemic lupus erythematosus can also present with similar symptoms, but the patient's laboratory results and skin findings are not consistent with these diagnoses. Sarcoidosis and/or lymphoma syndrome are less likely given the patient's negative results for sarcoidosis markers and the absence of lymphadenopathy or other signs of lymphoma.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results, along with the biopsy findings, suggest a diagnosis of crystal-storing histiocytosis (CSH). CSH is a rare condition characterized by the accumulation of crystalline structures within histiocytes, leading to a characteristic histopathological appearance. The patient's history of splenic marginal zone lymphoma and IgM paraproteinemia increases the likelihood of this diagnosis, as CSH is often associated with hematological malignancies. The presence of an interstitial infiltrate of deeply eosinophilic cells in the entire dermis and adjacent subcutis, as well as the positive staining for IgM on the crystals, supports the diagnosis of CSH. Wells syndrome, cutaneous amyloidosis, and erysipelas are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's clinical presentation and laboratory results.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's presentation of recurrent coma, refractory status epilepticus, and hyperammonemia suggests a metabolic disorder. Urea cycle disorder is a likely diagnosis, as it can cause hyperammonemia, seizures, and altered mental status. The patient's history of a previous episode of coma with no identifiable precipitant and an elevated ammonia level suggests a possible underlying metabolic disorder. The patient's workup, including liver and kidney function tests, did not reveal any obvious causes of hyperammonemia. The patient's myoclonus and refractory status epilepticus also support the diagnosis of urea cycle disorder. Additionally, the patient's lack of response to treatment with lactulose, which is commonly used to treat hyperammonemia, suggests that the patient may have a urea cycle disorder.

It's important to note that Reye syndrome (option A) is a possibility, but it's less likely given the patient's age and lack of evidence of viral infection. Fatty acid oxidation disorder (option C) and organic acidemia (option D) are also possible, but the patient's presentation and laboratory results are more consistent with urea cycle disorder.

Answer: A 
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as fever, sore throat, and tonsillar hypertrophy with erythema and exudates, are consistent with streptococcal pharyngitis. The positive rapid antigen detection test for group A Streptococcus and the growth of the bacteria in a throat culture further support this diagnosis. The presence of periorbital edema, ecchymosis, and conjunctival hemorrhage may be due to the spread of the bacterial infection to the orbital tissues, which is a known complication of streptococcal pharyngitis. The patient's recent history of amoxicillin use for acute otitis media may have contributed to the severity of the infection. The other options, Epstein-Barr virus infection, neuroblastoma, and viral hepatitis, do not explain the patient's symptoms and laboratory results as well as streptococcal pharyngitis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's history of a motorcycle crash and brief loss of consciousness, along with the presence of a large air-fluid level on the chest X-ray and the absence of any other gastrointestinal symptoms, suggests that the patient may have sustained a blunt traumatic rupture of the diaphragm. This is a rare injury that can occur when the diaphragm is subjected to a significant increase in intrathoracic pressure, such as during a motor vehicle accident. The patient's age and lack of other medical history also make this diagnosis more likely. A type IV hiatal hernia (A) is less likely given the patient's age and lack of symptoms, and would not explain the air-fluid level. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (B) is also less likely given the patient's age and lack of other symptoms. Diaphragm eventration (D) is a possibility, but would not explain the air-fluid level.

The absence of any other systemic symptoms or body involvement suggests that this is a localized infection. Oral aciclovir (option C) is an antiviral medication that is effective in treating viral conjunctivitis, and would be the appropriate next step in management. Observation (option A) may be appropriate for mild cases, but given the extent of the lesions and the patient's discomfort, treatment with antivirals is warranted.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of worsening headache, nausea, blurred vision, and fever, along with the physical examination findings of otitis media and mastoiditis, suggest that the patient has developed a complication of mastoiditis with possible intracranial extension. The patient's history of recent cesarean delivery and transverse sinus thrombosis also increases the likelihood of this diagnosis. Oral antibiotics should be prescribed to treat the mastoiditis, and close monitoring in an outpatient clinical setting is appropriate to ensure that the patient's condition does not deteriorate further. Continuing anticoagulation is also appropriate to prevent further thrombosis. Performing an immediate lumbar puncture (option C) may be necessary if the patient's symptoms worsen or if there is evidence of increased intracranial pressure, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this time. Urgent radical mastoidectomy (option D) is not necessary at this time and may not be necessary at all, depending on the outcome of further evaluation and management.

The apraclonidine test is a specific test for Horner syndrome, and a positive result would confirm the diagnosis. Therefore, option C is the most appropriate next step in the patient's management.

Option A, performing a lumbar puncture, may be necessary later on in the patient's management to rule out other causes of Horner syndrome, such as a spinal cord tumor or abscess, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this point.

Option B, ordering magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography of the brain and cervical spine, may also be necessary later on in the patient's management to evaluate for other causes of Horner syndrome, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this point.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of progressive shortness of breath, elevated troponin-T levels, and restricted diastolic filling with a low left ventricular ejection fraction on echocardiography, along with the sawtooth pattern of hyperenhancement in the left ventricular epicardium on CMR, suggests a diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis. The absence of coronary artery disease and the presence of myocardial edema on T2-weighted short tau inversion recovery imaging also support this diagnosis.

Immunofixation and light chain determination (option D) would be the appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis of cardiac amyloidosis. This test can help identify the type of amyloidosis, which can guide further management and prognosis.

Option A, close follow-up and medical treatment, may be appropriate for patients with mild or asymptomatic cardiac amyloidosis, but in this case, the patient's symptoms and test results suggest a more advanced stage of the disease, requiring further diagnostic testing.

Option B, positron emission tomographic/CT imaging, may be used to assess the prognosis and monitor the response to treatment in some cases of cardiac amyloidosis, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's management.

Answer: D
Explanation:
The given clinical case describes a patient with a destructive hard palate mass that has caused malocclusion and ipsilateral upper lip numbness, and has been diagnosed with a heterogeneously ossified lesion filling the left maxillary sinus, with local destruction of hard palate and alveolar bone. The patient's history of recent pericoronitis and unhelpful courses of antibiotics, along with the absence of difficulty speaking, breathing, or swallowing, and the presence of focal areas of osteoid matrix in the tumor, suggest that the diagnosis is most likely a malignant ossifying fibromyxoid tumor (MOFT).

MOFT is a rare malignant tumor that arises from the mesenchyme of the head and neck region, and typically affects the paranasal sinuses and nasal cavity. It is characterized by a lobular architecture and an incomplete peripheral ossified rim, which are both present in the biopsy specimen of the patient's tumor. The focal areas of osteoid matrix and the presence of atypical cells with increased mitotic activity in a myxoid stroma also support this diagnosis.

Chondroblastic osteosarcoma (option A) is a malignant tumor that arises from the cartilage-forming cells of the bone, and typically affects the long bones of the extremities. It is unlikely to occur in the maxillary sinus and would not explain the patient's symptoms or imaging findings.

Chondrosarcoma (option B) is a malignant tumor that arises from the cartilage cells of the bone, and can occur in the head and neck region. However, it typically affects the nasal septum and would not explain the patient's symptoms or imaging findings.

Malignant mixed tumor of salivary gland (option C) is a rare malignant tumor that arises from the salivary glands, and typically affects the parotid gland. It is unlikely to occur in the maxillary sinus and would not explain the patient's symptoms or imaging findings

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of positional shortness of breath and sensation of airway obstruction, along with the physical examination findings of a large, irregular pedunculated mass on the left anterior false vocal fold, are consistent with a diagnosis of a benign tumor of the larynx. The patient's age and the pathological description of the mass, which shows a papillary-like architecture, expansion of the submucosa by benign mature adipose tissue, and variable amount of fibrous tissue, also support this diagnosis. Squamous papilloma is a benign tumor that arises from the squamous epithelium of the larynx and is the most common type of benign laryngeal tumor. It is typically slow-growing and may cause symptoms similar to those described by the patient.

The double-lined appearance of the sinus walls and the bony defects in the sphenoid sinus walls next to the cavernous sinus are consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the hyperintense line peripheral layer on T2-weighted images and the irregularly thick hypointense line consistent with sclerotic bone visible on CT support this diagnosis. The absence of contrast enhancement of the remainder of the sinus on VIBE sequences and the lack of a cleavage plane between the hyperenhancing area in the sphenoid sinus and the bright signal of the internal carotid artery in the cavernous sinus also support this diagnosis. Fungus ball, cerebrospinal fluid leak with sinusitis, and hypervascular metastasis from thyroid cancer are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.

The patient's medical history of atopic dermatitis and elevated IgE levels support this diagnosis. The patient's age and lack of radiation or immunosuppressive medication use also align with the demographics of patients typically diagnosed with angiolymphoid hyperplasia. The patient's facial nerve function being normal also supports this diagnosis, as angiolymphoid hyperplasia typically does not affect facial nerve function. The patient's postgadolinium MRI showing infiltration into the cartilaginous tissue of the external auditory canal and ipsilateral cervical adenopathy, as well as the histopathologic images showing prominent follicular hyperplasia, a diffuse infiltrate of eosinophils, and an increase in small blood vessels within the germinal centers, are also consistent with angiolymphoid hyperplasia. Finally, the patient's excisional biopsy of the postauricular node showing densely fibrotic stroma with perivascular sclerosis is also consistent with angiolymphoid hyperplasia.

The fact that the lesion extended posterolaterally to the aryepiglottic fold and obscured visualization of the glottis, and that the right laryngeal ventricle was effaced, also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's age and lack of significant medical or surgical history make laryngeal carcinoma less likely. A thyroid cartilage chondroma would not explain the patient's symptoms or physical examination findings, and laryngocele is not typically associated with a submucosal mass. The pathologic findings of benign tissue also support the diagnosis of a laryngeal saccular cyst.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, and colonic wall thickening on imaging are consistent with colitis. The patient's history of receiving idelalisib, a medication that can cause colitis as a side effect, supports this diagnosis. The patient's negative stool cultures and negative C. difficile toxin assay suggest that this is not an infectious colitis, such as that caused by C. difficile. The patient's history of follicular lymphoma and treatment with idelalisib also increase the likelihood of drug-induced colitis. The absence of organomegaly and the presence of diffuse tenderness to deep palpation on physical examination also support this diagnosis. Therefore, option C, idelalisib-induced colitis, is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: D
Explanation: The patient's presentation of painless blisters on the hands, with a history of heavy alcohol consumption and smoking, suggests a diagnosis of hand-foot-mouth disease (HFMD), which is caused by coxsackievirus. The presence of hemorrhagic vesicles, erosions with hemorrhagic crusting, and milia on the dorsal surfaces of the hands, as well as the sparing of the palms, is consistent with HFMD. The patient's history of recent smoking cessation and reduced alcohol intake may also be relevant to the patient's overall health and potential treatment plan, but they are not directly related to the likely diagnosis of HFMD. Therefore, the appropriate next step would be to swab the lesions and send the sample for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing for coxsackievirus, as this is the most specific and sensitive diagnostic test for HFMD.

Answer: D. The patient has antiglomerular basement membrane disease (Goodpasture syndrome).
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of cough with blood-streaked sputum, weight loss, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, along with the laboratory results of hematuria and proteinuria, are consistent with Goodpasture syndrome, a rare autoimmune disease that affects the lungs and kidneys. The presence of diffuse crackles on lung examination and bilateral opacities on chest x-ray are also consistent with pulmonary involvement. The patient's history of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis increases the likelihood of Goodpasture syndrome. The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and laboratory results. Option A is unlikely as the patient does not have fever, chest pain, or dyspnea on exertion, which are common symptoms of pneumonia. Option B is also unlikely as the patient does not have the characteristic skin rash or arthritis seen in systemic lupus erythematosus. Option C is not consistent with the patient's symptoms or laboratory results, as microscopic polyangiitis typically affects the kidneys and lungs, but the patient does not have kidney involvement.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes and insulin-like growth factor 1 deficiency, along with the physical examination findings of multiple small, monomorphic, and somewhat octagonal groupings of folliculocentric, erythematous, scaly, and hyperkeratotic papules at different stages of development, are consistent with a diagnosis of follicular mucinosis. The presence of mild pruritus and the absence of systemic symptoms such as fevers, chills, night sweats, or rapid unexpected weight loss also support this diagnosis. Follicular mucinosis is a rare condition characterized by the accumulation of mucin in the follicular epithelium, leading to the formation of scaly papules and plaques. It is often associated with diabetes mellitus, as in this case. In contrast, follicular pityriasis rubra pilaris is a condition characterized by reddish-brown, scaly papules on the extensor surfaces of the limbs, and is not associated with diabetes mellitus. Follicular psoriasis is a condition characterized by red, scaly plaques on the scalp, face, and body, and is not typically associated with diabetes mellitus. Follicular lymphomatoid papulosis is a rare condition characterized by the development of papules and nodules on the skin, which can be associated with systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, and weight loss, and is not consistent with the patient's history or physical examination findings. Therefore, option C, follicular mucinosis, is the most appropriate diagnosis for this patient.

Answer: C 
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including painful nodules on the lower extremities, neck, and jawline, are consistent with Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome. This rare genetic disorder is characterized by the development of multiple fibrofolliculomas, trichodiscomas, and acrochordons. The patient's medical history, including seasonal allergies, and lack of prescription medications, also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the physical examination findings, such as scattered skin-colored papules on the neck and thigh, and a solitary skin-colored nodule on the jawline, are consistent with Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome. Neurofibromatosis type I, Reed syndrome, and tuberous sclerosis are all distinct conditions with different clinical features and are therefore less likely diagnoses.

Answer: C. Congenital syphilis.
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as widespread papulovesicular, crusted lesions on the arms, legs, face, scalp, and trunk, are consistent with congenital syphilis. The fact that the patient's mother was varicella nonimmune and had no active rashes, including in the perineal area, makes it less likely that the patient has neonatal varicella syndrome (option A). The patient's afebrile status and the absence of other symptoms, such as meningitis or sepsis, also support the diagnosis of congenital syphilis over disseminated herpes infection (option B). Langerhans cell histiocytosis (option D) is a rare condition that typically presents with skin lesions and lymphadenopathy, but it is not typically associated with a diffuse rash at birth. The patient's symptoms and history suggest that congenital syphilis is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, along with the finding of a lost gallstone in the left hemiabdomen on CT scan, are consistent with gallstone ileus. This occurs when a gallstone passes into the small intestine and causes an obstruction. The patient's history of laparoscopic cholecystectomy and the presence of a calcified mass with adjacent inflammatory changes in the left hemiabdomen also support this diagnosis. Intra-abdominal abscess (A) is unlikely given the patient's lack of fever and chills, and the absence of any signs of infection on CT scan. Gallstone granuloma (C) is a rare complication of gallstone disease and is characterized by the formation of a granuloma around a gallstone, which is not seen in this case. Eroded gallstone into the abdominal wall (D) is also unlikely given the patient's symptoms and the findings on CT scan.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's history of acute pancreatitis and the presence of a fluid collection encysted by a well-defined enhancing wall on the contrast-enhanced CT scan are consistent with a pancreatic pseudocyst. A pancreatic pseudocyst is a fluid-filled cavity that forms in the pancreas as a result of inflammation or necrosis. The patient's symptoms of a progressively growing abdominal lump, dull ache, and heavy feeling are also consistent with a pancreatic pseudocyst. The patient's history of prolonged alcohol abuse increases the likelihood of this diagnosis, as alcohol consumption is a common risk factor for pancreatitis and pancreatic pseudocysts. The other options, mesenteric cyst, gastric duplication cyst, and walled-off pancreatic necrosis, can also present with abdominal lumps, but they are less likely given the patient's history and the findings on the CT scan.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's complaints of a large, linear "floater" in his central vision, which is very disturbing to him, indicate that the fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant is causing a significant visual disturbance. The implant's location in the middle of the vitreous cavity and in the visual axis (Figure 1) suggests that it may be causing a mechanical obstruction or irritation to the retina, leading to the patient's symptoms.

Option C, using a neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser to release the implant, is the most appropriate next step. This laser can be used to create a small hole in the implant, allowing it to move away from the visual axis and potentially reducing the patient's symptoms. This approach is less invasive than option D, performing a pars plana vitrectomy, which would require a larger surgical procedure to remove or displace the implant.

Option A, continuing to observe and hope the implant settles down or moves away from the visual axis, may not be effective in this case, as the patient's symptoms have persisted for 2 weeks and the implant has not moved away from the visual axis.

Option B, injecting an intravitreous gas bubble, may not be effective in this case, as the gas bubble may not be able to displace the implant from its location in the vitreous cavity. Additionally, the gas bubble may cause other complications, such as retinal detachment or damage to the retinal tissue.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of persistent blurry vision, middilated and poorly reactive pupils, and lens dislocation into the anterior chamber with lenticulocorneal touch suggest a diagnosis of phacodonesis or dislocation of the crystalline lens. This condition can occur due to various causes such as trauma, inflammation, or systemic diseases that affect the eye. In this case, the patient's history of high myopia, astigmatism, and mild cataracts, as well as narrow angles, suggests that the dislocation may be related to the patient's previous laser peripheral iridotomy.

The appropriate management for phacodonesis includes surgical intervention, which involves lensectomy with anterior vitrectomy and intraocular lens placement. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.

Option A, pharmacologically redilating the pupils and positioning the patient supinely, may provide temporary relief of symptoms but does not address the underlying cause of the dislocation.

Option C, referring the patient for connective tissue disease workup, may be appropriate if the dislocation is suspected to be related to a systemic disease, but there is no indication of such a condition in this case.

Option D, observing and reevaluating the patient in 2 months, is not appropriate as the patient's symptoms are persistent and the dislocation is likely to cause further complications if left untreated.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as leukocoria, decreased vision, and relative afferent pupillary defect, suggest a possible intraocular tumor. An MRI of the brain and orbits would be the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of the tumor. Chemotherapy would likely be necessary to treat the tumor, hence option A is the correct answer. Option B, examining under anesthesia, may be necessary later on, but it is not the most urgent step.

Answer: C
Explanation: The correct answer is option C, Perform transcorneal biopsy of the lesion.

The patient's symptoms and clinical findings suggest a possible iris tumor. The lesion's location, size, and appearance, as well as the patient's history of gradually enlarging over several years, are consistent with this diagnosis. It is important to establish the diagnosis and determine the nature of the tumor to guide further management.

Option C, Perform transcorneal biopsy of the lesion, is the most appropriate next step. This procedure involves removing a small sample of tissue from the iris lesion for histopathological examination. It is a relatively safe and quick procedure that can provide valuable diagnostic information.

Option A, Observe at yearly intervals, may not be the best choice as it may allow the tumor to progress and potentially cause vision loss if it is a malignant tumor.

Option B, Obtain high-frequency ultrasound biomicroscopy, may provide additional information about the lesion's size, shape, and location, but it may not be able to establish a definitive diagnosis.

Option D, Completely excise the lesion with pathological analysis, may be considered if the diagnosis is established, but it may not be necessary at this point, and it carries a higher risk of complications compared to a biopsy.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient has a new rSR′ pattern with concave upward ST-segment elevations in leads V1 to V3, which suggests that there is a new myocardial infarction. The most likely cause of this new infarction is a occlusion of the left coronary artery, which could not be detected by the coronary angiogram because it is not visualized in the same plane as the right coronary artery. Therefore, performing an ECG using posterior leads (C) would be the next best step to confirm the diagnosis of a new myocardial infarction and identify the location of the occlusion.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and the results of the MRI and CT scans are consistent with a teratoma. The mass effect on the airway and the presence of calcifications within the mass also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the pathologic results showing a multinodular mass with multiple tissue types present, including solid and cystic components, are consistent with a teratoma. Lymphatic malformation (A) is unlikely given the lack of any mention of lymphatic involvement in the patient's symptoms or imaging results. Venous malformation (C) is also unlikely given the absence of any mention of venous involvement in the patient's symptoms or imaging results. Dermoid cyst (D) is unlikely given the presence of solid components and calcifications within the mass, which are not typical features of a dermoid cyst.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's history of a slowly growing mass in the left jaw, along with the imaging findings of a well-defined hypodense mass within the left masticator space, remodeling of the left mandibular ramus, and absence of overlying skin or mucosal changes, are consistent with a diagnosis of cystic ameloblastoma. The patient's age and the absence of other symptoms also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the pathologic assessment of a squamous lined cyst with parakeratosis is consistent with cystic ameloblastoma. Lymphangioma (A) is a benign tumor that typically affects the soft tissues of the neck and thorax, and is not typically associated with the jaw or mandible. Keratocystic odontogenic tumor (B) is a type of odontogenic tumor that typically affects the jaw, but is usually smaller and more circumscribed than the mass described in the case.

Answer: B. Metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
Explanation: The patient's history of stage IV clear cell renal cell carcinoma with metastasis to the ipsilateral adrenal gland, along with the MRI showing interval growth at the frontal bones in the region of previously diagnosed FD, suggests that the soft-tissue nodules are likely metastatic lesions from the patient's known renal cell carcinoma. The patient's lack of symptoms such as fever, vision changes, or neurologic symptoms, and the absence of a mass effect on the brain, also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the positive immunohistochemical stains for pancytokeratin, vimentin, CD10, and PAX-8, which are commonly expressed in renal cell carcinoma, further support this diagnosis. The absence of a contribution from the CA-IX stain, which is commonly positive in renal cell carcinoma, may be due to the presence of a variant of renal cell carcinoma that does not express CA-IX. Therefore, option B, Metastatic renal cell carcinoma, is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The correct answer is C, Eccrine syringofibroadenoma and squamous cell carcinoma. The given clinical case describes a patient with a 3- to 4-month history of a small cutaneous lesion on his left temple, which has been growing in size and draining. The patient's medical history includes emphysema but no previous skin cancers or surgery. On physical examination, the patient has a 2.5 × 2-cm, singular, umbilicated, ulcerated papular lesion of the left temple with overlying crusts and surrounding erythema and induration. Computed tomography with contrast of the soft tissue revealed an abnormal mass in the site of the left temporal scalp lesion, which appeared homogenous and was not particularly enhanced by contrast. There was no accompanying surrounding lymphadenopathy. A preoperative biopsy and low-power histological analysis revealed an epidermal proliferative process; vertically oriented anastomosing strands of basaloid epithelium were seen arising from multiple points along the epidermis. In this case, there was concurrent well-differentiated carcinoma. Ductal differentiation was observed on high power, and the mass had an intervening fibrovascular stroma. Based on these findings, the diagnosis is most likely Eccrine syringofibroadenoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Eccrine syringofibroadenoma is a rare benign adnexal tumor that arises from the eccrine sweat gland. It typically presents as a slowly growing, painless nodule or plaque on the scalp, face, or neck. The tumor has a characteristic histological appearance, with vertically oriented anastomosing strands of basaloid epithelium arising from multiple points along the epidermis, which is consistent with the findings in this case. Squamous cell carcinoma is a malignant epithelial tumor that can arise in association with Eccrine syringofibroadenoma, as seen in this case. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's history of a nonhealing submental ulcer, fixed to the underlying mandible, and poor dental health, along with the presence of caries and periodontal disease, suggest a diagnosis of nodular fasciitis. The infiltrative growth pattern and presence of epithelioid or spindle-shaped tumor cells with atypical vesicular nuclei and pale eosinophilic cytoplasm, along with areas of necrosis, are also consistent with nodular fasciitis. The strong positive staining for EMA, CD34, and pankeratin and loss of INI-1 immunostaining support this diagnosis. Squamous cell carcinoma would be a more likely diagnosis if the patient had a history of tobacco use and alcohol consumption, but this is not mentioned in the case. Histiocytoma and epithelioid sarcoma are less likely diagnoses given the patient's history and the histopathologic findings.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of chronic fatigue and weight loss, along with the physical examination findings of a low body mass index, normal vital signs, and darkening of the palmar creases and buccal mucosa, suggest the possibility of primary adrenal insufficiency. This is supported by the laboratory results, which show a low cortisol level and a high adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) level. A 250-μg corticotropin stimulation test would help to confirm the diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency by assessing the patient's response to exogenous ACTH.

The other options are not as appropriate for the patient's symptoms and laboratory results. Evaluating for congenital adrenal hyperplasia with serum 17-hydroxyprogesterone (Option A) would not be relevant for a patient with primary adrenal insufficiency. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate for a pituitary adenoma (Option C) may be necessary later in the evaluation, but it is not the most appropriate next step given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

Answer: C 
Explanation: The patient's history of recurrent photodistributed skin eruptions, along with the physical examination findings of acral edema and well-demarcated, tender petechial patches on the dorsal surface of the hands and feet, are consistent with urticarial vasculitis. The pathologic images show subtle thickening of vessel walls, extravasation of erythrocytes, and fibrin thrombus formation, which are also consistent with urticarial vasculitis. The absence of vesicles and the lack of a family history of similar symptoms further support this diagnosis. Hereditary angioedema (option A) is unlikely given the absence of a family history and the presence of petechial eruptions. Erythropoietic protoporphyria (option B) typically presents with painful photosensitivity and liver dysfunction, which are not features of this case. Acrodynia (option D) is a rare condition that typically presents with painful photosensitivity and a characteristic "sunburn" rash, which is not consistent with the patient's presentation.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as the marfanoid habitus, disproportion of limbs, and enlarged face, are consistent with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2b (MEN2b). MEN2b is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of the endocrine system and can cause a variety of symptoms, including those observed in the patient. The presence of multiple mucosal neuromas in the tongue, as shown in the biopsy results, is also a common feature of MEN2b. Additionally, the patient's age and lack of relevant family history are consistent with MEN2b, as it typically presents in the first decade of life and can be caused by de novo mutations.

The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and test results as well. Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome is a rare neurological disorder that can cause facial swelling and nodules, but it does not typically involve the tongue or have the same histopathological features as MEN2b. Crohn disease is a gastrointestinal disorder that can cause oral lesions, but it does not typically cause the marfanoid habitus or the specific histopathological features seen in MEN2b.

The presence of purple papules with central black and hemorrhagic crusting on the face, thighs, and anterior thighs, as well as the large polycyclic, atrophic hyperpigmented plaque with a slightly erythematous and scaly border on the left flank, are all characteristic of Bacillary angiomatosis. Additionally, the patient's history of end-stage liver disease secondary to alcoholic cirrhosis increases the likelihood of this diagnosis, as Bacillary angiomatosis is a rare complication of liver disease.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and imaging findings are consistent with a metastatic carcinoma. The patient has a history of coronary artery disease, which increases the risk of metastasis to the brain. The MRI findings of an intra-axial necrotic lesion with adjacent vasculogenic edema, primarily involving the right posterior frontal and anterior parietal lobes, are also consistent with metastatic carcinoma. Additionally, the patient's age and history of smoking increase the likelihood of a metastatic carcinoma.

The other options are less likely given the patient's symptoms and imaging findings. Hemorrhagic brain infarct (A) is unlikely since the patient does not have a history of bleeding disorders or recent trauma.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of abdominal distension, nausea, anorexia, and crampy abdominal pain, along with the physical examination findings of a distended abdomen and hyperactive bowel sounds, are consistent with a small bowel obstruction. The patient's history of similar symptoms occurring previously and self-resolving suggests that she may have had a previous episode of small bowel obstruction. The laboratory results, including a normal white blood cell count and sodium level, do not support the diagnosis of acute lymphadenitis (Answer A). An inguinal hernia (Answer B) would not explain the patient's symptoms of abdominal distension and crampy pain, and a femoral hernia (Answer C) is less likely given the patient's age and lack of a history of previous hernia repair. An obturator hernia (Answer D) is also less likely given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. The computed tomographic scan showing a mass lesion in the right lower pelvic wall supports the diagnosis of an inguinal hernia.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of generalized weakness and bilateral lower extremity swelling, along with the large, taut, and distended abdomen, are consistent with a retroperitoneal mass. The displacement of the descending colon and the absence of hydronephrosis suggest that the mass is likely to be located in the retroperitoneum. A renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most likely diagnosis, as it is a common type of kidney cancer that can cause a retroperitoneal mass. Retroperitoneal fibrosis (Ormond disease) is a rare condition that can also cause a retroperitoneal mass, but it typically does not cause bilateral lower extremity swelling. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a rare tumor that can occur in the retroperitoneum, but it typically does not cause bilateral lower extremity swelling. Retroperitoneal liposarcoma is a rare tumor that can occur in the retroperitoneum, but it typically does not cause bilateral lower extremity swelling.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of blurry vision, eye redness, and headaches, along with the physical findings of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and endothelial cell loss, suggest that he may have developed glaucoma. The fact that his IOP is reproducibly higher in the right eye and his central corneal thickness is within normal limits suggests that he may have developed primary open-angle glaucoma. The patient's history of eye color change surgery and laser in situ karatomileusis surgery may also be relevant to his overall ocular health and potential treatment plan, but they are not directly related to his current symptoms and findings. Therefore, the next step would be to perform visual field testing to assess the patient's peripheral vision and determine the extent of any potential glaucomatous damage.

Answer: C. Offer carbamazepine and routine MRI.
Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of intermittent esotropia and anisocoria, along with the history of pituitary adenoma resection and external beam radiation, suggest a possible diagnosis of cranial nerve VI palsy. Carbamazepine is a medication that is commonly used to treat cranial nerve palsies, and it may help to alleviate the patient's symptoms. Additionally, a routine MRI is necessary to assess the status of the residual tumor and to rule out any other potential causes of the patient's symptoms. Therefore, option C is the most appropriate next step in management.

Option A, topical apraclonidine test, may be useful in diagnosing and managing cranial nerve III palsy, but it is not directly relevant to the patient's symptoms of intermittent esotropia and anisocoria.

Option B, urgent MRI, may be appropriate if the patient's symptoms were rapidly worsening or if there were concerns about a more urgent underlying cause, but the patient's symptoms have been persistent for years, and there is no indication of a sudden change in their condition.

Option D, extraocular muscle surgery, may be necessary in some cases of cranial nerve palsy, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management for this patient, as the symptoms are not primarily related to extraocular muscle dysfunction.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with Sweet syndrome, a rare autoimmune disorder that often presents with fever, neutrophilic infiltration of the skin, and painful skin lesions. The patient's history of acute rheumatic fever and the presence of painful skin lesions on his elbows, forearms, and legs, which are not typical of pyoderma gangrenosum, support this diagnosis. Additionally, the punch biopsy results showing a dermal neutrophilic infiltrate with normal Gram and Grocott methenamine silver stains are consistent with Sweet syndrome. Pyoderma gangrenosum typically presents with ulcerative skin lesions and a history of trauma or surgery, which is not mentioned in the case. Papillary dermal edema is a feature of Sweet syndrome, but it is not the primary diagnosis. Pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta is a rare skin condition that can present with similar skin lesions, but it typically affects younger children and has a more acute onset.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient has recurrent atrial fibrillation (AF) and has already tried medications such as flecainide and warfarin without sustained success. Given the patient's history of recurrent AF and the presence of dilated atria and pulmonary veins, it is likely that the patient has structural heart disease that is contributing to the arrhythmia. Implanting a cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) would provide the patient with protection from sudden cardiac death, which is a risk associated with AF. Additionally, evaluating the patient for cardiac transplantation would be appropriate given the patient's young age and the presence of advanced structural heart disease. Starting a diuretic and beta-blocker may help manage symptoms, but it would not address the underlying cause of the arrhythmia. Discontinuing flecainide and starting amiodarone and warfarin may also be appropriate, but it would not provide the same level of protection against sudden cardiac death as an ICD. Proceeding with electrophysiology study and AF ablation may be considered, but it would not be the most appropriate next step given the patient's history of recurrent AF and the presence of advanced structural heart disease.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of a 4-month history of a 2.0-cm mass in her right supraclavicular region, along with the physical examination findings of a palpable, nontender, and freely movable mass, are consistent with a soft tissue mass. The imaging findings of a 2.0-cm, right-sided supraclavicular mass just anterior and superior to the right subclavian vein with central patches of hypoattenuation, and the subsequent ultrasonography-guided core needle biopsy findings of a benign spindle cell proliferation arranged in a tissue-culture–like pattern with a myxoid to collagenous stroma, are also consistent with a soft tissue mass. The immunohistochemical stains demonstrating the cells to be positive for actin and negative for cytokeratin and S100 protein, support the diagnosis of a low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

Option A, proliferative myositis, is an inflammatory condition that affects the muscles and is characterized by an abnormal increase in the number of muscle fibers. It is not consistent with the patient's symptoms or imaging findings.

Option B, myositis ossificans, is a rare condition characterized by the formation of bone within muscles. It is not consistent with the patient's symptoms or imaging findings.

Option D, nodular fasciitis, is a benign condition characterized by the proliferation of fascial tissue. It is not consistent with the patient's symptoms or imaging findings.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and the radiologic findings are consistent with an odontogenic myxofibroma. This is a benign tumor that arises from the periodontal membrane and is usually associated with the roots of teeth, as seen in this case. The histopathologic features, such as a bland, monotonous proliferation of stellate spindled cells with a variable extracellular matrix, are also consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the permeation of adjacent bone marrow spaces supports this diagnosis. Fibrous dysplasia (option A) is a developmental disorder that affects the bone and soft tissues, but it does not have the same histopathologic features as odontogenic myxofibroma. Ameloblastic fibroma (option B) is a rare benign tumor that affects the jaw and is associated with the development of teeth, but it has a different histopathologic appearance than odontogenic myxofibroma. Giant cell granuloma (option D) is a benign lesion that can affect the jaw, but it has a different clinical and radiologic appearance than the present case.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of severe diffuse sore throat, fevers, chills, night sweats, and neck swelling, as well as the presence of bilateral tender lymphadenopathy and necrotic skin changes, are consistent with tularemia. The negative gram stain and cultures for bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacillus, as well as the negative PCR for Bartonella henselae, suggest that the infection is not caused by a typical bacterial or fungal pathogen. The positive Francisella tularensis serum antibody titers of 1:640 further support the diagnosis of tularemia. The presence of necrotizing granulomatous inflammation on final pathologic examination is also consistent with tularemia. Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease is a rare condition that is characterized by lymphadenitis and fever, but it typically affects younger patients and has a more benign course. Cat-scratch disease is caused by Bartonella henselae and is characterized by lymphadenopathy and a history of cat scratch or exposure, which is not present in this case. Tuberculous lymphadenitis is a possibility, but the negative cultures and PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis make it less likely.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of nasal congestion, facial pressure, purulent rhinorrhea, and hypo-osmia, along with the physical findings of bilateral turbinate hypertrophy and significant nasal crusting, are consistent with rhinosinusitis. The patient's history of chronic rhinosinusitis, allergic rhinitis, and asthma, as well as the normal laboratory results from an autoimmune workup, suggest that the rhinosinusitis is likely caused by an infectious agent rather than an autoimmune disorder. The patient's recent exposure to tuberculosis and the presence of noncaseating granulomatous inflammation on superficial parotid biopsy support the diagnosis of tuberculosis. The patient's bilateral parotid swelling and tenderness are also consistent with tuberculosis, as the parotid glands are a common site of involvement in the disease. The absence of masses or sialoliths on radiologic imaging and the negative results for SSa/SSb levels, HIV, PCR, mumps titers, rapid plasma reagin, amylase, cytomegalovirus PCR, and quantiferon testing further support the diagnosis of tuberculosis. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Tuberculosis.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as a mass in the region of the left parotid gland that has been steadily increasing in size, and the results of the fine-needle aspiration, which were consistent with a cystic oncocytic neoplasm, suggest that the patient has a cystic neoplasm in the parotid gland. The patient's history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2 also supports this diagnosis, as these conditions are commonly associated with parotid gland tumors. The patient's age, a nonsmoking man in his 40s, is also consistent with the demographics of patients who typically develop low-grade cribriform cystadenocarcinoma.

The patient's symptoms and the results of the fine-needle aspiration do not support the diagnosis of papillary cystic acinic cell carcinoma (option A), as this type of tumor typically presents with pain or facial weakness, and the cystic fluid often contains blood. The patient's age and the absence of palpable lymphadenopathy also argue against this diagnosis.

The patient's symptoms and the results of the fine-needle aspiration do not support the diagnosis of Warthin tumor (option C), as this type of tumor typically presents with a painless mass in the parotid gland and does not have the cystic and papillary features described in the patient's case.

The patient's symptoms and the results of the fine-needle aspiration do not support the diagnosis of mammary analogue secretory carcinoma (option D), as this type of tumor typically presents with a painless mass in the parotid gland and has a more aggressive clinical course than what is described in the patient's case.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, medical history, and the results of the fine-needle aspiration, the most likely diagnosis is low-grade cribriform cystadenocarcinoma (option B).

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of fever, shortness of breath, chest pain, and lower extremity edema, along with the physical examination findings of tachycardia, decreased breath sounds, and bilateral cutaneous necrosis of the pinnae, suggest a possible diagnosis of vasculitis. The laboratory findings of leukocytosis with a high neutrophil count, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and thrombocytopenia also support this diagnosis. The presence of a deep venous thrombosis and pleural effusion further suggest a possible diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome, which is a autoimmune disorder that can cause vasculitis and blood clots.

Therefore, the next step would be to obtain serum antinuclear antibody and lupus anticoagulant assay to confirm the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome. This is the most appropriate answer among the options given.

Option A, performing a skin biopsy with indirect immunofluorescence, may be useful in diagnosing certain skin conditions, but it is not the most appropriate step in this case given the patient's systemic symptoms and laboratory findings.

Option C, obtaining a bacterial culture of the skin lesions, is not necessary at this point, as the patient does not have any signs of skin infection, and the skin lesions are likely a result of the underlying vasculitis.

Option D, obtaining a urine drug screen, is not relevant to the patient's symptoms or diagnosis.

Explanation: The patient's history of long-standing pulmonary arterial hypertension and the physical examination findings of jugular venous distension, an accentuated P2, and a holosystolic murmur suggest that she has chronically elevated pressures on the right side of the heart. This can lead to the development of neurological syndromes, such as ascites, as a result of increased pressure in the portal vein system. The patient's lack of liver disease history and the absence of lesions or cirrhosis on Doppler ultrasound support this diagnosis. Therefore, option B is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of arthralgia and fever, along with the presence of a painful rash on the extensor surfaces of his lower and upper extremities, suggest a possible diagnosis of vasculitis. The patient's history of autoimmune hepatitis increases the likelihood of this diagnosis. Corticosteroids are commonly used to treat vasculitis, so the best next step would be to commence corticosteroids.

It is unlikely that the patient's symptoms are related to azathioprine, as the drug was started 10 days prior to presentation and the patient's symptoms have been present for only 2 days. Therefore, stopping azathioprine (option B) would not be the best next step.

Checking the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level (option A) may be useful in diagnosing autoimmune hepatitis, but it would not be the most appropriate next step given the patient's symptoms.

Performing a punch skin biopsy (option D) may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of vasculitis, but it would not be the best next step before initiating corticosteroid therapy.

The tumor screening test results show loss of expression of MLH1 and MSH6 proteins, which is consistent with Lynch syndrome. However, the MSI-1 result was negative, which may indicate that the patient's tumor has a different mechanism of genomic instability.

Answer: C 
Explanation: The patient's sudden onset of ulcerative papules and nodules on the face and genitals, along with the absence of lymphadenopathy and the presence of umbilication, are consistent with eruptive keratoacanthomas (EKA). EKA is a benign condition characterized by the rapid development of numerous small keratinocytic tumors that often appear on sun-exposed areas. The lesions typically have a central crust or umbilicus and may be accompanied by pruritus or pain. The patient's history of remote cocaine use may also be relevant, as cocaine has been associated with EKA in some cases. The other options, atypical mycobacterium infection, cryptococcal infection, and secondary syphilis, can also cause skin lesions, but the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not support these diagnoses. The absence of any recent sexual activity, fevers, chills, nausea, or vomiting also makes secondary syphilis less likely. The patient's age and medical history, including hypertension, cerebrovascular accident, and colon cancer, increase the likelihood of EKA.

Explanation: The patient's history of Crohn disease and the presence of a dermal perivascular and nodular infiltrate composed of aggregates of histiocytes and numerous multinucleate giant cells surrounded by mature lymphocytes on biopsy are consistent with a granulomatous manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease. The absence of acid-fast and silver stains supports this diagnosis, as these stains are typically used to diagnose bacterial or fungal infections, which are not characteristic of granulomatous inflammation. The patient's lack of active gastrointestinal symptoms and the presence of perianal skin growths also support this diagnosis, as granulomatous inflammation can occur in the skin and other organs outside of the gastrointestinal tract in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The other options, fibroepithelial polyps, external hemorrhoids, and condyloma acuminata, do not fit the patient's symptoms and biopsy results.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results, along with the histopathological analysis of the punch biopsy specimen, are consistent with cutaneous sparganosis. The presence of eosinophilic cuticle and calcareous bodies in the histopathological analysis supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's exposure to well water and lack of travel or wading in local water sources suggests that the infection was likely acquired through contact with contaminated water. While Gnathostomiasis and Strongyloidiasis can also cause cutaneous manifestations, the presence of calcareous bodies and the absence of other symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss, make cutaneous sparganosis a more likely diagnosis. Myiasis is unlikely as there is no evidence of fly larvae in the skin.

Answer: C
Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of acute-onset upper abdominal pain, localized to the epigastrium, and tenderness in the same area during physical examination, along with the presence of anemia, are consistent with a diagnosis of a calcified bowel mass. The lesion-in-lesion appearance of the rounded radio-opaque lesion in the abdominal radiography also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's occupation as a sheep breeder and close contact with animals for extended periods increases the likelihood of a bowel mass.

Gallstones (option B) can also cause abdominal pain, but the patient's pain is localized to the epigastrium, which is less common in gallstone disease. Moreover, gallstones are unlikely to cause anemia.

A calcified hydatid cyst (option A) is a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's symptoms and occupation. Hydatid disease is more common in areas where sheep are raised, but the patient's symptoms do not suggest a hydatid cyst.

A swallowed foreign body (option D) is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and medical history.

Therefore, option C, a calcified bowel mass, is the most likely diagnosis.

Explanation: The patient's history of a cystic mass in the spleen, mild tenderness over the posterior left upper quadrant, and the laboratory test results, including a mild increase in the carbohydrate antigen 72-4 level, are all consistent with a congenital splenic cyst. The appearance of the cyst on computed tomography, with mural calcification and an eggshell-like calcification on the surface, and the presence of yellowish opalescent fluid containing cholesterol-like crystals, are also consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the fact that the cyst was not enhanced in the arterial phase of the computed tomographic scan suggests that it is not a vascular lesion, which supports the diagnosis of a congenital splenic cyst. Therefore, option B, Congenital splenic cyst, is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: D Obtain erythrocyte sedimentation rate  and C-reactive protein level.
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of sudden bilateral vision loss, along with the physical examination findings of bilateral optic nerve pallor and attenuated retinal vessels, suggest a possible inflammatory or infectious etiology. The presence of postmenopausal bleeding also raises the possibility of an underlying systemic inflammatory condition. Therefore, it would be appropriate to obtain inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) level to help determine the underlying cause of the vision loss.

Option A, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits with gadolinium, may be necessary later on in the evaluation, but it is not the most appropriate next step.

Option B, testing for antiretinal antibodies, may be relevant in certain cases of sudden vision loss, but it is not the most likely cause in this patient's presentation.

Option C, syphilis and tuberculosis testing, may also be considered in the differential diagnosis, but it is not the most likely cause given the patient's symptoms and examination findings.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as painless vision loss, temporal hyperemia, and a whitish lesion in the superotemporal quadrant, are consistent with a choroidal tumor. The presence of subretinal fluid at the fovea suggests that the tumor is causing fluid accumulation and potentially threatening the central vision. Oral prednisone therapy is a reasonable next step to reduce inflammation and potentially shrink the tumor, thereby improving vision. It is important to note that the patient's age and lack of other symptoms make metastatic disease unlikely, so referral to oncology for metastatic workups (option B) is not the most appropriate next step. Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbit (option A) may be considered later to further evaluate the extent of the tumor, but it is not the most urgent step. Transscleral or transvitreal biopsy (option D) may also be considered later to establish a definitive diagnosis, but it is also not the most appropriate next step at this time.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and clinical findings, such as blurred vision, vitritis, and retinal whitening, suggest a possible diagnosis of viral retinitis. However, the atypical presentation and negative aqueous polymerase chain reaction testing for common viral pathogens make the diagnosis uncertain. In such cases, a chorioretinal fine-needle aspiration biopsy can help in achieving a definitive diagnosis. This procedure involves collecting a sample of tissue from the affected area for further analysis, which can help identify the causative agent and guide appropriate treatment. Therefore, option C is the most appropriate answer.

Option A, broadening empirical antimicrobial coverage, may not be effective in treating a viral infection, and may lead to overuse of antibiotics.

Option B, performing vitrectomy with vitreous polymerase chain reaction, may be considered if the patient's condition worsens or if there is significant vitreous hemorrhage, but it is not the most appropriate step at this point in the patient's management.

Option D, referring the patient back to her oncologist, may not be the best course of action as the patient's symptoms and clinical findings suggest a possible ocular infection, which requires further evaluation and management by an ophthalmologist.

Embolization would help to reduce the vascularity of the tumor and minimize the risk of bleeding during surgery. Orbitotomy would allow for visualization and removal of the tumor, and biopsy would provide a definitive diagnosis.

Explanation: The patient's history of mantle chest radiotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma at age 17 years, which was curative, suggests that the patient has a high likelihood of having developed radiation-induced cardiac fibrosis. The patient's symptoms of progressive dyspnea on exertion and severe lower extremity edema, along with the physical examination findings of a regular carotid pulsation and discernible internal jugular venous pulse, are consistent with myocardial restriction. Myocardial restriction is a condition in which the heart muscle becomes stiff and cannot relax properly, leading to reduced cardiac output and increased pressure in the right atrium. The hemodynamic data shown in Figure 1B, which reveals a high right atrial pressure and a low cardiac output, supports this diagnosis. Therefore, option B (Myocardial restriction) is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C. Amyloidosis.
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and imaging findings are consistent with a diagnosis of amyloidosis. The patient's history of squamous cell carcinoma of the forehead increases the likelihood of this diagnosis, as amyloidosis can be a complication of certain types of cancer, including squamous cell carcinoma. The patient's lack of symptoms such as facial pain, weakness, numbness, trismus, or difficulty chewing, as well as the absence of cervical lymphadenopathy, are also consistent with amyloidosis. The imaging findings, including the loss of the fat plane between the parapharyngeal space and masticator space, and the effacement of the pharyngeal mucosa of the left lateral pharyngeal wall, are also consistent with amyloidosis. The histopathological findings, including the presence of confluent amorphous eosinophilic masses with surrounding foreign-body giant cell reaction and lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates, and the positivity of the sheets of plasma cells for κ and CD138 and negativity for λ, are also consistent with amyloidosis. Finally, the Congo red stain showing apple-green birefringence demonstrated on polarized microscopy is diagnostic of amyloidosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of hoarseness, throat pain, dysphagia, and odynophagia, along with the physical examination findings of a "breathy" voice and no respiratory distress or cervical lymphadenopathy, suggest a laryngeal etiology. The patient's history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome, and neutropenic sepsis increases the likelihood of a hematologic malignancy. The computed tomography (CT) scan and flexible nasal endoscopy findings of a right-sided laryngeal mass extending from the level of the free margin of the epiglottis to the level of the glottis, and the polypoid mass seen on direct laryngoscopy, are consistent with a laryngeal tumor. The histopathologic analysis demonstrating a mixed infiltrate containing numerous mononuclear myeloid cells positive for myeloperoxidase, CD34, CD68, and CD33 but negative for CD117, supports the diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma of the larynx. Myeloid sarcoma is a rare extramedullary manifestation of AML, and the presence of numerous myeloid cells in the tumor supports this diagnosis. Therefore, option C, Myeloid sarcoma of the larynx, is the most likely diagnosis.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as a gradually enlarging mass on the tongue without pain or other symptoms, are consistent with osseous choristoma. This is a rare benign tumor that grows from the residual embryonic tissue that forms the tongue. The patient's age and lack of other symptoms also align with the typical presentation of osseous choristoma. The physical examination findings, such as the mobility and well-circumscribed nature of the mass, also support this diagnosis. The histopathological examination revealed a proliferation of mature bone with overlying mildly hyperplastic stratified squamous epithelium, which is consistent with the characteristic histological features of osseous choristoma. Therefore, option B, Osseous choristoma, is the correct answer.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of chronic bilateral nasal congestion, absence of facial pressure, pain, paresthesia, bleeding, dysphagia, or voice change, and physical examination findings of thick, clear to yellow mucus bilaterally in the nasal cavities and bilateral inferior turbinate hypertrophy, as well as the presence of a large, lobulated, flesh-colored mass filling the entire nasopharynx with an irregular surface and firm consistency, are consistent with a diagnosis of a nasopharyngeal mass. The absence of overt surface ulceration or bleeding and the lack of bony erosion on CT scan also support this diagnosis.

The patient's age and the presence of a nasopharyngeal mass also increase the likelihood of a diagnosis of extraosseous chordoma (EOC), which is a rare type of cancer that arises from the remnants of the embryonic notochord. EOC typically affects the nasopharynx and has a distinctive appearance on MRI, as seen in this case, with a hypointense signal on T1-weighted images and a hyperintense signal on T2-weighted images.

Thornwaldt cyst, a rare developmental anomaly of the nasal cavity, can also present with nasal obstruction and mucosal thickening, but it typically affects one side and is not associated with a mass. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a malignancy that can also present with nasal obstruction and mucosal thickening, but it typically affects the nasopharynx and has a different appearance on MRI. Meningocele is a rare congenital malformation of the meninges that can also present with nasal obstruction, but it typically affects one side and is not associated with a mass.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and imaging results, the most likely diagnosis is extraosseous chordoma.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's history of hypertension and laminectomy, along with the presence of blood in the urine, suggests the possibility of a kidney or bladder issue. Microscopic urinalysis is the most appropriate next step to confirm the presence of blood in the urine and to evaluate for other possible causes of hematuria, such as infection or kidney damage. A computed tomographic scan (Option A) may also be useful in evaluating the source of hematuria, but it is not the most appropriate next step. Referring to urology for cystoscopy (Option C) may also be necessary, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this time. Performing urine cytology (Option D) is not necessary at this time, as there is no evidence to suggest malignancy.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as irregular, dark brown, well-demarcated macules within prominent soft, yellow, papular protrusions in a Blaschkolinear arrangement on her upper arms, linear, atrophic pink plaques with focal erosions and crusting on the right flank, and extracutaneous features like syndactyly of the toes and ventral pterygium and dystrophy of the fingernails and toenails, are consistent with Incontinentia pigmenti (IP). IP is a rare genetic disorder characterized by skin lesions that typically follow a Blaschkoid distribution, which is seen in this case. The patient's history of intermittent inflammatory reactions localized to the affected skin lesions, which were reproducible in febrile states, also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the histopathological findings of close proximity of subcutaneous fat to the epidermis with attenuated collagen, as seen in the skin biopsy (Figure, C), are consistent with IP. Therefore, option C, Incontinentia pigmenti, is the correct diagnosis.

The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Epidermolysis bullosa with mottled pigmentation (option A) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by fragile skin and mucous membranes, leading to blistering and skin fragility. While the patient does have skin lesions, they do not have the characteristic blistering and skin fragility seen in epidermolysis bullosa. Focal dermal hypoplasia (Goltz syndrome) (option B) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by skin and subcutaneous tissue hypoplasia, leading to skin dimpling and atrophy. While the patient does have atrophic skin lesions, they do not have the characteristic skin dimpling and atrophy seen in focal dermal hypoplasia. Nevus lipomatosus superficialis (option D) is a rare benign skin tumor that typically presents as a soft, yellowish, dome-shaped papule

Answer: C
Explanation: Incontinentia pigmenti (IP) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the development of vesicles and bullae on the skin, which later evolve into hyperpigmented macules and patches. The condition typically presents in the neonatal period, and the distribution of the lesions is often linear or whorled. The patient's history of vesicles appearing on the 13th day of life and evolving into hyperpigmented macules over time, as well as the negative results for viral and bacterial cultures, are consistent with IP. Additionally, the linear arrangement of the vesicles and the absence of any other skin lesions also support this diagnosis. Congenital herpes zoster (A) is unlikely given the absence of any other skin lesions and the negative viral cultures. Neonatal pustular melanosis (B) typically presents with larger, more confluent lesions and is less likely to have a linear arrangement. Linear and whorled nevoid hypermelanosis (D) is a rare condition that may have a similar appearance, but it is not typically associated with vesicles or a history of infection.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as polyuria and polydipsia, and the presence of coalescing reddish-yellow papules in the axillae, are consistent with xanthoma disseminatum. This condition is characterized by the development of yellowish to reddish-yellow papules or nodules on the skin, particularly in the axillae, neck, and limbs. The histopathological findings, including histiocytes with foam cells, scattered lymphocytes, and few plasma cells, are also consistent with xanthoma disseminatum. Additionally, the presence of a classic wreath-like Touton cell and foam cells with histiocytes, as seen in the shave biopsy, supports this diagnosis. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

Option A, acanthosis nigricans, is a condition characterized by darkening of the skin, particularly in the axillae, neck, and groin. While it may present with papules or nodules, the skin changes are typically more widespread and not limited to the axillae.

Option B, eruptive xanthomas, are sudden appearances of yellowish to reddish-yellow papules on the skin, often associated with lipid disorders. However, the patient's laboratory results did not reveal any significant lipid abnormalities, making this option less likely.

Option D, axillary granular parakeratosis, is a condition characterized by small, rough, reddish-brown papules on the skin of the axillae. While it may share some similarities with xanthoma disseminatum, the histopathological findings are distinct, with a granular parakeratotic layer and absence of foam cells. Therefore, option D is less likely.

Answer: B
Explanation: Tolosa-Hunt syndrome, a rare condition characterized by unilateral pain, swelling, and redness of the eye and periorbital area, is the most likely diagnosis for this patient's symptoms. The patient's symptoms of a unilateral headache located in her left cheek, eye, and forehead, along with ipsilateral lacrimation, red eye, and periorbital swelling, are consistent with Tolosa-Hunt syndrome. Additionally, the fact that the patient experienced recurrent but less intense episodes of several hours' duration during the subsequent nights, with no symptoms during the following 14 days, supports this diagnosis.

Cluster headaches, which are characterized by unilateral severe headaches and autonomic symptoms, are not typically associated with eye or periorbital swelling, making option A less likely. A space-occupying mucocele of the nasopharynx (option C) would not explain the patient's symptoms of unilateral headache and eye swelling. Acute angle-closure glaucoma (option D) is unlikely given the patient's age and lack of symptoms such as eye pain, blurred vision, and photophobia.

The patient's history of chronic constipation and use of laxatives may also be relevant to the patient's overall health and potential treatment plan, but they do not suggest a specific diagnosis. There is no evidence in the case to support the diagnosis of a right inguinal hernia (A) or bilateral femoral hernia (B). The patient's history and physical examination do not suggest vascular occlusive disease (D). Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is diabetic neuropathy (C).

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of epigastric pain, weight loss, nausea, and vomiting, along with the findings of anemia and subtotal occlusion in the second part of the duodenum on upper gastrointestinal series, are consistent with gastric outlet obstruction. The absence of a mass on computed tomography and the presence of a duodenal ulcer with pinpoint stenosis on gastroduodenoscopy support the diagnosis of fibrosis owing to chronic peptic ulceration. The patient's age and symptom duration also increase the likelihood of this diagnosis. Duodenal carcinoma (option B) is less likely given the absence of a mass on computed tomography and the patient's age. Duodenal web (option C) is a rare condition and is not supported by the patient's symptoms or test results. Annular pancreas (option D) is also a rare condition and does not explain the patient's symptoms or test results.

Answer: D
Explanation: The clinical presentation of an ulcerated lesion on the eyelid margin, accompanied by mild edema, madarosis, and a tender preauricular lymph node, suggests a possible diagnosis of a cutaneous malignancy such as basal cell carcinoma (BCC) or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). The patient's history of general malaise and absence of vision changes, light sensitivity, or drainage from the eye also support this diagnosis. The histopathology results showing necrotic epithelium with multinucleated keratinocytes and cytoplasmic inclusions further support this diagnosis. Mohs micrographic surgery is the appropriate treatment for cutaneous malignancies of the eyelid, as it allows for complete removal of the tumor while minimizing damage to surrounding tissue. Therefore, option D, Perform Mohs micrographic surgery followed by reconstruction with flap, is the correct answer.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's presentation of a painful, vesicular rash around his eyelid and forehead, along with conjunctivitis, dendritic keratitis, and anterior uveitis, suggests a diagnosis of herpetic eye disease. The presence of minimal fluorescein uptake and branching corneal pseudodendrites on slitlamp examination supports this diagnosis. Discontinuing oral acyclovir and starting topical trifluridine would be appropriate to treat the herpetic keratitis and prevent further corneal damage. Obtaining a corneal culture (option A) may not be necessary given the patient's clinical presentation and the presence of herpetic lesions on the cornea. Human immunodeficiency virus testing and lymphocyte analysis (option B) may also not be necessary given the patient's age and lack of other indicators for HIV testing. Performing corneal topography (option D) may be considered in the future if there are concerns about corneal astigmatism or irregular astigmatism, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management at this time.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient has a history of CMV retinitis in the contralateral eye, and the current presentation of retinal whitening, hemorrhage, and vascular sheathing in the right eye suggests progression of the disease. Obtaining aqueous and vitreous samples for polymerase chain reaction/culture/cytology can help confirm the diagnosis of CMV retinitis and rule out other infectious causes of retinitis such as bacterial or fungal infections. Additionally, it is important to check the patient's serology results for exposure to infectious agents to determine if there are any other potential causes of the retinitis. Steroids would not be appropriate at this time as they can exacerbate CMV retinitis, and intravitreous voriconazole may be considered later if the patient is diagnosed with fungal retinitis.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as proptosis, hypoglobus, blepharoptosis, and retinochoroidal folds, suggest a diagnosis of dacryoadenitis. The MRI scan also supports this diagnosis, showing a well-defined mass in the lacrimal gland. The patient's response to intravenous methylprednisolone treatment, with near resolution of pain and improvement in vision, further supports this diagnosis. Therefore, the next step would be to perform an incisional biopsy of the left lacrimal gland to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of the disease. This would be the most appropriate choice, as it would provide a definitive diagnosis and guide further management. The other options, such as ordering a gallium scan or initiating antiviral therapy with acyclovir, may not be as relevant to the patient's current condition and would not provide a definitive diagnosis. Increasing the dosage of oral prednisone may be considered, but it would not be the most appropriate next step, as the patient's symptoms have already improved with the current dosage, and a biopsy would be needed to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.

Answer: A. Coxsackievirus A6–associated exanthem.
Explanation:
The clinical presentation of this patient, including the widespread pruritic rash with facial swelling and black streaks, is consistent with Coxsackievirus A6–associated exanthem. This virus has been associated with a distinctive rash, characterized by poorly defined, blanching pink-red patches and edematous plaques without epidermal change, as well as linear streaks on the skin. The patient's history of mild atopic dermatitis and treatment with diphenhydramine, cetirizine, and prednisone without improvement also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the absence of any known drug or contact allergies and the patient's normal development and growth further suggest that this is a viral exanthem rather than an allergic reaction. Therefore, option A is the most likely diagnosis.

The other options do not fit the patient's clinical presentation:

* Option B, phototoxic dermatitis (phytophoto), is unlikely given the absence of any history of exposure to a photosensitizing agent and the lack of characteristic findings such as blistering or erythema on sun-exposed areas.
* Option C, black-spot poison ivy dermatitis, is unlikely given the absence of any history of exposure to poison ivy and the lack of characteristic findings such as a linear streak or patches of vesicles.
* Option D, nickel contact dermatitis, is unlikely given the absence of any history of exposure to nickel and the lack of characteristic findings such as a well-defined patch of erythema and vesicles.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's history of previous malignancies, including bilateral retinoblastoma and an advanced malignant small blue cell tumor (interpreted as an olfactory neuroblastoma), increases the likelihood of a recurrent malignancy. The patient's symptoms, such as a rapidly enlarging forehead mass, and the findings on CT scan, such as an irregular mass in the right frontal, maxillary, and ethmoid sinuses with surrounding sclerotic and erosive bony changes, are consistent with a recurrent malignancy. The fact that the surgical specimen showed multinucleated giant cells and bizarre stromal cells suggestive of treatment effect, and that osteoid formation with fine calcifications and severely atypical spindle cells with mitotic figures were present in other areas, supports the diagnosis of osteosarcoma. Therefore, option C, Osteosarcoma, is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: D. Low-grade chondrosarcoma.
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, along with the physical examination findings and imaging results, suggest a possible diagnosis of a low-grade chondrosarcoma. The patient's age and the location of the mass in the anterior nasal septum are consistent with this diagnosis. The presence of internal matrix mineralization on the noncontrast CT bone window also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the histopathological image shown in Figure D suggests a low-grade chondrosarcoma, as it displays a proliferation of cartilaginous cells with a low mitotic rate. Chondroma (A) and chondroblastoma (B) are benign cartilaginous tumors that are less likely to cause the patient's symptoms or have the same imaging features. Cavernous hemangioma (C) is a vascular tumor that is unlikely to cause the symptoms or have the same imaging features as a chondrosarcoma.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of recurrent, slow-growing retropharyngeal lesion, along with the MRI findings of a heterogeneously hyperenhancing mass centered at the atlantoaxial joint, are consistent with a diagnosis of chordoma. Chordoma is a rare type of cancer that arises from the notochord, a remnant of the embryonic notochord that runs along the length of the spine. It typically affects the base of the skull and the upper cervical spine, which is consistent with the location of the mass in this case. The erosion of the upper dens, anterior arch of C1, and the basion also supports this diagnosis. Hemangioma (A) and vascular hamartoma (B) are benign vascular tumors that can occur in the head and neck, but they typically do not exhibit the same degree of bone erosion or growth as chordoma. Atypical meningioma (D) is a type of meningioma that exhibits atypical features, such as increased cellularity, mitotic activity, and necrosis. However, it typically does not have the same location or imaging features as chordoma. Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is chordoma.

Answer: B 
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and imaging findings are consistent with aggressive cholesteatoma. The presence of purulent discharge from the ear and the imaging findings of middle ear, mastoid, and infralabyrinthine involvement (Figure, A) suggest a severe infection that has extended beyond the middle ear and into the mastoid air cells. The large cerebellar lesion with rim enhancement on gadolinium-enhanced MRI (Figure, B) and the diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) images and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps consistent with cerebellar abscess (Figure, B-D) support the diagnosis of cholesteatoma. Cholesteatoma is a destructive and expansile lesion that can cause bone erosion and extension into surrounding structures, including the cerebellum. The patient's history of recent onset of severe headache, fever, and vomiting, as well as the presence of meningitis, also support the diagnosis of aggressive cholesteatoma. While option A, complicated acute otitis media, could also be a possibility, the patient's age and the presence of a cerebellar lesion make aggressive cholesteatoma a more likely diagnosis. Options C and D are less likely given the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive facial palsy, ipsilateral hearing loss, and decreased facial sensation, along with the physical examination findings of House-Brackmann grade III/VI facial palsy, hypoesthesia in the left trigeminal nerve distribution, and no left audiologic responses to bone or air stimuli, are consistent with a lesion involving the internal auditory canal. The imaging findings of a well-circumscribed lesion extending into the fundus of the internal auditory canal, with a fluid-fluid level consistent with blood products, and displacement of the adjacent cranial nerve V, also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the presence of linear areas of enhancement at the periphery and of internal septations after the administration of an intravenous contrast agent, are consistent with an endolymphatic sac tumor. Cholesterol granuloma (option A) typically presents with symptoms of mastoiditis and does not typically involve the internal auditory canal. Aneurysmal bone cyst (option B) is a rare, benign, expansile lesion that typically affects the long bones, and is not commonly found in the petrous apex. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (option D) is a rare, benign proliferative disorder that can affect various organs, but is not typically associated with the symptoms and imaging findings described in this case.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive pain and limited mobility in the left leg, along with the radiographic findings of a 15-cm area of moderate destruction in the proximal femoral shaft, are consistent with a diagnosis of solitary plasmacytoma of bone. The absence of any other focal abnormalities on the nuclear medicine bone scan and the negative results for lymph node enlargement on the CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's medical history of multiple joint replacements related to osteoarthritis increases the likelihood of a bone tumor. While fibrosarcoma (A) and primary lymphoma of bone (C) are possible diagnoses, they are less likely given the patient's symptoms and imaging findings. Fibrous dysplasia (D) is a benign condition and would not explain the patient's symptoms or radiographic findings.

Answer: B
Explanation: Obtaining trace element levels would be the next appropriate step in the management of this patient's persistent rash. The patient's history of metastatic mucinous appendiceal adenocarcinoma and the presence of a desquamating rash on his face, scalp, inguinal region, and perineum, accompanied by diffuse alopecia, suggest the possibility of a paraneoplastic dermatitis. Paraneoplastic dermatitis is a rare condition that occurs in association with certain types of cancer, including gastrointestinal malignancies such as appendiceal adenocarcinoma. Trace element levels, particularly zinc and copper, are often evaluated in patients with paraneoplastic dermatitis, as abnormal levels have been associated with the development of the condition. Additionally, the patient's history of TPN and recent surgical correction for an enterocutaneous fistula may also contribute to the development of a paraneoplastic dermatitis. Performing a skin biopsy (option A) may also be helpful in confirming the diagnosis, but obtaining trace element levels is a more appropriate next step given the patient's history and clinical presentation. Prescribing topical steroid cream (option C) may provide some symptomatic relief, but it would not address the underlying cause of the rash. Ordering a paraneoplastic panel (option D) would not be necessary at this time, as the patient's history and clinical presentation suggest a more specific diagnosis of paraneoplastic dermatitis.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's low-normal serum erythropoietin level suggests that she may have a genetic mutation that is causing her elevated hemoglobin level. The JAK2V16F mutation is a common genetic mutation that can cause polycythemia vera, a disorder characterized by an overproduction of red blood cells. Testing the patient's JAK2V16F mutation status can help confirm this diagnosis.

The other options are not correct for the following reasons:

B: Familial polycythemia is a rare disorder, and it is unlikely that the patient has this condition given her age and lack of family history.

C: Secondary causes of elevated hematocrit levels, such as dehydration or chronic hypoxia, are unlikely given the patient's normal physical examination and lack of other symptoms.

Explanation: The patient's presentation of being unresponsive, cold to the touch, and having a low blood pressure and heart rate are concerning signs of hypothermia. The patient's history of stroke and hypertension also increase the likelihood of a cardiovascular cause for the hypothermia. The absence of any acute pathology on chest radiographs and computed tomography of the head also support this diagnosis. Therefore, the next step would be to order active rewarming, which is option C.

It is important to note that option A, emergency coronary angiogram, may be appropriate if the patient had a history of coronary artery disease or if there were signs of myocardial infarction on the electrocardiogram. However, based on the information provided, there is no indication for an emergency coronary angiogram.

Option B, urgent temporary transvenous pacemaker placement, may be necessary if the patient had a bradycardia or asystole, but the patient's heart rate is within normal limits.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and clinical presentation are consistent with leukemia cutis with leukemic vasculitis. Leukemia cutis is a rare complication of leukemia, characterized by the infiltration of the skin by leukemic cells. The patient's history of AML, status post–nonallogenic bone marrow transplant, and subsequent relapse, as well as the presence of myeloid blasts in the blood and bone marrow, support this diagnosis. The patient's tender purpuric papules and plaques with central necrosis and hemorrhagic crusting on the scalp, as well as the presence of similar lesions on the right dorsal hand and left lower leg, are consistent with the cutaneous manifestations of leukemia cutis. The negative wound cultures and polymerase chain reaction studies for herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus infections also support this diagnosis, as leukemia cutis is not associated with viral infections. The patient's age and history of AML also increase the likelihood of this diagnosis.

The other options are less likely explanations for the patient's symptoms and clinical presentation. Disseminated intravascular coagulation (option A) is a complication of AML, but it is not typically associated with cutaneous manifestations. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis (option B) is a condition characterized by inflammation of blood vessels, but it is not typically associated with leukemia. Cutaneous mucormycosis (option D) is a fungal infection that can affect patients with compromised immune systems, but it is not typically associated with leukemia.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of sudden hearing loss and headache, along with the retinal findings of bilateral arterial occlusions, suggest a possible diagnosis of Susac syndrome. This is a rare condition characterized by the combination of retinal artery occlusions, hearing loss, and encephalopathy. It is important to note that Susac syndrome is a medical emergency that requires prompt evaluation and treatment.

Therefore, the next step would be to order a brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate for any intracranial abnormalities, such as inflammation or vasculitis, that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. This would help to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management.

Consulting otolaryngology for hearing evaluation (option A) may also be appropriate, but it is not the most urgent step in the patient's management. Ordering an echocardiogram (option B) may also be considered, but it is not as immediately necessary as the MRI. Ordering carotid ultrasonography (option D) is not relevant to the patient's current symptoms and diagnosis.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of flashes and floaters, along with the presence of vitreous cells and periarterial lesions on fundus examination, suggest a possible diagnosis of uveitis. Uveitis is a condition characterized by inflammation in the uveal tract and can cause symptoms such as flashes and floaters. The presence of periarterial lesions, also known as "snowflake" lesions, is consistent with uveitis. Given the patient's history of posterior vitreous detachment, it is possible that the uveitis is a result of a chronic inflammatory response to the detachment. Therefore, the next step would be to perform a fluorescein angiography and workup for infectious and inflammatory etiologies to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible causes of uveitis.

The presence of a foreign body in the eye and the skin lesions are consistent with the diagnosis.

The best course of action would be to excise the affected conjunctiva (option C) to remove the inflammatory tissue and prevent further damage to the eye. Starting systemic and topical antibiotics (option A) may be appropriate if there is a concern about infection, but it would not address the underlying cause of the condition. Removing the foreign body with forceps (option B) may be necessary, but it would not address the systemic nature of the disease.

The patient's history of recent weight loss surgery and use of an artificial tear solution suggest that the dry eye is likely caused by a deficiency in fat-soluble vitamins, such as vitamin A. Biopsy of the conjunctival lesions would be appropriate to rule out malignancy or premalignancy, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: Biopsy lesions to rule out malignancy or premalignancy.

The other options are not the most appropriate next steps in management:

A: Order anti-Ro and anti-La antibody testing: These tests are used to diagnose autoimmune disorders, such as Sjögren's syndrome, but are not necessary in this case given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

B: Measure vitamin levels, including vitamin A (retinol): While measuring vitamin levels may be useful in diagnosing a deficiency, it is not the most appropriate next step in management. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with dry eye syndrome, and the patient's history of recent weight loss surgery and use of an artificial tear solution suggest that the dry eye is likely caused by a deficiency in fat-soluble vitamins.

D: Ask the patient if she is taking any antibiotics or anticonvulsants: This information may be relevant in the patient's overall medical management, but it is not the most appropriate next step in addressing the patient's eye symptoms.

Answer: C 
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of sudden-onset upper abdominal pain and vomiting, along with the presence of a mass on imaging, suggest a possible obstruction or intussusception in the small intestine. The patient's history of gastric surgery increases the likelihood of a surgical complication such as intussusception. Additionally, the patient's stable vital signs and nondistended abdomen suggest that the obstruction is likely to be partial, which is consistent with jejunogastric intussusception. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (A) is a possibility, but the patient's symptoms and imaging findings do not strongly suggest this diagnosis. Gastric bezoar (B) is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and lack of history of foreign body ingestion. Gastric polyp with bleeding (D) is also unlikely given the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's presentation of severe hypercalcemia (elevated serum calcium level) and hyperparathyroidism (elevated parathyroid hormone level) suggests a diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism. This is a condition where one or more of the parathyroid glands become overactive and produce excessive amounts of parathyroid hormone, leading to an imbalance in calcium levels. The patient's symptoms of headache, facial swelling, and malaise are also consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of kidney stones and bilateral hydronephrosis (enlargement of the kidneys) supports this diagnosis, as primary hyperparathyroidism can cause kidney stones and other kidney problems. The other options, hypervitaminosis D, malignant neoplasm, and sarcoidosis, do not fit the patient's symptoms and laboratory results as well as primary hyperparathyroidism.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's presentation of hypocalcemia, hyperparathyroidism, and wrist deformities is consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism. The patient's high PTH level and low vitamin D level support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's refractory hypocalcemia despite supplementation suggests a resistance to PTH, which is a common feature of primary hyperparathyroidism.

The other options do not fit the patient's presentation:

A: Hungry bone syndrome is a rare complication of primary hyperparathyroidism, characterized by severe hypocalcemia, hyperparathyroidism, and bone pain. While the patient does have hypocalcemia and hyperparathyroidism, there is no mention of bone pain.

C: Chronic kidney disease can cause hypocalcemia, but the patient's normal phosphorus level and lack of other signs of kidney disease make this diagnosis less likely.

D: PTH resistance is a rare condition in which the body does not respond to PTH, leading to hypocalcemia. While the patient's refractory hypocalcemia suggests some form of PTH resistance, primary hyperparathyroidism is a more likely diagnosis given the patient's high PTH level and wrist deformities.

Answer: A
Explanation: The clinical presentation of fever, chest pain, and diffuse ST-segment elevation on the electrocardiogram (ECG) is consistent with acute pericarditis. The patient's history of hypertension, intracranial hemorrhage, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) increases the likelihood of a cardiovascular diagnosis. The absence of any murmurs, rubs, or gallops on chest auscultation and the normal cardiac enzyme levels also support this diagnosis. Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is less likely given the absence of any symptoms or signs of myocardial ischemia, and the ECG findings are not consistent with AMI. Acute aortic dissection is unlikely given the absence of any symptoms or signs of aortic dissection, and the ECG findings are not consistent with aortic dissection. A pericardial tumor is possible, but the clinical presentation and ECG findings are not consistent with a tumor. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is acute viral pericarditis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's presentation of progressive headache and left periorbital edema and pain, along with the presence of multiple osteomas covering the calvarium, is consistent with Gardner syndrome. This syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple osteomas, which are benign bone tumors, and other symptoms such as headaches, seizures, and developmental delays. The patient's family history, with a similar presentation involving his mother, also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's genetic analysis revealing a mutation in the APC gene at 5q21, resulting in a stop codon, is consistent with Gardner syndrome, as this gene is associated with the development of osteomas in this condition. Therefore, option C, Gardner syndrome, is the correct diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of a globus sensation in the throat and throat pain, along with the physical examination findings of a submucosal swelling in the right aryepiglottic fold and compression of the airway, are consistent with a supraglottic mass. The patient's history of hypertension, dyslipidemia, and cigarette smoking increases the likelihood of a neoplastic process. The MRI findings of a soft-tissue mass measuring 27 × 17 mm and causing deviation of the right aryepiglottic fold medially and compressing the airway, along with the positive S100 protein immunostain results, support the diagnosis of a schwannoma. Therefore, option C, Laryngeal schwannoma, is the most likely diagnosis.

Option A, Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, is less likely as the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest a malignancy. Option B, Laryngeal neurofibroma, is also less likely as it is a benign tumor that usually affects the neural tissue and does not typically cause symptoms of throat pain and globus sensation. Option D, Laryngeal paraganglioma, is rare and typically presents with symptoms of hypertension, palpitations, and sweating, which are not present in this case.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive dyspnea, nonproductive cough, and hypertension, along with the physical examination findings of bilateral linear bands along the vocal folds, are consistent with primary laryngotracheobronchial amyloidosis (PLTA). The patient's history of dyspepsia and diabetes also supports this diagnosis, as PLTA is often associated with gastrointestinal symptoms and has been reported in patients with diabetes. The computed tomography (CT) scan findings of numerous calcified subglottic and tracheal nodules extending from the cricoid to the left mainstem bronchus, and the biopsy specimens of representative lesions revealing amorphous, eosinophilic material with calcification, metaplastic ossification, and multinucleated foreign-body giant cells, are also consistent with PLTA.

The other options are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and examination findings. Endobronchial sarcoidosis (option A) typically presents with cough, chest pain, and fever, and is characterized by the presence of noncaseating granulomas in the lungs. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (option B) is a systemic vasculitis that can affect the respiratory tract, but the patient's symptoms and examination findings do not suggest this diagnosis. Tracheobronchial osteochondropathia (option D) is a rare condition characterized by the formation of bony or cartilaginous nodules in the trachea or bronchi, but the patient's symptoms and examination findings do not suggest this diagnosis.

Answer: D: Reaction to radiotherapy.
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of pruritic pustules and papules on the skin of the right breast, which developed two months after the last dose of radiation, suggest a radiation-related reaction. The distribution of the lesions, particularly the concentration in the submammary fold, is consistent with a radiation-induced erythematous and polymorphic eruption. The patient's history of a cold sore several years ago increases the likelihood of a radiation-induced herpetic reaction. The absence of any other significant skin changes or symptoms, such as fever or swollen lymph nodes, supports the diagnosis of a radiation-related reaction rather than bacterial folliculitis or herpes infection. Pityrosporum folliculitis is a possibility, but the patient's history and physical examination findings do not strongly suggest this diagnosis. Therefore, option D, reaction to radiotherapy, is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: B
Explanation: Myeloid sarcoma, also known as granulocytic sarcoma, is a rare type of cancer that develops in the myeloid cells of the bone marrow. It can present as an intraoral mass, as in this case. The patient's history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and the absence of any other obvious causes of the mass suggest that this is the most likely diagnosis. Squamous cell carcinoma (A) is a type of skin cancer that can occur in the oral cavity, but it is less likely in this case given the patient's history of MDS. Invasive aspergilloma (C) is a type of fungal infection that can cause masses in the oral cavity, but it is unlikely in this case given the patient's lack of immunosuppression and the absence of other signs of infection. Condyloma acuminatum (D) is a type of human papillomavirus (HPV)-related lesion that can occur in the oral cavity, but it is unlikely in this case given the patient's age and lack of other signs of HPV infection.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's history of an annular skin lesion with central clearing and peripheral flaking, as well as the presence of a tick bite, suggests that Lyme disease is a possible diagnosis. The pediatrician's decision to order serologic testing for Lyme disease and prescribe doxycycline based on the results is appropriate. However, it is important to note that serologic testing for Lyme disease may not always be positive in the early stages of the disease, and a negative test result does not rule out the diagnosis. Therefore, it is reasonable to complete the full 14 days of antibiotic treatment for Lyme disease, as option A suggests, and then repeat the Lyme disease serology in 1 month to evaluate the response, as option B suggests. This approach allows for appropriate treatment of the patient while also ensuring that the diagnosis is confirmed or ruled out. Option C, obtaining a skin biopsy for Borrelia burgdorferi PCR, may be unnecessary and invasive, and option D, discontinuing doxycycline and restarting topical antifungal cream, is not supported by the patient's history and physical examination findings.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's pancytopenia, particularly the thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, and the presence of macrocytes and teardrop cells on the peripheral blood smear, are consistent with bone marrow failure. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis should be obtained to evaluate for lymphadenopathy, which could indicate a hematological malignancy such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). The patient's history of hypothyroidism and recent initiation of levothyroxine therapy increases the likelihood of ALL. The patient's young age and presence of asynchronous nuclear and cytoplasmic maturation, nuclear budding, and multinucleation in the bone marrow biopsy also support this diagnosis. Therefore, option C is the most appropriate next step in management.

Option A, increasing the levothyroxine dose, may be appropriate if the patient's hypothyroidism was contributing to the pancytopenia, but it would not address the underlying cause of the bone marrow failure.

Option B, obtaining serum methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels, may be useful in evaluating for a vitamin B12 deficiency, which can cause megaloblastic anemia, but it would not diagnose the underlying cause of the pancytopenia.

Option D, sending parvovirus B19 serologies and polymerase chain reaction for viral DNA, may be appropriate if the patient had a recent exposure to parvovirus B19, but it would not explain the patient's pancytopenia and bone marrow failure.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's presentation of blue, painful skin discoloration on his toes and red, tender macules on his hands, along with the recent history of coronary angiography and coronary artery bypass graft surgery, suggests a possible diagnosis of calciphylaxis. Calciphylaxis is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition characterized by deposition of calcium in the skin and other organs, leading to painful skin lesions, ulceration, and organ dysfunction. The patient's kidney dysfunction, altered mental status, and elevated eosinophil count also support this diagnosis. Therefore, the next step would be to obtain serum liver function tests, lipase level, and ophthalmologic evaluation to assess for multiorgan damage, as well as to monitor the patient for any signs of further organ dysfunction. Starting heparin and discussing thrombolytic therapy with the patient may also be considered, as calciphylaxis is often associated with thrombotic events. However, obtaining chest computed tomography angiography (option A) may not provide the most relevant information for the patient's current condition, and obtaining surgical consult for amputation (option C) may not be necessary at this time.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as blue discoloration of the ears and brown deposits on the conjunctivae, are consistent with diffuse melanosis in metastatic melanoma. The patient's history of mild knee arthralgia and treatment with NSAIDs also supports this diagnosis, as metastatic melanoma can cause joint pain and inflammation. The fact that the patient's mother had noticed dark discoloration of her diapers in infancy, which was not investigated further, suggests that the patient may have had a congenital predisposition to melanoma. The punch biopsy specimen showing large pigment deposits in the dermis and adjacent to the cartilage also supports this diagnosis. Argyria (A) is a condition where the skin turns blue or gray due to exposure to silver or silver compounds, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms. Acute intermittent porphyria (B) is a metabolic disorder that can cause abdominal pain, neurological symptoms, and skin manifestations, but does not explain the patient's blue ears and brown eye deposits. Alkaptonuria (D) is a rare genetic disorder that can cause darkening of the skin and mucous membranes, but does not typically cause blue discoloration of the ears.

The presence of yeast forms on potassium hydroxide staining and negative Gram stain and herpes simplex virus polymerase chain reaction support this diagnosis. Additionally, the unaffected twin and the negative bacterial cultures from the skin and blood further suggest that this is not a case of neonatal candidiasis or bacterial infection.

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation and histopathological findings are consistent with classic Dowling-Degos disease. The reticulate hyperpigmentation and hyperkeratotic papules on the face, neck, trunk, and extremities, as well as the histopathological features of hyperorthokeratosis, epidermal acanthosis, and elongated epidermal rete ridges with bud-like filiform projections and suprapapillary plate thinning, are all characteristic features of classic Dowling-Degos disease. Additionally, the absence of nail or mucosal changes and the lack of dyskeratosis on histopathology also support this diagnosis. While Galli-Galli disease, Grover disease, and Kitamura disease can also present with reticulate hyperpigmentation, they typically have different clinical and histopathological features, such as more widespread involvement, follicular plugging, and periorificial accentuation, which are not seen in this case. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Classic Dowling-Degos disease.

Answer: D
Explanation: Given the patient's history of recurrent anterior chamber and vitreous inflammation, as well as the presence of a chorioretinal scar, it is likely that the patient has chronic recurrent pseudophakic endophthalmitis. This condition is characterized by recurrent inflammation in the eye following cataract surgery, and can be caused by a variety of factors, including bacterial or fungal infection, inflammatory conditions, or exposure to steroids.

In this case, the patient's symptoms and clinical findings, including large keratic precipitates, anterior chamber cell and flare, and a chorioretinal scar, are consistent with chronic recurrent pseudophakic endophthalmitis. The patient's history of recurrent inflammation and the failure of previous treatments, including topical antibiotics and steroids, also support this diagnosis.

Given the severity and recurrent nature of the patient's condition, the best course of action would be to perform a pars plana vitrectomy with removal of the intraocular lens and capsule. This surgical procedure would allow for the removal of any inflammatory material and the source of the inflammation, and would also provide a chance for the eye to clear up any existing inflammation and improve vision.

The other options, including restarting topical prednisolone acetate and/or ofloxacin eyedrops, repeating vitreous biopsy and intravitreal injection of antibiotics, and intravitreal and/or posterior sub-Tenon triamcinolone injection, may not be as effective in managing the patient's condition, as they do not address the underlying cause of the inflammation.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of severe eye pain, headache, and increased intraocular pressure (IOP) suggest that the Baerveldt drainage implant is blocked, leading to acute angle closure glaucoma. The fact that the IOP was stable at 7 mm Hg on postoperative day 11 but has now increased to 30 mm Hg suggests that the blockage occurred recently. The most appropriate next step would be to apply digital pressure over the plate to dislodge the obstruction, as this is a non-invasive and quick way to relieve the blockage and reduce the IOP. Repositioning the tube (option B) may not be necessary at this point, as the blockage is likely due to debris or inflammation and not due to the tube's position. Performing laser iridotomy or iridoplasty (option C) may also not be necessary at this point, as the goal is to relieve the acute blockage rather than to treat chronic angle closure. Performing vitrectomy (option D) would be an invasive procedure that may not be necessary at this point, especially given the recent increase in IOP and the presence of a functioning drainage implant.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation and imaging findings are consistent with a diagnosis of retinal rings, also known as retinal pigment epithelial atrophy or RPE atrophy. This condition is characterized by a ring of hypopigmentation in the fundus, often associated with clumped pigment deposits and outer retinal thinning. The presence of outer retinal foveoschisis and interruptions in the ellipsoid zone on SD-OCT are also consistent with this diagnosis.

The patient's history of systemic hypertension and heart failure increases the likelihood that the retinal changes are due to a genetic disorder rather than an infectious or inflammatory process. The absence of any history of serious infections, including tuberculosis and syphilis, and the lack of a positive family history also support this possibility.

Given the patient's clinical presentation and imaging findings, it is likely that the retinal changes are due to a genetic mutation affecting the retinal pigment epithelium. NR2E3 is a gene that has been associated with retinal pigment epithelial atrophy, and genetic testing may help to confirm this diagnosis. Therefore, the most appropriate next step would be to refer the patient for genetic counseling and potential testing for an NR2E3 mutation.

Performing an intravitreous injection of an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) (Option A) may be appropriate for treating age-related macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy, but it is not the most appropriate next step for this patient given the clinical presentation and imaging findings.

Ordering testing for antirecoverin antibodies (Option C) may be appropriate for patients with suspected autoimmune retinopathy, but it is not relevant to this patient's clinical presentation.

Performing a vitreous biopsy (Option D) may be appropriate for diagnosing certain retinal conditions, but it is not necessary in this case given the patient's clinical presentation and imaging findings.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of fatigue, muscle stiffness, joint pain, and unintentional weight loss, along with the fundus findings of bilateral microaneurysms and dot hemorrhages, suggest a systemic vasculitis, which can cause retinal vasculitis and macular edema. The fluorescein angiography findings of hypofluorescence without pooling or leakage of fluorescein dye over the area of neurosensory detachment, suggest an ischemic insult to the retina, which can also be caused by systemic vasculitis. Therefore, it is important to investigate the patient's systemic health by obtaining serum chemistry and radiographs of the extremities. Administering an intravitreous anti-VEGF agent (option A) may help to reduce macular edema, but it would not address the underlying systemic condition causing the retinal findings. Obtaining neuroimaging of the brain and orbits (option B) may be necessary if the patient's symptoms persist or worsen, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this time. Obtaining serum titers of viral antibodies (option D) may be necessary if the patient's symptoms suggest a viral etiology, but there is no indication of this in the given case.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of intermittent episodes of right hand and leg discoordination and paresthesia, along with the imaging findings of patchy enhancement in the left basal ganglia and corona radiata on brain MRI, are consistent with a diagnosis of carotid artery dissection. The near occlusion of the proximal left internal carotid artery and the string sign seen on cerebral arteriogram also support this diagnosis. Carotid artery dissection is a condition where there is a tear in the inner lining of the carotid artery, leading to a blood clot formation and occlusion of the vessel. This can cause symptoms such as weakness or numbness in the face, arm, or leg on one side of the body, difficulty speaking or swallowing, and vision problems. The patient's history of no antecedent trauma or neck manipulation and her young age also make carotid artery dissection a more likely diagnosis than carotid atherosclerosis or fibromuscular dysplasia. Carotid aneurysm is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.

Answer: C 
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including the rapid progression of purpuric nodules and ulcers, afebrile sepsis, and the absence of pus, are consistent with a diagnosis of streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS) caused by Streptococcus pyogenes. STSS is a severe, life-threatening condition that can occur in children and adults, and is characterized by fever, hypotension, and multi-organ failure. The patient's recent history of tonsillitis and negative blood and throat cultures suggest that the infection is likely to be caused by a viridans streptococcus, such as Streptococcus pyogenes. The absence of pus in the ulcers and the presence of an erythematous rim are also consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's C-reactive protein level of 404 mg/L is highly elevated, which supports the diagnosis of sepsis. The patient's age and recent vaccination history also increase the likelihood of this diagnosis.

Answer: B: Fibrous dysplasia
Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of gradual-onset hearing loss, whistling tinnitus, and occasional sharp otalgia, along with the physical examination findings of a smooth mass behind the left tympanic membrane and normal tympanometry results, suggest a lesion in the otic capsule. The imaging findings of an expansile ground-glass density lesion arising within the lateral aspect of the otic capsule, eroding into the lateral aspect of the basal and second turns of the cochlea and the tympanic portion of the facial nerve canal, are consistent with a fibrous dysplasia. Fibrous dysplasia is a benign condition that affects the bones and can cause hearing loss, tinnitus, and pain. The technetium bone scan showing a lesion in the temporal bone and a focus of increased uptake in the left lateral eighth rib, suggests that the lesion is likely a fibrous dysplasia. The patient's history of labyrinthitis 2 years previously and possible reduced hearing afterward, also supports this diagnosis.

Paget disease, otosclerosis, and exostosis are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and imaging findings. Paget disease is a condition that affects the bones and can cause hearing loss, but it typically presents with a more sudden onset of symptoms and is often associated with a history of recurrent otitis media. Otosclerosis is a condition that affects the middle ear and can cause hearing loss, but it typically presents with a more sudden onset of symptoms and is often associated with a history of recurrent otitis media. Exostosis is a benign bony growth that can cause hearing loss, but it typically presents with a more sudden onset of symptoms and is often associated with a history of recurrent otitis media.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's symptoms and imaging findings is fibrous dysplasia.

Answer: C
Explanation: The correct answer is C, Anaplastic (undifferentiated) thyroid carcinoma. The clinical presentation of a rapidly growing vascular mass within the thyroid, along with the patient's history of a multinodular goiter, suggests a malignant thyroid tumor. The pathology findings of pleomorphic epithelioid cells with enlarged, hyperchromatic nuclei, irregular nuclear membranes, and increased mitotic activity, as well as evidence of angiogenesis and formation of nests around areas with organizing hemorrhage, are consistent with anaplastic thyroid carcinoma. The strong membrane reactivity for CD31, confirming an endothelial origin of the lesion, further supports this diagnosis. Angiosarcoma (A) is a malignant vascular tumor that can arise in the thyroid, but it is less likely given the patient's history of a multinodular goiter and the absence of a hemangioma-like appearance on imaging. Multinodular goiter with hemorrhagic cyst (B) is a possible diagnosis, but the presence of pleomorphic epithelioid cells and increased mitotic activity argues against this diagnosis. Hemangioma (D) is a benign vascular tumor that can occur in the thyroid, but it is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and the pathology findings.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of worsening hoarseness over several years, along with the physical examination findings of a white sessile lesion on the vocal folds, are consistent with laryngeal actinomycosis. The histopathologic images shown in Figure B-D, particularly the Gram stain and Gomori methenamine silver stain, support this diagnosis as they reveal the presence of Actinomyces colonies. Additionally, the patient's age and lack of significant medical history make laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma less likely. Laryngeal candidiasis and amyloidosis do not typically present with a sessile lesion on the vocal folds and do not have the same histopathologic features as actinomycosis. Therefore, option B, laryngeal actinomycosis, is the most likely diagnosis.

The patient's symptoms of mild but worsening orthopnea that is exacerbated when lying down, along with the physical examination findings of a midline trachea and no significant thyromegaly in the neck, are consistent with a thymoma. Additionally, the intraoperative dissection following median sternotomy (Figure B) shows a mass in the anterior mediastinum, which is consistent with a thymoma.

The other options are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Teratoma (option B) is a type of tumor that can occur in the mediastinum, but it is less likely given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Lymphoma (option C) is a type of cancer that can occur in the mediastinum, but it is less likely based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings. Substernal goiter (option D) is a type of thyroid enlargement that can occur in the mediastinum, but it is less likely given the patient's physical examination findings of a midline trachea and no significant thyromegaly in the neck.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of sudden-onset severe shoulder pain, localized to the right scapula and radiating down the extensor surface of his arm, are consistent with radiation-induced myositis. The timing of the onset of pain, approximately 5 months after treatment, is also consistent with the expected latency period for radiation-induced myositis. Additionally, the patient's history of radiation therapy to the right lung field, which includes the shoulder muscles, increases the likelihood of this diagnosis. Rib fracture (B) is unlikely given the absence of any inciting events or trauma, and the patient's age and medical history make polymyalgia rheumatica (D) less likely. Metastatic non–small-cell lung cancer (A) is a possibility, but the patient's lack of symptoms and negative diagnostic imaging at 3 months post-treatment make it less likely than radiation-induced myositis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The result of the ERBB2 (HER2) test by immunohistochemistry (IHC) is equivocal (score 1+) and repeat testing is needed to confirm the status of the protein. Therefore, option C is the correct answer. The patient's breast cancer cannot be definitively classified as ERBB2 (HER2) positive or negative based on the current test results. Options A and B are incorrect because they suggest a definitive result, whereas option D is also incorrect as it refers to a different concept (histopathologic discordance) and is not relevant to this case.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's presentation of neck pain, stiffness, and periorbital edema, along with the physical examination findings of facial swelling, brawny periorbital edema, and woody induration involving the nape of the neck and upper back, suggests a diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis. This is supported by the patient's history of diabetes and obesity, which are risk factors for the development of this condition. The laboratory findings of an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level, as well as the imaging findings of degenerative changes at the C5-C6 level and marked increase in skin thickness posteriorly, also support this diagnosis. A skin biopsy from the upper back would be the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis.

Therefore, the correct answer is C: Obtain a skin biopsy from the upper back.

The other options do not address the likely diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis:

A: Measure 24-hour urine protein - This test would not provide information relevant to the patient's current symptoms or likely diagnosis.

B: Obtain a 2D echocardiogram - This test would not provide information relevant to the patient's current symptoms or likely diagnosis.

D: Obtain a thoracic computed tomography scan - While this test may provide some information about the extent of the patient's neck and back pathology, it would not be as specific or diagnostic as a skin biopsy for necrotizing fasciitis.

Answer: B
Explanation: Relapsing polychondritis is a rare autoimmune disease that causes inflammation and degeneration of cartilage and connective tissue. It typically affects the auricles, nose, and larynx. The patient's symptoms of bilateral auricular rigidity and immobility, as well as the physical examination findings of normal-appearing ears with increased rigidity, are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's history of difficulty trimming hair around the auricles and the presence of calcification on the CT scan also support this diagnosis. Chondrodermatitis nodularis helicis chronicus is a condition that causes nodular lesions on the ears, but it is not associated with bilateral auricular rigidity or calcification. Petrified ear is a condition where the ear becomes hard and stony, but it is not associated with inflammation or degeneration of cartilage. Scleroderma is a systemic autoimmune disease that can affect the skin and internal organs, but it is not typically associated with auricular symptoms.

Answer: C
Explanation:
The given clinical case describes a patient with necrotic and ulcerated plaques on the face and extremities, along with hypoesthesia and bilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy. The patient's history of numbness and spreading skin lesions, as well as the presence of thickening of the peripheral nerves, suggests a diagnosis of cutaneous small vessel vasculitis (C). This is supported by the histopathologic findings of vascular damage and inflammation in the skin, as seen in the punch biopsy specimens (Figure, B-D).

Erythema nodosum leprosum (A) is a complication of leprosy that presents with painful, erythematous nodules on the skin, but it does not match the patient's symptoms of numbness and ulceration. Lucio phenomenon (B) is a rare complication of leprosy that presents with nodules and plaques on the skin, but it is not associated with hypoesthesia or vasculitis. Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa (D) is a condition that presents with necrotic and ulcerated lesions on the skin, but it is typically associated with systemic symptoms such as fever, joint pain, and weight loss, which are not present in this case.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as the development of erythematous patches and plaques on the extensor surfaces of the arms and legs, and the presence of violaceous firm nodules on the joints, are consistent with multicentric reticulohistiocytosis. Additionally, the patient's history of itchy eruptions and occasional burning sensation of new lesions, as well as the absence of fevers, fatigue, myalgias, arthritis, shortness of breath, oral ulcers, and recent infections, also support this diagnosis. The punch biopsy specimen from a plaque on the right forearm (Figure 1C and D) would likely show a histopathologic pattern consistent with multicentric reticulohistiocytosis. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive cranial neuropathies and lumbosacral radiculopathies, along with the physical examination findings of facial weakness, bilateral lower extremity weakness, and fasciculations, are consistent with a diagnosis of leptomeningeal enhancement. The patient's history of recent lumbar vertebra 3–sacra vertebra 1 lumbar laminectomies and new-onset urinary incontinence also support this diagnosis. The patient's laboratory results, including a normal complete blood cell count, chest radiography, and cerebrospinal fluid studies, are also consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's whole-body positron emission tomography–computed tomography showing extensive leptomeningeal and nerve root hypermetabolism without evidence of a primary malignancy, supports the diagnosis of carcinomatous meningitis–primary adenocarcinoma of the lung. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Carcinomatous meningitis–primary adenocarcinoma of the lung.

Answer: D: Treat with intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor injection.
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and clinical findings, including painless vision loss, macular discoloration, retinal hemorrhages, and neurosensory retinal detachment, are consistent with exudative macular detachment (EMD). The presence of a rash and recent viral illness suggests a possible association with uveitis or a viral retinitis, which can cause EMD. The absence of anterior chamber or vitreal inflammation, afferent pupillary defect, and normal intraocular pressures supports the diagnosis of EMD. The patient's age and lack of systemic symptoms also suggest EMD as a more likely diagnosis than other potential causes of retinal detachment, such as retinal tears or retinal vein occlusion.

Therefore, the best course of action would be to treat the patient with intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injection, which has been shown to improve visual outcomes in patients with EMD. Observing the patient with follow-up in 4 to 6 weeks with SD-OCT (option A) may not be aggressive enough to address the underlying cause of the EMD, and may result in further vision loss. Starting oral prednisone therapy (option B) may be beneficial in reducing inflammation, but it may not specifically target the underlying cause of the EMD. Photodynamic therapy (option C) is not typically used to treat EMD.

Explanation: The patient presents with an asymptomatic intraocular mass in the left eye. The patient is otherwise healthy, and the mass does not appear to be causing any significant issues. In this case, the best course of action would be to monitor the patient with regular follow-up appointments to observe the mass and assess any changes over time. Biopsy (B) may be considered, but it is not necessary at this time, as the patient is asymptomatic and the mass does not appear to be causing any issues. Brachytherapy (A) is not necessary, as the mass is not causing any symptoms or issues that would require treatment. Ultrasound biomicroscopy (D) may be considered, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. Therefore, the best answer is C: Observation.

Answer: D: Digital subtraction angiography with embolization of carotid cavernous fistula.
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of pulsatile proptosis, chemosis, dilated conjunctival blood vessels, and a swollen upper eyelid, along with the enlarged superior orbital fissure and engorged orbital veins seen on CT scan, suggest the presence of a carotid cavernous fistula (CCF). This is a rare condition that can cause increased venous drainage from the orbit, leading to elevated IOP and proptosis.

The correct answer is D: Digital subtraction angiography with embolization of carotid cavernous fistula. This is the most appropriate next step in management, as it allows for visualization of the fistula and embolization to occlude the abnormal communication, thereby reducing the venous drainage and IOP.

Option A: Perform surgical plugging of the carotid cavernous fistula with a muscle patch, is not the most appropriate next step, as surgical intervention may not be necessary and may carry a higher risk of complications.

Option B: Conservative management, is not appropriate, as the patient's symptoms and signs suggest a more urgent need for intervention.

Option C: Trabeculectomy or drainage procedure, is not relevant to the patient's condition, as the issue is related to venous drainage and not aqueous humor drainage.

Focal seizures with postictal hemiparesis would explain these symptoms, as well as the patient's history of trisomy 21, which increases the risk of seizures. The patient's recent use of acetaminophen and oxycodone may have also contributed to the seizure activity. The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and medical history as well. Opiate-induced anamnestic recall of prior deficits would not explain the sudden onset of symptoms, and ischemic stroke and acute demyelinating disorder are not supported by the patient's history or examination findings.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, the location of the mass, and the results of the biopsy suggest a diagnosis of Warthin tumor. Warthin tumors are benign tumors that arise from the salivary glands and are typically slow-growing and painless. They are often located in the parotid gland, but can also occur in other salivary glands, such as the submandibular gland or the floor of mouth. The patient's age and the fact that the mass has been slowly enlarging over a period of weeks also support this diagnosis. The negative immunostaining for TTF-1, PAX-8, estrogen receptor, and thyroglobulin further supports the diagnosis of a Warthin tumor, as these markers are typically negative in salivary gland tumors. The low-grade hypercellularity and the presence of hyalinized fibrovascular cores are also consistent with a Warthin tumor. Therefore, option C, Warthin tumor, is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C 
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as a bulging, hyperemic left tympanic membrane and fullness of the postauricular, upper cervical region, are consistent with a diagnosis of Rhabdomyosarcoma. This is a type of cancer that develops in the soft tissues of the body, such as muscles, tendons, and connective tissue. It is not uncommon for Rhabdomyosarcoma to present with ear symptoms, such as otitis media, and the patient's history of autism increases the likelihood of this diagnosis. The CT scan findings also support this diagnosis, as Rhabdomyosarcoma typically appears as a mass in the soft tissues of the temporal bone. The other options, complications of otitis media, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and squamous cell carcinoma, do not fit the patient's symptoms and CT scan findings as well.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of hearing loss, discharge, and mild dizziness, along with the CT scan showing a soft-tissue mass in the mastoid and middle ear cavity, suggest a tumor in the middle ear. The histopathological examination reveals a polypoid lesion with typical papillary architecture, central fibrovascular cores, and dilated glandular structures, lined by a bland-looking single layer of high columnar/cuboidal epithelial cells, which is consistent with a papillary meningioma. The positive immunostaining for cytokeratin-7 (CK7), CK19, epithelial membrane antigen, and glial fibrillary acidic protein supports this diagnosis. The low proliferation index of less than 1% on Ki-67 immunostain also suggests a benign tumor. Therefore, option C, Papillary meningioma, is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's history of diminished smell, failure of the Penn smell tests, and absence of olfactory sulci and grooves on MRI are consistent with isolated anosmia. The patient's lack of other neurological symptoms, such as headaches or nasal discharge, and the absence of any masses or polyps on flexible fiber-optic examination of the nose also support this diagnosis. The patient's history of seasonal allergies and frequent cough and congestion may contribute to her diminished sense of smell, but they are not the primary cause of her anosmia. Cerebrospinal fluid leak (A) is unlikely given the absence of other neurological symptoms and the normal MRI findings. Sarcoidosis (C) is also unlikely given the absence of other symptoms and the normal MRI findings. Upper respiratory infection (D) is not a likely diagnosis given the patient's history of long-standing diminished smell and the absence of other respiratory symptoms.

Answer: B
Explanation: A branchial cleft fistula is a rare congenital anomaly that results from the incomplete closure of the branchial cleft during embryonic development. It typically presents as a draining sinus or fistula on the lateral side of the neck, often with a history of recurrent infections. The patient's symptoms of chronic purulent discharge from the skin of the lateral neck, despite previous attempts at surgical resection, are consistent with a branchial cleft fistula. The presence of a small tract extending from the skin of the lateral side of the neck to the left strap muscles, as shown on CT imaging, supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's taste of contrast material during the fistulogram suggests that the fistula is communicating with the respiratory tract, which is a common feature of branchial cleft fistulas. Therefore, option B (branchial cleft fistula) is the most likely diagnosis.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive bilateral lower extremity pain, particularly in the buttocks and thighs, and the physical examination findings of weakly palpable and symmetric femoral pulses and non-palpable pedal pulses, are consistent with peripheral artery disease. The elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and negative blood and urine cultures suggest an inflammatory process. The magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) findings of mild stenosis of bilateral subclavian arteries and an abnormal-appearing infrarenal aorta are also consistent with peripheral artery disease. Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a vasculitis that affects the medium and large arteries, including the aorta and its major branches, and can cause stenosis or occlusion of the affected vessels. GCA is also associated with an elevated ESR. Therefore, the diagnosis is most likely C: Giant cell arteritis.

Answer: D: Order magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of blurry vision, along with the physical examination findings of a dilated retina, suggest the possibility of a retinal vascular disorder, such as diabetic retinopathy or retinal vein occlusion. The patient's history of metabolic syndrome and uncontrolled hypertension further support this possibility. An MRI of the brain would be appropriate to evaluate for potential intracranial causes of vision loss, such as a stroke or tumor. Therefore, option D is the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation.

Option A, measuring hemoglobin A1c level, may be appropriate in the evaluation of diabetic retinopathy, but it is not the most immediate next step.

Option B, evaluating for hypercoagulable disorders, may be relevant in the patient's long-term management, but it is not directly related to the patient's current symptoms.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory results, including an elevated testosterone level, are consistent with PCOS. The other options are not correct because a normal fasting glucose level does not exclude abnormal glucose tolerance (option B), a normal luteinizing hormone-to-follicle-stimulating hormone ratio does not exclude PCOS (option C), and documentation of polycystic ovaries by ultrasonography is not required for the diagnosis of PCOS (option D).

Answer: C 
Explanation: The patient's history of type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) suggests that they are at risk for developing hyperkalemia. The patient's recent treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, which can cause hyperkalemia as a side effect, supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's symptoms of generalized weakness and the absence of any other obvious causes of weakness on physical examination suggest that hyperkalemia is the most likely diagnosis. The patient's potassium level of 5.9 mEq/L is also consistent with hyperkalemia. Therefore, option C, "Pseudohyperkalemia," is not the correct answer, as it refers to a situation where the potassium level is falsely elevated due to hemolysis or lipemia, which is not present in this case. Options A and D are also not the correct answers, as they refer to drug-induced hyperkalemia and transcellular potassium shift, respectively, which are not supported by the patient's history or laboratory results.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including progressive, painful blisters and ulcers on the groin, perianal area, and buttocks, as well as the presence of purpuric macules on the lips, inframammary folds, forearms, and thighs, are consistent with a diagnosis of herpes simplex infection. The patient's history of numbness and difficulty with mastication, as well as the presence of macroglossia and glossitis, also support this diagnosis. The patient's age and history of IgG λ-type multiple myeloma complicated by anemia and lytic lesions in the calvarium increase the likelihood of a viral infection such as herpes simplex. The laboratory findings, including a low platelet count, prolonged prothrombin time, and activated partial thromboplastin time, are also consistent with a viral infection. The punch biopsy results, showing a subepidermal blister lined by fibrin and a chronic inflammatory infiltrate, are consistent with herpes simplex infection.

Answer: C: Granulomatous cheilitis
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of persistent, nontender swelling of the lips, erythematous papules at the vermillion border, and edema of the lower lip, along with the histopathological findings of a nodular, nonnecrotizing granulomatous dermatitis and the presence of epithelioid histiocytes with admixed lymphocytes, are consistent with a diagnosis of granulomatous cheilitis. This condition is a rare inflammatory disorder that affects the lips and is characterized by the formation of granulomas. The patient's history of HIV and the presence of other skin conditions such as verruca vulgaris and dyshidrotic eczema may also support this diagnosis, as granulomatous cheilitis has been associated with HIV infection and other immune-mediated disorders.

The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and histopathological findings as well. Oral sarcoidosis (option A) is a rare condition that can cause swelling of the lips, but it typically presents with a more diffuse, non-tender swelling and does not have the characteristic granulomatous inflammation seen in granulomatous cheilitis. Postherpetic granulomatous reaction (option B) is a condition that can occur after herpes zoster infection, but it typically presents with a more acute onset and does not have the persistent, nontender swelling seen in this patient.

Explanation: The patient's history of multiple skin papules and nodules, as well as her family history of cancer, are consistent with Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome. This rare genetic disorder is characterized by the development of multiple benign skin tumors, including sebaceous tumors, as well as an increased risk of developing various types of cancer, including colon, breast, and kidney cancer. The patient's family history of melanoma and colon cancer in her paternal grandfather and father, respectively, also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the cup-shaped tumor demonstrated keratinocyte atypia with a central core of keratinaceous debris, which is consistent with the skin manifestations of Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome.

The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and medical history as well. Cowden syndrome, also known as multiple hamartoma syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple hamartomas, which are benign growths that can occur in various organs, including the skin.

Answer: B
Explanation: The crusted papule with surrounding erythema and induration on the left hip, as well as the positive fungal culture, are consistent with a cutaneous fungal infection. The patient's premature birth, acute respiratory distress, and necrotizing enterocolitis may have contributed to his immunocompromised state, making him more susceptible to fungal infections. The presence of fungal elements within the superficial dermis on biopsy supports this diagnosis. While option A, pressure ulcer, may also present with skin necrosis, it is less likely given the patient's age and lack of significant pressure on the left hip. Option C, neonatal lupus erythematosus, is a rare condition that may present with skin lesions, but is unlikely given the patient's gestational age and lack of a history of maternal autoimmune disease. Option D, ecthyma gangrenosum, is a severe bacterial infection that may present with skin necrosis, but is unlikely given the patient's negative blood cultures and lack of signs of systemic infection.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of worsening abdominal pain, persistent pruritus, and scleral icterus, along with the physical examination findings of jaundice, fixed right supraclavicular lymph node conglomerate, and absence of cervical, left supraclavicular, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy, are consistent with vanishing bile duct syndrome. The patient's history of moderate alcohol consumption and negative human immunodeficiency virus test results on admission make acute hepatitis associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection (option A) less likely. The patient's age and absence of associated anemia make sarcoidosis (option C) less likely. The presence of a large extracardiac mass abutting the left atrium and multiple splenic lesions on computed tomography suggests a malignancy, which is consistent with metastatic cholangiocarcinoma secondary to primary sclerosing cholangitis (option D). However, the patient's history and physical examination findings do not support this diagnosis. The liver biopsy showing a portal tract containing both hepatic artery and hepatic vein branches, which is consistent with vanishing bile duct syndrome, further supports the diagnosis of vanishing bile duct syndrome associated with Hodgkin lymphoma (option B).

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's history of Merkel cell carcinoma and the presence of a metabolically active mass in the gastric fundus with intense 68Ga–DOTATOC uptake suggest a possible gastric metastasis of Merkel cell carcinoma. The patient's age and the location of the mass in the gastric fundus also support this diagnosis. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (A) and type III neuroendocrine tumor of the stomach (B) are less likely given the patient's history and the imaging findings. Gastric adenocarcinoma (D) is a possibility, but the patient's history and the presence of a metabolically active mass suggest a more aggressive tumor such as a metastasis.

Answer: B 
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and frequent urination, along with the incidental finding of a mass in the pancreas on a CT scan, suggest a possible diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. The patient's family history, with a first-degree relative (father) who died of pancreatic cancer at a relatively young age (65 years), also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the size and location of the mass in the tail of the pancreas, as well as the presence of thrombosis in the splenic vein, are consistent with pancreatic cancer. While cystadenoma (A) and hydatid cyst of the pancreas (C) are possible benign pancreatic masses, they are less likely given the patient's symptoms and family history. Main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia (D) is a type of pancreatic cancer that arises in the pancreatic duct, but it is typically associated with obstructive jaundice, which is not mentioned in the case. Therefore, based on the available information, the most likely diagnosis is pancreatic cancer (B).

Answer: D: Metastatic carcinoma.
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of intermittent epigastric pain, palpitations, and hot flashes, along with the echocardiogram and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging findings of multiple intramyocardial masses involving the left ventricle, aortopulmonary window lymphadenopathy, and moderate pericardial effusion, suggest a diagnosis of metastatic carcinoma. The patient's history of a remote ovarian cyst and cosmetic breast augmentation increases the likelihood of a primary malignancy elsewhere in the body, such as breast or ovarian cancer, that has metastasized to the heart. The absence of discrete masses or lymphadenopathy elsewhere on computed tomographic imaging supports the diagnosis of cardiac metastases. The nondiagnostic transcutaneous biopsy result also supports this diagnosis, as metastatic carcinoma can be difficult to diagnose on biopsy. Lymphoma (option A) and melanoma (option B) can also present with cardiac metastases, but the patient's symptoms and imaging findings are more consistent with metastatic carcinoma. Rhabdomyoma (option C) is a rare benign tumor that can occur in the heart, but it is not typically associated with metastatic disease.

Answer: D: Perform a screening test for syphilis (rapid plasma reagin)
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of a generalized nonpruritic, nontender rash, without fevers or other constitutional symptoms, could be consistent with a syphilitic rash. The rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test is a screening test for syphilis that can help identify the presence of antibodies against Treponema pallidum, the bacteria that causes syphilis. It is appropriate to perform this test next to help determine if the patient's rash is related to syphilis or another condition. Discontinuing trastuzumab (option A) may not address the underlying cause of the rash, and obtaining a skin biopsy (option B) may not be necessary at this point. Prescribing topical steroids (option C) may help alleviate symptoms, but it would not address the underlying cause of the rash.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of gradually worsening swelling and itching in the red ink area of the tattoo, along with the physical examination findings of marked swelling and keloid formation, suggest a possible infection or inflammatory response. The fact that there is no swelling or discoloration over the black ink area of the tattoo suggests that the issue is localized to the red ink area. Performing a punch biopsy and sending it for bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacillary cultures can help to confirm the diagnosis and identify the causative agent. This is the most appropriate next step in management.

Prescribing oral antibiotics (option A) may be appropriate if an infection is confirmed, but it is not the next step in management. Prescribing higher-potency topical steroids (option B) may help to reduce inflammation, but it is not targeting the underlying cause of the symptoms. Reassuring the patient and following up in 2 weeks (option D) may be appropriate if the patient's symptoms improve, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management given the patient's persistent symptoms and physical examination findings.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's probability of prostate cancer is approximately 6% for a high-grade cancer and 18% for a low-grade cancer. This answer is correct because the patient's slow rise in PSA level and enlarged prostate are consistent with benign prostatic hyperplasia, which means that the probability of prostate cancer is lower. The patient's PSA history shows a steady increase over time, which suggests a low-grade cancer is more likely. Therefore, option C is the best answer.

Option A is incorrect because it states that the patient's probability of prostate cancer is less than 10%, which is not supported by the patient's PSA history.

Option B is incorrect because it states that the patient's rise in PSA level means his probability of prostate cancer is more than 50%, which is not supported by the patient's PSA history.

Option D is incorrect because it suggests that the variability in the patient's PSA level makes it likely the tests were done in different laboratories, which is not relevant to the patient's probability of prostate cancer.

Answer: D
Explanation: The patient's exercise treadmill test (ETT) results show inferolateral ST depressions, which indicate obstructive coronary artery disease in the right coronary artery, the left circumflex artery, or both arteries. This is a significant finding that suggests the patient may have coronary artery disease (CAD). Therefore, further testing is needed to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate course of action.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

A: The patient's asymptomatic status and high exercise capacity do not necessarily rule out the possibility of CAD. In fact, many patients with CAD may not have symptoms until they engage in physical activity that stresses the heart.

B: While ST depressions during recovery are not necessarily normal, they do not necessarily indicate CAD. ST depressions can occur for various reasons, including cardiac arrhythmias, electrolyte imbalances, and medication side effects.

C: ST depressions of less than 2 mm may still be significant, especially if they occur in conjunction with other signs and symptoms of CAD. It is important to consider the patient's medical history, physical examination results, and other test results when interpreting ETT results.

Therefore, option D is the correct answer.

Additionally, the absence of signs of lymphangitis or lymphadenopathy, and the negative culture results for bacteria, support the diagnosis of leishmaniasis over cutaneous tuberculosis (A). Ecthyma gangrenosum (B) typically presents with smaller ulcers and is associated with Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection, which was not detected in this case.

Answer: B
Explanation: The clinical presentation of polycyclic, brown, partly livid shimmering macules on the skin, along with coarse facial features, hepatomegaly, lumbar kyphosis, and muscular hypotonia, is consistent with Morquio syndrome. Morquio syndrome is a rare genetic disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme galactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase, leading to the accumulation of keratan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate in various tissues, including the skin and bones. The characteristic skin lesions in Morquio syndrome are often described as "fish scale" or "shimmering" and can appear as polycyclic, brown, or reddish macules. The presence of coarse facial features, hepatomegaly, and muscular hypotonia also supports the diagnosis. In contrast, child abuse (option A) would not explain the other clinical findings, GM1 gangliosidosis (option C) typically presents with progressive neurological symptoms and cherry-red spots on the retina, and Hurler-Scheie syndrome (option D) is characterized by corneal clouding, joint stiffness, and short stature.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of subacute imbalance, gait dysfunction, confusion, and memory deficits, along with the imaging findings of mass lesions in the brain, are consistent with a diagnosis of central nervous system lymphoma. The patient's history of recurrent urinary tract infections, onychomycosis, and prior episodes of syncope also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of a living, unrelated donor renal transplant 12 years earlier and immunosuppressive therapy with tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil hydrochloride, and prednisone increase the risk of developing posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD), which can present as central nervous system lymphoma.

The other options are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and medical history. Option A, central nervous system toxoplasmosis, is unlikely given the absence of evidence of toxoplasma infection in the patient's serum and cerebrospinal fluid. Option B, metastatic carcinoma, is less likely given the absence of a known primary cancer and the patient's age. Option D, posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder, is a possible diagnosis, but the patient's symptoms and imaging findings are more consistent with central nervous system lymphoma.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of monocular nystagmus, failure to thrive, and emaciated appearance suggest a possible brain or spinal cord disorder. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and spine is the most appropriate next step in the diagnostic workup. MRI can help identify any structural abnormalities in the brain or spinal cord that may be causing the patient's symptoms, such as a tumor or cyst. Electrooculography (EOG) and visual evoked potential (VEP) tests may also be useful in evaluating the patient's visual system, but they are not as sensitive as MRI for detecting structural abnormalities. Blood culture may be necessary if there is a suspicion of infection, but it is not the most appropriate next step based on the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient has a history of latent extrapulmonary tuberculosis that was treated with antitubercular therapy, and the current presentation of choroidal granulomas involving the macula is consistent with tuberculous uveitis. The patient's history of avascular hip necrosis complicating corticosteroid therapy suggests that corticosteroid-sparing immunosuppressive therapy may be a better option than corticosteroid monotherapy. Initiating immunosuppressive therapy may help control the inflammation and prevent further vision loss. Consulting infectious diseases for alternative antitubercular therapy (Option A) may also be considered, but given the patient's history of tuberculosis and positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold test, it is likely that the current presentation is related to the previous infection. Injecting intravitreous triamcinolone acetonide (Option C) may provide temporary relief of macular edema, but it is not a long-term solution for the underlying inflammation. Performing pars plana vitrectomy with intravitreous methotrexate (Option D) may be considered in cases of refractory uveitis, but it is not the first-line treatment for tuberculous uveitis.

Answer: C: Orf
Explanation: Orf, also known as contagious ecthyma, is a viral disease that affects sheep and goats, and occasionally humans. It is caused by a parapoxvirus and is characterized by the formation of pustular lesions on the skin, particularly on the hands and face. The lesions typically begin as small blisters and then develop a crusty covering, similar to what is described in the clinical case. The patient's history of direct contact with sheep and cows, as well as the absence of any other likely causes of the lesion, suggests that orf is a likely diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's report of mild tender lymphadenopathy of the right axilla is consistent with the lymphadenopathy that is often seen in orf. Herpetic whitlow (A) is a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's age and the absence of any other symptoms or signs of herpes simplex virus infection. Cutaneous anthrax (B) is unlikely, as it typically presents with a larger, more painful lesion and there is no history of exposure to the bacteria. Sporotrichosis (D) is also unlikely, as it typically presents with a larger, more painful lesion and there is no history of exposure to the fungus.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of sudden-onset, progressively worsening dysphonia, dry cough, and sensation of a lump in the throat, along with the objective finding of a broad-based submucosal mass in the anterior two-thirds of the right true vocal fold, are consistent with a diagnosis of a true vocal fold myxoma. The location and size of the mass, as well as its disruption of vocal fold vibration, support this diagnosis. Additionally, the fact that the mass was deep to the epithelium of the true vocal fold and superficial to the vocal ligament, as revealed by the microdirect laryngoscopy, is consistent with a myxoma. Myxomas are typically encapsulated, as was the case in this patient, and are often tan-colored, as observed in the surgical specimen. The absence of any other symptoms or findings, such as heartburn, hemoptysis, or neck masses, also supports a diagnosis of a true vocal fold myxoma. Therefore, option C, True vocal fold myxoma, is the correct answer.

Answer: C
Explanation: The correct answer is C, Nasal angioleiomyoma.

The patient's symptoms of recurrent left-sided acute epistaxis, along with the clinical finding of a soft-tissue mass filling the left nasal cavity and based on the mucosal surface of the anterolateral nasal vestibule, are consistent with a nasal angioleiomyoma. This diagnosis is supported by the histopathologic findings of a broad-based soft-tissue mass with a cuff of grossly healthy submucosa, as seen in Figures B-D.

Angiofibroma (answer B) is a benign tumor that typically affects the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses, but it is less likely to cause epistaxis. Angiomyolipoma (answer A) is a rare benign tumor that is typically found in the kidney, and is not commonly associated with epistaxis. Hemangioma (answer D) is a benign vascular tumor that can occur in the nasal cavity, but it is less likely to cause recurrent epistaxis.

Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and histopathologic findings, the most likely diagnosis is nasal angioleiomyoma.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of dizziness, vomiting, unstable gait, and headaches, along with the laboratory evaluation revealing hyponatremia and the presence of a mass in the right maxillary sinus, are consistent with a diagnosis of esthesioneuroblastoma. This type of cancer is known to cause hyponatremia due to the excessive production of antidiuretic hormone. The patient's age and the presence of calcifications in the mass also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the histopathological images show a small, round, blue-cell tumor growing in circumscribed lobules and nests, which is consistent with the characteristic "salt and pepper" appearance of esthesioneuroblastoma. The tumor cells being diffusely positive for synaptophysin and negative for cytokeratin also support this diagnosis. Therefore, option C, Esthesioneuroblastoma, is the correct answer.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's history of a recent oral cavity lesion, which was not biopsied or followed up, and the absence of any known tuberculosis exposure, recent foreign travel, exposure to unpasteurized food, history of immunodeficiency, or alcohol or tobacco use, suggest that lymphoma is a more likely diagnosis than squamous cell carcinoma (A). The patient's age and the absence of any symptoms such as fever, chills, cough, dysphagia, or odynophagia also support this diagnosis. The bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy with central necrosis shown on the contrast-enhanced CT scans (Figure) is consistent with lymphoma. Tuberculous lymphadenitis (C) is less likely given the patient's lack of exposure to tuberculosis and the absence of any other symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis. Papillary thyroid carcinoma (D) is unlikely given the patient's age and the absence of any thyroid symptoms or abnormalities on physical examination.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of a dry cough, foreign body sensation in the throat, and mild dysphagia, along with the endoscopic findings of a submucosal pulsatile mass in the right retropharyngeal area, are consistent with an aberrant internal carotid artery. The imaging findings of an abnormal medial course of the right internal carotid artery and an aberrant internal carotid artery in the retropharyngeal space support this diagnosis. An arteriovenous malformation (Option A) would be unlikely to cause these symptoms and would likely have been detected on imaging. A cavernous hemangioma (Option C) would not explain the pulsatile mass and would likely have been detected on imaging. An internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysm (Option D) would also not explain the pulsatile mass and would likely have been detected on imaging. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is an aberrant internal carotid artery.

Cutaneous sarcoidosis can present with a variety of skin lesions, including annular and polycyclic scaly patches, as seen in this patient. The patient's history of chronic renal insufficiency and hypertension also increases the likelihood of sarcoidosis. Obtaining a chest radiograph would help to evaluate the progression of sarcoidosis in the lungs and determine if treatment is needed. Discontinuing pantoprazole (option B) may not be necessary, as there is no clear evidence that it is causing the skin rash. Starting oral prednisone (option C) may be considered, but it would depend on the severity of the skin rash and the patient's overall health status.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's recurrent painful abdominal rash, with no identifiable precipitating factors, suggests a possible autoimmune or inflammatory condition. The presence of vesiculation and central erosion on the plaque, as well as the minimal inflammation and atrophy of the epidermis, are consistent with a diagnosis of pemphigus, an autoimmune bullous disease. Pemphigus can cause painful blisters and sores on the skin, and it is important to rule out this diagnosis before initiating further treatment. Obtaining a skin swab for varicella zoster virus direct fluorescent antibody level (Option D) may also be helpful in diagnosing pemphigus, as this virus has been associated with the development of pemphigus. However, it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. Ordering laboratory studies for antinuclear, anti-Scl-70, and anti-centromere antibodies (Option A) may help support a diagnosis of autoimmune disease, but it is not specific to pemphigus. Obtaining a detailed procedural history (Option B) may help identify a precipitating factor for the rash, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. Performing patch testing for a possible contact allergen (Option C) is a reasonable next step, as it can help identify any allergens that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with a diagnosis of vasculitis. The presence of purpuric lesions and bullae on the skin, along with the patient's history of coronary artery disease and end-stage renal disease, suggest a systemic vasculitis. The patient's age and history of coronary artery bypass grafting also increase the likelihood of this diagnosis. The punch biopsy specimens obtained from the border of normal and lesional skin showed marked perivascular infiltrates in the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue, which is consistent with vasculitis. Additionally, the patient's neutrophil-predominant leukocytosis supports this diagnosis. Septic emboli (option B) are less likely given the absence of fever and the presence of purpuric lesions. Calciphylaxis (option A) is unlikely given the absence of metastatic calcification and the patient's history of coronary artery disease.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's history of pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis, combined with the presence of pruritic, pink scaling plaques on the face and trunk that worsen with sun exposure, are consistent with a diagnosis of lupus erythematosus (LE). The patient's positive antinuclear antibody titers and lymphopenia also support this diagnosis. The patient's negative results for antiribonucleoprotein, antihistone, antiphospholipid, anti-Smith, anti-Ro/Sjögren syndrome antigen A, and anti-La/Sjögren syndrome antigen B antibodies, as well as normal levels of C3, C4, CH50, rapid plasma reagin, and creatinine, suggest that the patient does not have certain other autoimmune disorders that may present with similar symptoms, such as pemphigus erythematosus or eczematous dermatitis. The biopsy results shown in Figure B and C, which reveal a lymphocytic infiltrate and interface dermatitis, are also consistent with a diagnosis of LE. Therefore, answer B, Lupus erythematosus, is the correct diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of Cryptococcal Retinitis. The presence of bilateral vitritis, hyperemic optic nerves, and extensive whitening of the retina, along with the patient's history of HIV infection and immune reactivation syndrome, suggest that the patient has developed a opportunistic infection. Cryptococcus is a fungus that can cause opportunistic infections in people with compromised immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS. The patient's recent history of fevers and fatigue also support this diagnosis.

The laboratory workup will likely show evidence of Cryptococcus infection, such as a positive cryptococcal antigen test or cultures positive for Cryptococcus neoformans. Therefore, it is appropriate to add IV penicillin G to the patient's treatment regimen, as it is effective against Cryptococcus infections.

Increasing the dose of corticosteroids (option B) may not be effective in treating the underlying infection and may even worsen the patient's condition by suppressing the immune system further. Continuing the same treatment (option A) without adjusting the medication regimen may not be sufficient to treat the patient's severe retinitis. Vitreous tap/biopsy (option D) may be considered later if the patient's condition does not improve with medical treatment, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this time.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of vision loss, paresthesias, and posterior headache, along with the physical examination findings of a central scotoma and decreased sensation to light touch, vibration, and temperature in his left upper and lower extremities, suggest the possibility of a neuro-ophthalmic disorder. The presence of subretinal and retinal pigment epithelial lesions (arrowheads) in the left eye, as seen in Figure 1, supports this diagnosis. The patient's history of epilepsy and recent eye redness also suggest the possibility of a posterior uveitis or other inflammatory condition.

Given these findings, the next step would be to obtain a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to further evaluate the patient's neurological symptoms and rule out any intracranial causes of his symptoms. MRI is the imaging modality of choice for evaluating the brain and orbit, and it can help to identify any structural abnormalities, inflammation, or tumors that may be causing the patient's symptoms.

Initiating high-dose corticosteroid therapy (Option A) may be considered later in the management of the patient's condition, but it is not the most appropriate next step. Obtaining a retinal biopsy (Option C) may also be considered later, but it is not necessary at this point in the patient's management. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest (Option D) is not relevant to the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, and it is not the most appropriate next step in his management.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including fever, emesis, abdominal pain, and rash, are consistent with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. EBV is a common cause of infectious mononucleosis, which is characterized by a blanching, erythematous, macular rash on the face, as seen in the patient's cheeks (Figure, A). The intermittent, erythematous, reticular rash on the patient's chest, abdomen, arms, and legs (Figure, B) is also consistent with EBV infection. Additionally, the patient's leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated liver enzymes are consistent with EBV infection. Acute appendicitis cannot be excluded radiographically, but the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are more consistent with EBV infection. Therefore, the diagnosis is most likely Epstein-Barr virus infection.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and imaging results are consistent with a periosteal osteosarcoma. The mass is located in the mandible, has areas of calcification and ossification, and is associated with teeth mobility, which are all features consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of smoking and age are risk factors for the development of osteosarcoma. The presence of ulceration and chronic inflammation on the previous biopsy also supports this diagnosis. Periosteal osteosarcoma is a type of osteosarcoma that arises in the periosteum, the connective tissue that covers the bone. It is a malignant tumor that can infiltrate and destroy adjacent bone and soft tissue.

The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and findings as well. Parosteal osteosarcoma (option A) is a type of osteosarcoma that arises in the parosteal tissue, which is the connective tissue that surrounds the bone. It is less common than periosteal osteosarcoma and typically affects younger patients. Peripheral ossifying fibroma (option B) is a benign tumor that arises in the periodontal tissue and is usually painless. It does not explain the patient's symptoms of difficulty tolerating a regular diet and mobility of teeth. Sarcomatoid carcinoma (option D) is a rare malignant tumor that arises in the oral cavity and has a poor prognosis. It can have a variety of clinical presentations, but the patient's symptoms and findings are not consistent with this diagnosis.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of intermittent left-sided throat pain and left ear pain, along with the location of the lesion in the left side of the posterolateral tongue base, suggest a possible diagnosis of a neoplasm in the tongue base. The histopathologic images show an intermediate-grade infiltrating neoplasm forming solid sheets and glandular structures, which is consistent with a diagnosis of mucoepidermoid carcinoma. The positive staining for CK7 and p63 and negative staining for CK20, p16, and S-100 support this diagnosis. Additionally, the positive stain for mucicarmine in the glandular areas also supports this diagnosis. Therefore, option B, Mucoepidermoid carcinoma, is the most likely diagnosis.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and clinical findings, such as the rapid progression of necrotic lesions on the mandibular gingiva, ecchymoses along the mandibular buccal-gingival borders, and ischemia and necrosis extending past midline to involve mucosa on the right side, are consistent with pemphigus vulgaris. Pemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune disease that affects the mucous membranes and skin, causing painful blisters and sores. The patient's history of essential thrombocythemia and acute myelogenous leukemia increases the likelihood of this diagnosis, as hematologic malignancies are known to be associated with an increased risk of developing autoimmune diseases. The negative cultures for organisms and the absence of signs of viral or bacterial infection support this diagnosis over options A and D. The patient's age and medical history also make option B less likely.

Answer: C
Explanation:
The correct answer is C, Ancient schwannoma.

The patient's symptoms of a painless, gradually increasing swelling in the right side of the neck, with no other constitutional symptoms, suggest a benign tumor. The location of the mass in the carotid space, displacing the common carotid artery and internal jugular vein, is consistent with a schwannoma. The histopathologic images (Figure, C and D) show a tumor with a characteristic Antoni A and Antoni B pattern, which is consistent with a schwannoma. Additionally, the presence of cystic areas and coarse specks of calcification within the mass, as seen on the CT scan, are also consistent with a schwannoma.

Extraskeletal chondrosarcoma (A) is a malignant tumor that arises from cartilage and can occur in the soft tissues of the neck, but it typically has a more aggressive clinical course and would be unlikely to present with a 6-year history of a gradually increasing swelling. Malignant fibrous histiocytoma (B) is a malignant soft tissue tumor that can occur in the neck, but it typically has a more aggressive clinical course and would be unlikely to have the characteristic Antoni A and Antoni B pattern seen in schwannomas. Synovial sarcoma (D) is a malignant soft tissue tumor that can occur in the neck, but it typically has a more aggressive clinical course and would be unlikely to have the characteristic calcifications and cystic areas seen in schwannomas.

Answer: C. Herpes simplex uveitis.
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of blurred vision, elevated intraocular pressure, and hypopyon (a collection of pus in the anterior chamber of the eye) are consistent with uveitis, an inflammatory condition affecting the uvea (the middle layer of the eye). The presence of small hemorrhages on the iris surface and the absence of retinal hemorrhages or optic disc swelling also support this diagnosis. Herpes simplex uveitis is a common form of uveitis caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). The patient's history of colonic adenocarcinoma and previous radiation therapy may have weakened his immune system, increasing his susceptibility to HSV infection.

Endogenous endophthalmitis (option A) is unlikely given the absence of signs of intraocular inflammation, such as vitritis or retinal edema, and the lack of neovascularization on gonioscopy. HLA-B27 uveitis (option B) is less likely given the patient's age and the absence of a history of psoriasis or other autoimmune disorders. Leukemia relapse (option D) is possible but less likely given the absence of other systemic symptoms or signs of leukemia relapse.

The patient's symptoms of mild gallstone pancreatitis, along with the abnormal intraoperative cholangiogram findings, suggest a diagnosis of gallbladder duplication with double cystic duct (C). The presence of multiple gallstones within a dilated region of the cystic duct supports this diagnosis. Choledochoduodenal fistula (A) is unlikely given the absence of symptoms such as abdominal pain, fever, and cholangitis. Biloma (B) is also unlikely as it typically presents with symptoms of biliary obstruction and jaundice, which are not mentioned in the case. Choledochal cyst and long common biliopancreatic channel (D) is a possibility, but the absence of symptoms such as abdominal pain, jaundice, and pancreatitis makes it less likely.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of flank and abdominal pain, along with the finding of asymmetric attenuation surrounding the infrarenal aorta on the CT angiogram, are consistent with an inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm (IAAA). This is a rare condition that occurs when the aortic wall becomes inflamed, leading to aneurysmal dilatation. The patient's history of weight loss and anorexia also supports this diagnosis.

The other options are less likely:

* A: Mycotic aneurysm is an aneurysm that is caused by infection, typically by bacteria or fungi. The patient's history of no previous abdominal surgery, dental cleanings, intravenous drug use, cutaneous abscesses, or recent trauma makes this diagnosis less likely.
* C: Pseudoaneurysm is a false aneurysm that occurs when there is a tear in the arterial wall, leading to bleeding into the surrounding tissue. This diagnosis is less likely given the patient's symptoms and the finding of asymmetric attenuation on the CT angiogram.
* D: Infrarenal aortitis due to diverticulitis is inflammation of the aorta due to diverticulitis, which is a condition where small pouches form in the wall of the colon. This diagnosis is less likely given the patient's lack of symptoms suggestive of diverticulitis, such as fever, nausea, and abdominal tenderness.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is B: Inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of fevers, night sweats, nausea, and fatigue, along with the growing and painful scar on her abdomen, suggest a possible underlying infection or inflammatory process. A CT scan of the chest and abdomen would be appropriate to evaluate for any abscesses, inflammatory masses, or other intra-abdominal pathology that may be causing her symptoms. Additionally, the patient's history of cancer and recent development of ulcerations and purple subcutaneous papules on the scar suggest a possible immune-related etiology, such as a pyogenic granuloma or a cutaneous lymphoma, which a CT scan could help to identify. Therefore, option C is the most appropriate next step in the patient's management.

Answer: B
Explanation: Trichomycosis axillaris is a benign infection of the hair shaft caused by a gram-positive bacterium, usually Corynebacterium tenuis. The clinical presentation of trichomycosis axillaris includes the formation of yellow or creamy concretions along the hair shaft, which correspond to the bacterial colonies. The patient's history of playing soccer and sweating abundantly, without using deodorant or other products, suggests that the bacteria have colonized the axillary hairs. The absence of itching is also consistent with trichomycosis axillaris, as it is generally not associated with symptoms. The microscopic examination of hair samples (Figure B-D) and microbiologic culture can help confirm the diagnosis. Treatment with antiseptic soap and a miconazole nitrate cream, which targets the bacterial infection, led to resolution of the lesions and normalization of axillary hairs. Therefore, based on the clinical presentation, microscopic examination, and response to treatment, the diagnosis is most likely trichomycosis axillaris (B).

Answer: C 
Explanation: The clinical presentation of numerous small, smooth, brown papules on the trunk and legs, with a positive Darier sign, is consistent with eruptive syringoma. Eruptive syringoma is a benign condition characterized by the sudden appearance of multiple small papules or nodules on the trunk and extremities. The lesions are usually asymptomatic and may have a positive Darier sign, which is a diagnostic feature of syringoma. The patient's age and lack of family history also support this diagnosis. Urticaria pigmentosa (B) is a possibility, but the absence of any history of vesiculation and the presence of a positive Darier sign argue against this diagnosis. Eruptive vellus hair cysts (A) are unlikely given the absence of any history of vesiculation and the presence of a positive Darier sign. Lichen nitidus (D) is a rare condition that typically presents with small, shiny, flat papules on the trunk and extremities, and is not associated with a positive Darier sign.

Answer: C
Explanation: Chrysiasis is a condition where there is a localized or generalized increase in skin pigmentation due to the deposition of silver or gold particles in the skin. The patient's history of oral gold salts for rheumatoid arthritis 15 years ago suggests that she may have had chronic exposure to gold, which could have led to the deposition of gold particles in her skin. The immediate onset of pigmentation after laser treatment and the similarity in appearance to argyria (a condition caused by silver deposition) support this diagnosis. The fact that a rechallenge test with the same laser on the right forearm resulted in a similar pigmented lesion further supports the diagnosis of chrysiasis. Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation (option A) is a possible complication of laser treatment, but it typically occurs weeks to months after treatment and is not associated with a history of gold exposure. Argyria (option B) is a condition caused by silver deposition and can result in a similar appearance, but it is not associated with gold exposure. Tattoo pigmentation (option D) is not a likely diagnosis in this case, as the patient did not have any tattoos.

Answer: C. Intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor therapy
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with macular edema, which is a common complication of meningioma. The presence of subretinal fluid and thickening in the macular region on optical coherence tomography supports this diagnosis. Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy is a common treatment for macular edema, as it helps to reduce the amount of fluid in the retina and improve vision. Observation (A) may not be sufficient to address the patient's symptoms and may allow the edema to worsen, potentially leading to permanent vision loss. Macular laser photocoagulation (B) may also be considered, but it is less likely to be effective in this case given the presence of subretinal fluid. Intravitreal corticosteroid therapy (D) may also be considered, but it may have more side effects than anti-VEGF therapy and may not be as effective in reducing fluid in the retina.

The fact that the patient has been using topical corticosteroids and antibiotics without improvement suggests that the condition may be resistant to these treatments. Cyclosporine is an immunosuppressive medication that can be effective in treating chronic conjunctivitis that is resistant to other treatments. Oral acyclovir (option A) may be effective in treating herpetic keratitis, but there is no indication of a viral etiology in this case. Oral cimetidine (option C) is not commonly used to treat conjunctivitis.

Answer: D
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of diplopia, ataxia, and weight loss, along with the physical examination findings of a fourth cranial nerve palsy, left ptosis, and flattening of the right nasolabial fold, suggest a possible diagnosis of a paraneoplastic syndrome. The patient's history of heavy smoking and the presence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy, subcentimeter pulmonary nodules, and calcified pleural plaques on chest CT scan also support this possibility. A whole-body FDG-PET/CT scan and paraneoplastic antibody evaluation would be appropriate next steps to help confirm the diagnosis and identify the underlying cancer. Obtaining evoked potentials (option A) or electromyography (option B) may also be useful in evaluating the neurological symptoms, but they are not as urgent or relevant as the cancer workup. Checking thiamine levels and starting oral supplementation (option C) may be appropriate if the patient's symptoms are thought to be related to a nutritional deficiency, but there is no clear indication for this in the given case.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as well-demarcated ulcers with scalloped borders on either side of the midline, superior to the anal verge, and bright red matted telangiectasias extending from the anus to the ulcers, are consistent with candidal dermatitis. The patient's history of being treated with antibiotics and topical medications, as well as the absence of systemic symptoms, also support this diagnosis. Acrodermatitis enteropathica (A) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the skin and gastrointestinal system, and is not associated with candidal infections. Ulcerated segmental infantile hemangioma (B) is a rare vascular tumor that typically appears as a solitary ulcerated lesion, and is not associated with candidal infections. Jacquet erosive diaper dermatitis (D) is a severe form of diaper dermatitis that can cause ulceration, but it is typically associated with a history of prolonged exposure to urine and stool, and does not present with the characteristic red matted telangiectasias seen in this patient.

Answer: C
Explanation: The correct answer is C, Juvenile xanthogranuloma. The clinical presentation of a superficial postauricular mass that increased in size over a short period, with no systemic symptoms, and the histopathological findings of lobules of lipidized histiocytic cells with eosinophils in a background of collagen, are consistent with the diagnosis of juvenile xanthogranuloma. Additionally, the negative staining for S-100 and CD1a supports this diagnosis. Juvenile xanthogranuloma is a rare benign tumor that typically affects children and young adults, and it is characterized by the presence of foamy histiocytic cells. Pyogenic granuloma (B) is a possible diagnosis, but it typically presents with a more rapid growth rate and a more inflammatory response. Spitz nevus (A) is a benign melanocytic tumor that can occur in children, but it typically has a different histopathological appearance, with a characteristic "spitzoid" pattern.

The fact that the patient is edentulous also supports this diagnosis, as ameloblastic carcinoma is more common in people who have lost their teeth. The CT images also show characteristics that are consistent with ameloblastic carcinoma, such as a multilocular, low-attenuation lesion with severe erosion of the facial and lingual cortices, and a scalloping pattern. Additionally, the soft-tissue CT images indicate a cystic and solid nature of the mass, which is also consistent with ameloblastic carcinoma. Therefore, based on the patient's symptoms and the CT images, the most likely diagnosis is ameloblastic carcinoma.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of persistent globus pharyngis for 2 decades, along with the physical examination findings of yellowish floppy granular proliferation on the arytenoids and aryepiglottic folds, and the pathological findings of eosinophilic amorphous material underlying the epithelium, are consistent with localized laryngeal amyloidosis. The positive staining for thioflavin T and the characteristic apple-green birefringence under polarized light after binding to Congo red dye further support this diagnosis. The absence of systemic involvement and/or plasma cell dyscrasia also supports this diagnosis.

Lipoma (option A) is a benign tumor composed of fat cells, and would not explain the patient's symptoms or pathological findings.

Sarcoidosis (option B) is a systemic inflammatory disease that can affect various organs, including the larynx. However, the patient's lack of symptoms and signs of systemic involvement, as well as the absence of plasma cell dyscrasia, make this diagnosis less likely.

Answer: C 
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and the results of the imaging studies suggest a diagnosis of a dermoid cyst. The patient had a 1-year history of submental swelling, which is consistent with the slow-growing nature of dermoid cysts. The lesion was well-circumscribed, avascular, homogeneous, and isoechoic on ultrasonography, which are all characteristic features of a dermoid cyst. Additionally, the lesion demonstrated T2 hyperintensity and T1 hypointensity on MRI, which are consistent with the signal intensity of a dermoid cyst. The patient's history of papillary thyroid cancer and total thyroidectomy may also increase the likelihood of a dermoid cyst. Finally, the transcervical excision of the mass and the fact that it was encapsulated and positioned above the mylohyoid muscle, extending into the FOM between bilateral genioglossus muscles, supports the diagnosis of a dermoid cyst.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's presentation of grouped, brown, flat-topped papules on his distal plantar left foot, along with the patient's history of transformed marginal zone lymphoma and recent chemotherapy treatment, suggests a diagnosis of cutaneous lymphoma. The patient's complaint of a pruritic rash on his left thigh and the presence of erythematous papules and plaques on his posterolateral thigh also support this diagnosis. The patient's history of plantar warts and belief that the current lesions are identical in appearance may indicate a misdiagnosis or a failure to recognize the true nature of the current lesions. Shingles, herpes zoster, may cause a similar appearance, but the patient's history and physical examination do not support this diagnosis. Toxic erythema of chemotherapy may cause a rash, but it would not explain the patient's painful plantar lesions. The patient's pancytopenia and elevated lactate dehydrogenase level are consistent with the patient's history of transformed marginal zone lymphoma and recent chemotherapy treatment.

Answer: C 
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive swelling and pain on the right side of her neck, along with the presence of a round, partially enhancing, cystic mass near the tail of the parotid gland on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are consistent with a diagnosis of cavernous hemangioma. This type of vascular malformation is typically slow-growing and may not cause symptoms until it reaches a certain size or becomes inflamed. The patient's history of sleep apnea and remote transient ischemic attack with left-sided weakness may also be relevant to the patient's overall health and potential treatment plan, but they are not directly related to the likely diagnosis of cavernous hemangioma. Pseudoaneurysm (option B) is a possible diagnosis for a cystic mass near an artery, but it is less likely given the patient's symptoms and MRI findings. Schwannoma (option A) is a type of benign nerve sheath tumor that can occur in the head and neck, but it is not typically associated with cystic masses or vascular malformations.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of fatigue and polyarthralgias, along with a positive ANA test result, suggest the possibility of an autoimmune disorder. While the patient does not currently meet the criteria for a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the positive ANA test result and absence of other symptoms suggest that she may be at risk of developing SLE in the future. Therefore, option C, "The patient will develop SLE in the future," is the most appropriate answer.

Option A, "The patient has rheumatoid arthritis," is incorrect because the patient does not have joint swelling or morning stiffness, which are characteristic symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Additionally, the positive ANA test result is not specific to rheumatoid arthritis.

Option B, "The patient has systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)," is also incorrect because the patient does not currently meet the criteria for a diagnosis of SLE. While the positive ANA test result is consistent with SLE, the patient's lack of other symptoms, such as malar rash, photosensitivity, and renal involvement, makes a diagnosis of SLE less likely.

Option D, "The positive ANA test result is nonspecific and may be related to autoimmune thyroid disease," is incorrect because while it is true that a positive ANA test result can be nonspecific and may be related to autoimmune thyroid disease, the patient's symptoms and lack of other autoimmune disease symptoms make it less likely that the positive ANA test result is related to autoimmune thyroid disease.

Answer: B
Explanation: A bone marrow biopsy should be performed to assess the bone marrow morphology and to determine if there is any evidence of leukemia or other hematological disorders. The patient's symptoms of fatigue, elevated white blood cell count, and splenomegaly, along with the abnormal blood cell counts, suggest the possibility of a hematological malignancy. A bone marrow biopsy would help to confirm or rule out this diagnosis and guide further management.

Heterophile antibody test (Option A) may be useful in diagnosing certain types of leukemia, but it is not the most appropriate test in this case given the patient's symptoms and laboratory results.

Cytarabine and daunorubicin chemotherapy (Option C) may be appropriate for treating certain types of leukemia, but it should not be started without first confirming the diagnosis and assessing the patient's suitability for chemotherapy.

Leukapheresis (Option D) is a procedure that removes white blood cells from the blood, but it is not typically used as a diagnostic test. It may be considered as a treatment option for certain types of leukemia, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with Sporotrichosis. The presence of scaly erythematous papules on both forearms, pruritus, and no improvement with chlorhexidine wash or hydrocortisone cream suggest a fungal infection. The patient's history of chronic kidney disease and use of amiodarone, which can cause hyperthyroidism, increase the likelihood of Sporotrichosis. The punch biopsy specimen shows pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, spongiosis with vesiculation, intraepidermal neutrophilic microabscesses, focal subepidermal bulla formation, and dermal infiltrate of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and histiocytes, which are consistent with Sporotrichosis. The patient's serum iodine level of 42,305 ng/mL is also consistent with Sporotrichosis, as it is a known effect of the fungus on the thyroid gland.

Therefore, option C (Sporotrichosis) is the correct answer.

Option A (Sweet syndrome) is incorrect because it is a condition characterized by the rapid development of painful, edematous, and erythematous plaques on the skin, usually in response to an upper respiratory tract infection. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not support this diagnosis.

Option B (Iododerma) is incorrect because it is a rare condition characterized by the accumulation of iodine in the skin, leading to the formation of papules or nodules. The patient's history and laboratory results do not support this diagnosis.

Option D (Pemphigus vegetans) is incorrect because it is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by the formation of blisters and sores on the skin and mucous membranes. The patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not support this diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation:
The patient's history of exposure to fish and soil, combined with the presence of a painful ulcerated plaque and tender nodules, suggests a diagnosis of Mycobacterium marinum skin infection. M. marinum is a slow-growing, acid-fast bacterium that is commonly found in aquatic environments and can cause skin infections in individuals who have contact with contaminated water or soil. The patient's recent activities, such as cleaning her fish tank and gardening, increase her risk of exposure to M. marinum. The dense neutrophilic infiltrate and tissue necrosis observed on the skin biopsy also support this diagnosis.

The other options are less likely given the patient's history and clinical presentation. Nocardia brasiliensis is a soil-dwelling bacterium that can cause skin infections, but it is less commonly associated with aquatic environments. Staphylococcus aureus can cause a wide range of skin infections, but the presence of tender nodules and the patient's history of exposure to fish and soil make M. marinum a more likely diagnosis. Sporotrichosis schenckii is a fungal infection that can cause ulcerated skin lesions, but it is typically associated with exposure to rose thorns or other plant material, rather than aquatic environments.

Answer: B
Explanation: Axillary acne agminata is a rare condition characterized by the development of multiple inflammatory papules in the axillae. The patient's history of long-standing use of an aluminum-containing antiperspirant spray and the absence of facial lesions support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's lack of improvement with various medications, including antifungals and corticosteroids, suggests that the condition is not caused by a fungal or bacterial infection. The presence of focal areas of scarring on physical examination also supports this diagnosis.

Sarcoidosis (A) is a systemic inflammatory disease that can cause skin lesions, but it is unlikely in this case because the patient does not have any other symptoms or signs of sarcoidosis, such as respiratory or ocular involvement.

Miliary tuberculosis (C) is a rare form of tuberculosis that can cause skin lesions, but it is unlikely in this case because the patient does not have any other symptoms or signs of tuberculosis, such as cough or weight loss.

Talc granuloma (D) is a rare condition caused by the injection of talc into the skin, but it is unlikely in this case because there is no history of talc exposure and the patient's lesions are not consistent with this diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation:
The correct answer is C: Excise the lesion.

The patient's symptoms, such as a growing papule on the lower eyelid that is encroaching on the visual axis and causing irritation and bleeding, suggest that the lesion is not a benign hemangioma as initially diagnosed. The ulceration and bleeding also indicate that the lesion may be more aggressive and potentially malignant.

Given the patient's young age and the location of the lesion, it is important to take a more aggressive approach and excise the lesion to ensure complete removal and minimize the risk of recurrence or spread. Observation (option A) may not be sufficient given the changing nature of the lesion, and propranolol hydrochloride (option B) is not indicated for this type of lesion. Curettage (option D) may also not be sufficient to remove the entire lesion, and may not provide adequate tissue for histopathological analysis.

Therefore, the best course of action would be to excise the lesion, which would allow for complete removal and histopathological analysis to determine the nature of the lesion and guide further management if necessary.

Answer: C: Perform fluorescein angiography.
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of acute-onset bilateral decreased vision and metamorphopsia, along with the physical examination findings of fine inferior keratic precipitates, anterior chamber cells, and numerous confluent creamy yellow lesions in the peripheral retina, are consistent with a diagnosis of uveitis. Fluorescein angiography is a diagnostic test that can help to confirm the diagnosis of uveitis and assess the extent of the inflammation in the retina and choroid. It is the most appropriate next step in the evaluation of this patient.

B-scan ultrasonography (option A) may be useful in evaluating the presence of any posterior segment abnormalities, such as retinal detachment or choroidal effusion, but it is not the most appropriate test to diagnose uveitis.

Electroretinography (option B) is a test that measures the electrical activity of the retina and can be used to assess retinal function. However, it is not the most appropriate test to diagnose uveitis, as it does not provide information about the inflammatory status of the retina and choroid.

Magnetic resonance angiography (option D) is a test that can be used to evaluate the blood vessels in the body, but it is not the most appropriate test to diagnose uveitis, as it does not provide information about the inflammatory status of the retina and choroid.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's presentation of a unilateral parotid mass, recurrent otitis media, and macrocephaly, along with the physical examination findings of a blue patch on the left periauricular scalp and scattered tan patches on the trunk and extremities, are consistent with the diagnosis of plexiform neurofibroma. This is a type of benign tumor that arises from the nerve sheath and can cause compression or displacement of surrounding structures. The patient's history of frequent ear tugging and sleeping difficulties also supports this diagnosis, as plexiform neurofibromas can cause neurological symptoms such as pain and discomfort. The patient's macrocephaly and large size are also consistent with this diagnosis, as plexiform neurofibromas can cause growth acceleration.

The other options are less likely diagnoses for this patient's symptoms. Acute parotitis or parotid abscess (option A) would not explain the patient's long-standing facial mass, and venous malformation (option B) would not explain the patient's neurological symptoms or macrocephaly. Infantile hemangioma (option D) is a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's age and the presence of a blue patch on the scalp, which is more consistent with a plexiform neurofibroma.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of a nontender mass in the left parotid region, occasional blepharospasm and paresthesia in the ipsilateral eye and cheek, and unintended weight loss, along with the T2-weighted MRI showing a poorly marginated mass abutting the left superficial parotid with involvement of the masseter, are consistent with a diagnosis of undifferentiated carcinoma of the parotid gland. The patient's age and Asian heritage also increase the likelihood of this diagnosis. The positive immunohistochemical analysis for cytokeratin AE1/3 and the positive in situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus-encoded small RNAs (EBERs) support this diagnosis. Lymphoepithelial carcinoma of the parotid gland (option A) is a rare type of cancer that typically affects older patients and has a more aggressive clinical course. Lymphoma (option C) is a possibility, but the patient's symptoms and imaging findings do not strongly suggest this diagnosis. Metastatic squamous carcinoma to the parotid gland (option D) is unlikely given the patient's age and the absence of a primary squamous cell carcinoma.

Answer: C. Epidermoid cyst.
Explanation: An Epidermoid cyst is a benign growth that originates from the epidermis and is filled with keratin, which can appear as purple to blue crystals. The cystic structure and the presence of granulomatous reaction at the periphery, with occasional foreign-body giant cells, are also consistent with an Epidermoid cyst. Additionally, the location of the lesion in the dermis and its superficial nature are also consistent with an Epidermoid cyst.

Schwannoma (A) is a benign tumor that originates from the supporting cells of the nervous system, and it is not typically associated with a cystic structure or granulomatous reaction. Hamartoma (B) is a benign growth that consists of a mixture of mature cells and tissues, but it does not have the characteristic cystic structure and purple to blue crystals of an Epidermoid cyst. Calcinosis cutis (D) is a condition where there is deposition of calcium salts in the skin, which can cause firm, non-tender nodules or plaques, but it does not have the cystic structure and granulomatous reaction seen in this case.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as a soft, mobile, and nontender mass in the left preauricular region, and the imaging findings, including a well-defined capsule arising from within the superficial left parotid gland and heterogeneous soft-tissue enhancement on T1 post-contrast, are consistent with a diagnosis of sialolipoma. Sialolipoma is a rare benign tumor that originates from the salivary glands, typically the parotid gland. It is characterized by a slow growth rate and a well-defined capsule. The T1-weighted and T2-weighted images show a mass with fat signal intensity, which is consistent with the lipomatous nature of sialolipoma. The uniform suppression of the mass on the STIR sequence also supports this diagnosis. Therefore, option C, sialolipoma, is the most likely diagnosis. Options A, parotitis, and D, hemangioma, are less likely diagnoses as they do not match the patient's symptoms and imaging findings as closely. Option B, lipoma, is also less likely as it is a benign tumor of adipose tissue that is not typically found in the parotid gland.

Answer: C
Explanation: Eagle syndrome is a rare condition characterized by elongation of the styloid process, which can cause symptoms such as facial pain, swelling, and dysphagia. The patient's history of blunt trauma to the left maxilla region 10 years prior to presentation increases the likelihood of Eagle syndrome. The absence of hoarseness, weight loss, fever, night sweats, parotid mass, or involuntary facial nerve spasms also supports this diagnosis. The ossified mass seen on CT scan in the left parapharyngeal space is consistent with an elongated styloid process.

Option A, hyoid bursitis, is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and history. Although hyoid bursitis can cause neck pain and swelling, it is not typically associated with facial pain, dysphagia, or a mass in the parapharyngeal space.

Option B, temporomandibular joint dysfunction, can cause facial pain and swelling, but it is not typically associated with dysphagia or a mass in the parapharyngeal space.

Option D, metastatic thyroid cancer, is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and history. Although thyroid cancer can cause neck masses, it is not typically associated with facial pain, swelling, or dysphagia. The absence of hoarseness, weight loss, fever, night sweats, and parotid mass also makes this diagnosis less likely.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion, along with the physical examination findings of flattening of the interventricular septum and multiple pulmonary nodules, suggest a diagnosis of locally advanced lung cancer. The patient's history of smoking and age also increase her risk for lung cancer. Additionally, the computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest shows a large filling defect within the main pulmonary artery, which could be a metastasis from a primary lung tumor. The patient's history of venous thromboembolic disease and recent use of anticoagulation therapy may also increase her risk of developing lung cancer.

The other options are less likely given the patient's symptoms and medical history. Venous thromboembolic disease (option A) is a possible diagnosis, but the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings suggest a more severe condition. Pulmonary artery sarcoma (option B) is a rare condition that typically presents with symptoms of pulmonary embolism, and the patient's history of venous thromboembolic disease and recent use of anticoagulation therapy make it less likely. Pulmonary tumor embolism (option D) is also a rare condition that typically presents with symptoms of pulmonary embolism, and the patient's history of venous thromboembolic disease and recent use of anticoagulation therapy make it less likely.

Answer: C
Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of diarrhea and weight loss, along with the presence of a mass in the ampulla of Vater and the head of the pancreas, suggest a diagnosis of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). IPMNs are tumors that arise in the pancreatic duct and can cause obstructive symptoms, such as diarrhea and weight loss, due to their growth and compression of the duct. The patient's history of hypercholesterolemia and type 2 diabetes mellitus may also be relevant to the patient's overall health and potential treatment plan, but they are not directly related to the likely diagnosis of IPMN.

The other options are less likely based on the patient's symptoms and test results. Mucinous cystic neoplasms are typically benign and do not typically cause symptoms, so option A is less likely. Primary duodenal carcinoid tumors are rare and typically present with symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, which are not present in this case, making option B less likely. Serous cystadenomas are typically benign and do not typically cause symptoms, so option D is also less likely.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of arm ischemia and posterior stroke, along with the pulsatile mass in the right upper chest wall, are consistent with an innominate artery pseudoaneurysm. This is supported by the findings on the selective angiogram of the innominate artery, which shows a pseudoaneurysm. The patient's history of radiation and surgery in the neck, including a pectoralis major flap, increases the risk of developing a pseudoaneurysm. The absence of a pulse in the right-sided radial and brachial arteries also suggests that the pseudoaneurysm is affecting blood flow to the arm. Carotid stump syndrome (option A) is a possible complication of carotid artery ligation, but it typically presents with symptoms of cerebral ischemia rather than arm ischemia. Subclavian pseudoaneurysm (option B) is another possible complication of radiation and surgery in the neck, but it would not explain the patient's symptoms of arm ischemia or the pulsatile mass in the chest wall. Kommerell diverticulum (option D) is a rare condition that can cause symptoms similar to those of a pseudoaneurysm, but it is unlikely in this case given the patient's history and the findings on imaging.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's presentation of shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain, and elevated heart rate, along with the absence of hemoptysis, suggests a high likelihood of pulmonary embolism (PE). The attending physician's presumptive diagnosis of PE is supported by the patient's history of risk factors, such as dyslipidemia, obesity, and past tobacco use. The patient's pretest clinical probability of PE according to the 2-level Wells score is also consistent with this diagnosis. Therefore, the next step would be to obtain a lung ventilation-perfusion (V̇/Q̇) scan or pulmonary angiogram to confirm the diagnosis of PE. This is the most appropriate answer among the given options.

Option A, ruling out PE and performing a workup for alternative diagnoses, may be appropriate if the patient's symptoms and history did not suggest a high likelihood of PE. However, given the patient's presentation and risk factors, it is more appropriate to pursue a diagnosis of PE first.

Option B, obtaining a bilateral lower limb veins compression ultrasonography, may be necessary if the patient had a history of deep vein thrombosis or other venous thromboembolic events. However, it is not the most appropriate step in this case, as the patient's symptoms and history suggest a more urgent need to rule out PE.

Option D, testing for D-dimer, may be useful in ruling out PE, but it is not the most appropriate step in this case, as the patient's pretest clinical probability of PE is already high, and a negative D-dimer result would not necessarily exclude the diagnosis of PE.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including erythematous papules and vesicles on the palms, soles, and oropharynx, are consistent with hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD). The patient's recent move to Texas and lack of exposure to sexually transmitted infections also support this diagnosis, as HFMD is more common in the southern United States and is not typically associated with STIs. Additionally, the patient's myalgias and fatigue are consistent with HFMD. The elevated coxsackievirus titer also supports this diagnosis, as HFMD is caused by the coxsackievirus. The absence of lymphadenopathy and the presence of eroded vesicles on the palate are also consistent with HFMD. While Rocky Mountain spotted fever and secondary syphilis can cause similar skin lesions, they are less likely given the patient's history and lack of exposure to ticks (in the case of Rocky Mountain spotted fever) or genital lesions (in the case of secondary syphilis). Primary human immunodeficiency virus infection can also cause skin lesions, but the patient's lack of exposure to HIV and the presence of coxsackievirus antibodies make HFMD a more likely diagnosis.

The presence of numerous nonseptate, thick-walled fungal hyphae in the dermis also supports this diagnosis. Pyoderma gangrenosum (option A) is a possibility, but the lack of a history of poor wound healing or painful skin ulcers and the presence of fungal hyphae in the dermis argue against this diagnosis. Squamous cell carcinoma (option B) is unlikely given the patient's history of allogenic bone marrow transplant and the absence of any skin lesions suggestive of this diagnosis. Cutaneous mucormycosis (option D) is also unlikely, as it typically presents with more rapid growth and a more aggressive course, and the patient's symptoms and histopathological findings do not support this diagnosis.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of painful erythema and edema of the ears, along with the histopathological findings of thrombi within engorged blood vessels, are consistent with cold agglutinin disease. The patient's history of worsening symptoms with exposure to cold and damp environment while on his boat, and the relief provided by a heating pad, also support this diagnosis. Cold agglutinin disease is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the production of cold-reacting antibodies that cause vascular damage and thrombosis in response to cold exposure. The presence of thrombi within vessels on biopsy specimens, as seen in Figure B, is a hallmark of the disease. The negative result for significant inflammation of blood vessel walls on hematoxylin-eosin staining also supports this diagnosis, as cold agglutinin disease typically does not show significant inflammation. The patient's age and the duration of symptoms also fit with the typical demographic and clinical presentation of cold agglutinin disease. Therefore, option C, Cold agglutinin disease, is the correct answer.

Answer: C
Explanation: The clinical appearance of the eyelid nodules, along with the patient's history of recurrent parotitis, vocal cord swelling, and facial, trunk, and perineal vesicular eruptions, suggests a diagnosis of epidermolysis bullosa (EB). EB is a group of rare genetic disorders characterized by fragile skin and mucous membranes that blister and tear easily in response to minimal trauma. The nodules on the eyelids are likely a manifestation of this condition. Performing a biopsy of the eyelid nodules (option C) would be the next step in confirming the diagnosis. Option A, administering hyperfocal cryotherapy, is not appropriate for this condition, as it is typically used to treat benign skin lesions. Option B, starting D-penicillamine therapy, is also not appropriate, as this medication is used to treat Wilson's disease, which is not related to EB.

The absence of other neurological symptoms such as loss of consciousness, seizures, loss of vision or hearing, facial deviation, trouble swallowing, or weakness of the extremities also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of migraine on the maternal side of the family suggests a possible genetic predisposition to painful ophthalmoplegic neuropathy. The MRI findings of thickening of the cisternal part of the right third cranial nerve in the perimesencephalic cistern also support this diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The correct diagnosis is C, Melanin-pigmented oncocytic metaplasia of the nasopharynx. This diagnosis is supported by the following features:

1. Clinical presentation: The patient presented with a dark pigmented spot in the nasopharynx, which is a common symptom of melanin-pigmented oncocytic metaplasia.
2. Endoscopic evaluation: The lesion appeared as a black nevus-like lesion over the left torus tubarius, which is consistent with melanin-pigmented oncocytic metaplasia.
3. Histopathological findings: The surgical specimen showed small mixed serous and mucinous glands, normal respiratory epithelia with marked oncocytic cell changes, and abundant eosinophilic granular cytoplasm arranged in a tubular and microcystic pattern. These features are consistent with melanin-pigmented oncocytic metaplasia.
4. Immunohistochemical staining: The brown pigment was positive for Fontana Masson stain, which is consistent with melanin-pigmented oncocytic metaplasia.
5. Low proliferative index: Ki-67 staining revealed a low proliferative index in the lesion, which is consistent with melanin-pigmented oncocytic metaplasia.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

Answer: C. Myositis ossificans traumatica
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of severe trismus and the inability of the oral surgeon to reach the affected area during the previous surgery suggest that there is a bony or cartilaginous obstruction in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) that is preventing proper movement of the mandible. Myositis ossificans traumatica is a condition where there is abnormal bone growth in muscles, tendons, or ligaments, often as a result of trauma. The fact that the patient had a dental abscess and underwent surgery suggests that there may have been some trauma to the TMJ, leading to the development of myositis ossificans traumatica.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and imaging findings are consistent with sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC). SNUC is a rare and aggressive type of cancer that arises in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. It often presents with symptoms similar to those of chronic rhinosinusitis, such as nasal drainage, headaches, and facial swelling. The patient's history of previous nasal polyps and long-standing inflammation increases the likelihood of a sinonasal malignancy. The atypical, fibrotic appearance of the nasal polyps on deeper dissection and the bony remodeling seen on CT imaging are also consistent with SNUC. The patient's age and lack of acute worsening of symptoms in the previous months make allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS) and chronic invasive fungal sinusitis (CIFS) less likely. Chronic rhinosinusitis with polyposis (CRSwNP) is a possible diagnosis, but the patient's history and imaging findings suggest a more aggressive disease process.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's history of radiation therapy to the head and neck region, as well as the location and characteristics of the tumor, suggest that the most likely diagnosis is radiation-induced liposarcoma. The patient's age and the time elapsed since the radiation therapy also support this diagnosis, as radiation-induced sarcomas typically occur several years after exposure. The fact that the tumor is well-defined and encapsulated, with a homogeneous, whitish, rubbery, and glistening content, and the sparse cellularity and lack of cellular atypia, are also consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the tumor's immunoreactivity for S-100 and focal positivity for CD34 support the diagnosis of a radiation-induced sarcoma.

Answer: C. Laryngeal tuberculosis.
Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of progressive worsening of sore throat, fever, chills, productive cough, globus sensation, dysphagia, and muffled voice, along with the physical examination findings of mildly tender right cervical lymphadenopathy and diffuse swelling of the supraglottic structures, particularly the epiglottis and left aryepiglottic fold, are consistent with laryngeal tuberculosis. The pale appearance of the mucosa and areas of patchy enhancement on the neck CT scan also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of sarcoidosis, which can increase the risk of developing tuberculosis, further supports this diagnosis.

The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and examination findings or medical history. Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (option A) would not explain the patient's symptoms of sore throat, fever, chills, productive cough, globus sensation, dysphagia, and muffled voice, nor would it explain the physical examination findings of diffuse swelling of the supraglottic structures. Angioedema (option B) can cause swelling of the supraglottic structures, but it would not explain the patient's history of sarcoidosis or the pale appearance of the mucosa on the laryngoscopy. Laryngeal sarcoidosis (option D) is a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's history of sarcoidosis and the presence of tuberculosis in the larynx.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of a red and swollen eyelid, along with the presence of cervical lymphadenopathy, suggest that there may be an orbital or ocular infection. The patient's history of breast cancer and treatment with tamoxifen also raise the possibility of a metastasis to the eye. An ophthalmologic examination and imaging with orbital computed tomography (CT) would be necessary to determine the cause of the patient's symptoms and to rule out any serious complications. Therefore, option B, "Refer for ophthalmologic examination and orbital computed tomography," is the most appropriate next step in management. Options A and C are not appropriate, as they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Option D is also not appropriate, as there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has metastases.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's presentation of an incidentally discovered intraperitoneal mass on CT imaging, with a diagnosis made by endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration, suggests a diagnosis of fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Fibrolamellar HCC is a rare subtype of HCC that is typically seen in young adults and has a better prognosis than other types of HCC. The location of the tumors near the liver, pancreas, and stomach, as well as the presence of free fluid in the pelvis, also support this diagnosis. The other options, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, and neuroendocrine tumor of the pancreas, can also present with intraperitoneal masses, but are less likely given the patient's age and the location of the tumors.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of intermittent abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, along with the physical examination findings of abdominal tenderness and mild distension, are consistent with a possible diagnosis of enteric duplication cyst. The imaging findings of a cystic pelvic mass containing irregularly shaped ossifications also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's age and the absence of any other symptoms such as fever or abdominal guarding also suggest enteric duplication cyst as a likely diagnosis. Pelvic teratoma (option A) is a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's age and the absence of any other symptoms. Meckel diverticulum (option B) is also a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's age and the presence of ossifications within the cyst. Carcinoid tumor (option D) is unlikely given the patient's age and the absence of any other symptoms such as flushing or diarrhea.

Answer: B
Explanation: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a common cause of recurrent oral ulcers. The patient's history of recurrent painful ulcers on different mucosal surfaces, along with the presence of a pseudomembrane and erythematous halo on the tongue, are consistent with HSV infection. Valacyclovir, an antiviral medication, is effective in treating HSV infections and reducing the frequency and severity of recurrences. Therefore, option B, prescribing valacyclovir, is the most appropriate next step in management.

Option A, obtaining a biopsy of the ulcer, may be necessary in some cases to confirm the diagnosis, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, given the patient's history and clinical presentation.

Option C, ordering a complete blood cell count with differential, may be appropriate to rule out other causes of oral ulcers, such as hematologic disorders, but it is not the most urgent step in management.

Option D, prescribing amoxicillin, is not appropriate for treating HSV infections and may not be effective in managing the patient's symptoms.

Explanation: The patient's spirometry results show a reduced forced vital capacity (FVC) and a reduced forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), indicating a restrictive abnormality. The FEV1/FVC ratio is normal, ruling out an obstructive abnormality. Pseudorestriction, which is an artificially low FVC due to poor effort or inadequate inspiration, is not present in this case because the patient's FEV1 is also reduced. Therefore, option D, "Spirometry cannot be used to evaluate for obstruction in the setting of a restrictive abnormality," is the correct answer.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of dyspnea, weight loss, tremor, diaphoresis, and palpitations, along with the physical examination findings of tachycardia, tongue and hand tremors, and brisk reflexes, suggest a possible diagnosis of hyperthyroidism. The laboratory results support this diagnosis, with an elevated free thyroxine level and a low TSH level. The patient's history of a 2-fold diffusely enlarged thyroid gland also suggests a possible thyroid disorder. The 18F-fludeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/CT scan shows increased uptake in the thymus, indicating increased metabolic activity, which is consistent with hyperthyroidism. Therefore, the best next step would be to refer the patient to surgery for removal of the thymus, which is the primary source of the hyperthyroidism. This would help to alleviate the patient's symptoms and prevent any potential complications of untreated hyperthyroidism.

Explanation: The clinical presentation and histopathological features described in the case are consistent with a diagnosis of infantile myofibromatosis. The patient presented with a firm, exophytic, and flat-topped nodule on the scalp, with superficial erosion and crusting, which is a common presentation for this condition. The histopathological image shows a biopsy specimen with a characteristic "keratin-staining" pattern, which is also consistent with infantile myofibromatosis. Additionally, the fact that the lesion regressed without treatment over a period of 8 months supports this diagnosis, as infantile myofibromatosis is known to have a benign course and often regresses spontaneously. Giant cell fibroblastoma, dermoid cyst, and keratoacanthoma are less likely diagnoses based on the clinical and histopathological features described in the case.

Mucormycosis is a fungal infection caused by Mucorales, which typically affects immunocompromised individuals. The patient's history of immunosuppressive therapy following a heart transplant and recent diagnosis of plasmablastic lymphoma put him at high risk for opportunistic infections like mucormycosis. The ulcer's appearance, with a raised erythematous border and purulent debris, is also consistent with mucormycosis. The biopsy findings, which show enlarged endothelial cells with intranuclear inclusions surrounded by a clear halo, are diagnostic of mucormycosis. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including purpuric lesions on acral sites, hypercalcemia, and acute kidney injury, are consistent with Type I cryoglobulinemia associated with multiple myeloma. The histopathological findings of multifocal intravascular fibrinoid material consisting of a mix of cryoglobulins and fibrin thrombi with relatively little vessel wall inflammation support this diagnosis. Type I cryoglobulinemia is a rare complication of multiple myeloma, and it is characterized by the presence of cryoglobulins in the blood, which can cause vasculitis and thrombosis. The other options, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, antiphospholipid syndrome, and purpura fulminans, can also cause purpuric lesions, but they do not match the patient's symptoms and laboratory results as well as Type I cryoglobulinemia.

Answer: D
Explanation: The patient presents with bilateral choroidal detachment, which is a rare complication of Waldenström macroglobulinemia. The detachment is more pronounced in the left eye, with a relatively shallow anterior chamber and 360° narrow angles. There is also evidence of vitreous hemorrhage, peripheral capillary nonperfusion, vascular reorganization, and neovascularization. Given the severity of the condition and the presence of suprachoroidal effusion in the right eye, the best course of action would be to treat the patient with combined systemic chemotherapy and pars plana vitrectomy. This approach would address both the underlying disease and the ocular complications, with the goal of improving vision and preventing further damage.

Option A, observing the patient, is not appropriate given the severity of the condition and the potential for further vision loss. Option B, performing pars plana vitrectomy without systemic chemotherapy, may not effectively address the underlying disease and may result in recurrence of the choroidal detachment. Option C, treating with systemic chemotherapy alone, may not adequately address the ocular complications and may not improve vision. Therefore, option D, treating with combined systemic chemotherapy and pars plana vitrectomy, is the best choice.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with serous retinal detachment (SRD) following enucleation. SRD is a known complication of enucleation and is caused by altered vitreoretinal traction forces. The patient's history of intermittent then constant central and peripheral blurred vision, along with the presence of cells in the anterior vitreous and a serous retinal detachment involving the macula, are all consistent with SRD. The fluorescein angiography and OCT findings also support this diagnosis, showing multifocal areas of early hyperfluorescence with late leakage and diffuse retinal vascular leakage, as well as a thickened choroid and subretinal fluid throughout the macula.

Given the patient's history and examination findings, the most appropriate next step would be photodynamic therapy (PDT). PDT is a well-established treatment for SRD, and has been shown to improve visual acuity and reduce the risk of further vision loss. The other options, systemic corticosteroid therapy, observation, and antivascular endothelial growth factor therapy (anti-VEGF), may not be effective in treating SRD and may have potential side effects. Therefore, option C, photodynamic therapy, is the best answer.

Answer: B
Explanation: A retroperitoneal cystic mass in an adolescent is more likely to be a lymphatic malformation than a retroperitoneal abscess, urinoma, or pancreatic pseudocyst. Lymphatic malformations are congenital abnormalities that result from the abnormal development of lymphatic vessels and can occur in various locations, including the retroperitoneum. They can cause mass effect on surrounding organs and may not have any symptoms until they become large enough to compress or displace adjacent structures. The patient's lack of symptoms and the absence of fever or leukocytosis suggest that an infection (abscess) is less likely. Urinoma is a rare condition in which there is accumulation of urine in a retroperitoneal cyst, usually resulting from a ureteral injury or obstruction. Pancreatic pseudocysts are fluid-filled cavities that can occur in the pancreas, often as a result of pancreatitis or trauma. They can cause abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, which are not present in this case. The patient's age and the absence of any history of trauma or pancreatitis also make pancreatic pseudocyst less likely.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive unilateral nasal congestion, facial pain, and vision change, along with the findings on CT scan of complete opacification and an invasive process centered in the right maxillary sinus, are consistent with chronic invasive fungal sinusitis. The presence of numerous fungal organisms consistent with Aspergillus species on endoscopic maxillary antrostomy and biopsy supports this diagnosis. The patient's history of multiple courses of oral antibiotics without clinically significant improvement in symptoms also suggests that the infection is unlikely to be caused by bacteria. The absence of a history of immunocompromise or foreign travel reduces the likelihood of other causes of invasive fungal infections. Therefore, option B, Chronic invasive fungal sinusitis, is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: B
Explanation: Well-differentiated liposarcoma of the larynx is the most likely diagnosis based on the clinical presentation and histopathological findings. The patient's symptoms of a foreign body sensation in the throat and choking easily, along with the fibroscopy and biopsy results, are consistent with this diagnosis. The tumor's location at the laryngeal side of the left aryepiglottic fold and covering nearby structures also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the histopathological findings of adipocytes of various sizes in a fibromyxoid background, with atypical spindle cells and scattered lipoblasts, are consistent with well-differentiated liposarcoma. The immunohistochemical findings of substantial nuclear staining for both CDK4 and MDM2 also support this diagnosis.

Hemangioma of the larynx (option A) is unlikely since it typically presents with a different clinical picture, such as stridor or respiratory distress, and the histopathological findings are not consistent with hemangioma.

Schwannoma of the larynx (option C) is also unlikely since it is a rare benign tumor that typically presents with a different clinical picture, such as hoarseness or neck mass, and the histopathological findings are not consistent with Schwannoma.

Laryngocele of the larynx (option D) is not a possible diagnosis since it is a rare congenital malformation that typically presents with a different clinical picture, such as respiratory distress or stridor, and the histopathological findings are not consistent with Laryngocele.

Answer: D: Chronic hematoma.
Explanation: The diagnosis of chronic hematoma is the most likely option based on the imaging findings described in the case. The T2 hyperintense lesion within the right pterygoid muscles, without mass effect, adjacent edema, or other invasive features, is consistent with a chronic hematoma. The presence of a small focus of signal void on the T2-weighted images, suspicious for tiny calcification, and the sequential increased enhancement on the postcontrast T1-weighted axial images, are also supportive of this diagnosis. Additionally, the increased tracer pooling within the lesion on the single-proton emission computed tomography-CT (SPECT-CT) using technetium Tc 99m–labeled red blood cells, suggests that the lesion is likely a chronic hematoma. Rhabdomyosarcoma, venous malformation, and masticator space abscess are less likely diagnoses based on the imaging findings and clinical presentation.

Answer: B. Desmoid tumor.
Explanation: A desmoid tumor is a type of benign connective tissue tumor that arises from the fibroblastic cells of the soft tissues. It is characterized by a proliferation of spindle-shaped cells with a abundant production of extracellular matrix, resulting in a firm and fibrous tumor. The clinical presentation, imaging findings, and histopathological features described in the case are consistent with a desmoid tumor. The patient's age and history of smoking and alcohol use also support this diagnosis, as desmoid tumors are more common in older adults and have been associated with tobacco use. The negative staining for S-100, CD34, and Bcl-2 and the low Ki67 index also support the diagnosis of a desmoid tumor, as these tumors are typically negative for these markers and have a low proliferative index. Pleomorphic adenoma, fibrosarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma are all malignant tumors that can arise in the head and neck region, but they have different clinical and histopathological features than the case described.

Answer: C 
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of sudden left-sided abdominal pain, tenderness on the left side, and the large size of the mass on CT scan suggest a possible adrenal tumor. Adrenal myelolipoma is a rare benign tumor of the adrenal gland, which typically presents with symptoms related to mass effect, such as abdominal pain and tenderness. The patient's laboratory results, with normal levels of metanephrines, normetanephrines, cortisol, renin, and aldosterone, also support this diagnosis, as myelolipomas do not produce excess hormones. While renal hamartoma (B) and nonfunctional paraganglioma (D) are also possibilities, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest an adrenal tumor rather than a renal or paraganglioma. Adrenal liposarcoma (A) is a rare malignant tumor that can produce excess cortisol, but the patient's laboratory results do not support this diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, early satiety, and a mass lesion in the fundus and body of the stomach, as well as the history of alcohol abuse, are consistent with a diagnosis of gastric duplication. This is a rare congenital anomaly where there is a duplicate layer of gastric mucosa, which can cause symptoms similar to those of a gastric tumor. The patient's history of hematemesis attributed to alcoholic gastritis and the absence of vomiting at this admission suggest that the patient has a pre-existing gastric condition that has led to the development of the duplication. The biopsy results of normal gastric mucosa support this diagnosis. Leiomyosarcoma (A) and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (B) are both rare tumors that can occur in the stomach, but they are not typically associated with gastric duplication.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of unilateral eyelash hypertrichosis and iris heterochromia are concerning for a possible ocular or systemic condition. Given the patient's history of glaucoma, it is important to rule out any potential causes that may be related to the glaucoma or its treatment. A slit-lamp and dilated examination by an ophthalmologist would be the most appropriate next step to evaluate the patient's eyes and determine the cause of the symptoms. Therefore, option D is the correct answer.

Option A, performing an eye and orbit computed tomography, may be unnecessary at this point and may not provide any additional information that would help in the diagnosis or management of the patient's symptoms.

Option B, ordering serologic studies, may be appropriate if the patient had a history of autoimmune disease or other systemic conditions that could be contributing to the symptoms, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case.

Answer: C. Propylthiouracil-induced hypersensitivity vasculitis.
Explanation: Propylthiouracil, a medication used to treat hyperthyroidism, can cause a rare but potentially life-threatening side effect known as hypersensitivity vasculitis. This condition is characterized by the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels, leading to inflammation and damage to the affected tissues. The patient's symptoms of painful purpura on the bilateral helices, tender to palpation, and the histopathologic findings of leukocytoclastic vasculitis and fibrin thrombi are consistent with hypersensitivity vasculitis. The patient's recent use of propylthiouracil and the absence of other potential causes of vasculitis, such as infection or autoimmune disorders, support this diagnosis.

Explanation: The correct answer is C, Leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The clinical presentation of stellate red-brown patches on the distal extremities, along with the histopathological findings of a leukocytoclastic vasculitis, are consistent with this diagnosis. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is a type of cutaneous vasculitis that is characterized by the presence of leukocytes within the vessel walls, leading to inflammation and damage to the blood vessels. The absence of induration, scale, or ulceration also supports this diagnosis, as these are not typically seen in leukocytoclastic vasculitis. In contrast, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (A) is characterized by the presence of granulomas and polyangiitis, which are not seen in this case. Microscopic polyangiitis (B) is a type of vasculitis that affects small blood vessels, but it typically presents with more widespread skin involvement and other systemic symptoms.

Explanation: The patient's history of a slowly enlarging lesion over 5 years, without any spontaneous bleeding, crusting, or itching, suggests a benign growth. The dermoscopic features of irregular pigment globules, milialike cysts, and focal arborizing vessels are consistent with a congenital nevus. The presence of terminal hairs protruding from the lesion also supports this diagnosis. While basal cell carcinoma (A) and seborrheic keratosis (D) cannot be entirely ruled out based on the clinical picture, the combination of the patient's age, lack of significant medical history, and dermoscopic features suggests a congenital nevus as the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C. Progressive supranuclear palsy.
Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of gait dysfunction, balance problems, personality changes, and judgment impairment, as well as the presence of abnormal posturing, rigidity, and retropulsion, are consistent with a diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). The patient's age of onset, 55, is also consistent with the typical age range for PSP onset, which is between 50 and 60 years old. Additionally, the patient's Mini-Mental State Examination score of 28 out of 30 suggests that cognitive decline is not the primary symptom, which is also consistent with PSP.

The patient's cranial nerve examination findings, including decreased upgaze and mild facial masking, are also consistent with PSP. The presence of frontotemporoparietal hypometabolism on positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of the brain, which was neither typical nor atypical of Alzheimer disease, supports the diagnosis of PSP.

The other options, Alzheimer disease, frontal variant (A), frontotemporal dementia (B), and corticobasal degeneration (D), do not fit the patient's symptoms and examination findings as well as PSP. Alzheimer disease typically presents with cognitive decline as the primary symptom, which is not the case with this patient. Frontotemporal dementia typically presents with changes in personality and behavior, but the patient's symptoms of gait dysfunction, balance problems, and abnormal posturing are not typical of this condition. Corticobasal degeneration typically presents with rigidity, bradykinesia, and apraxia, but the patient's symptoms of gait dysfunction and balance problems are not typical of this condition.

Explanation: The patient has been taking chloroquine for 7 years, and the cumulative dose is 332 g. The patient has a history of nephropathy, and the current symptoms of bilateral, painless, progressive visual diminution for 2 years, along with the physical examination findings of bilateral posterior subcapsular cataracts, hypopigmented zones in the parafoveal macula, and red-green deficiencies in both eyes, are all consistent with chloroquine retinopathy. Discontinuing treatment with chloroquine is the appropriate next step in management.

Option B, reassure and observe, is not appropriate as the patient has already developed retinopathy, and close monitoring is necessary to prevent further progression.

Option C, treat with intravitreous corticosteroids, may be considered in some cases of chloroquine retinopathy, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as the patient has not yet shown signs of active inflammation or edema.

Option D, examine family members for macular dystrophy, is not relevant to the patient's current condition and management.

Answer: C
Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, such as follicular rash on the knees and elbows, and hyperkeratosis on the palms, are consistent with Circumscribed Juvenile Pityriasis Rubra Pilaris (CJPRP). This is a rare genetic disorder that affects the skin, causing redness, scaling, and thickening of the skin. The fact that the patient had no other medical problems, was not taking any medications, and had no pets, supports the diagnosis of CJPRP. Additionally, the patient's age and the absence of any recent travel or exposure to new substances also point towards CJPRP.

Atopic dermatitis (D) is a common skin condition characterized by dry, itchy, and inflamed skin, but it typically does not cause follicular rash or hyperkeratosis on the palms. Ichthyosis (B) is a group of skin disorders characterized by dry, scaly skin, but it does not typically cause follicular rash or hyperkeratosis on the palms. Psoriasis (A) is a chronic skin condition characterized by red, scaly patches, but it typically affects adults and is less common in children.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of nasal obstruction and epistaxis, along with the physical examination findings of a large, well-vascularized polypoid mass in the right anterior nasal cavity, are consistent with a diagnosis of nasal alveolar soft part sarcoma (NASS). The patient's age and lack of family or personal history of bleeding disorders also support this diagnosis. The histopathologic findings of a sheet-like proliferation of epithelioid and polygonal cells with positive staining for smooth muscle actin and other markers are also consistent with NASS. Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma (Option A) is a malignant tumor that can arise in the nasal cavity, but it typically affects older children and young adults and has a more aggressive clinical course. Malignant melanoma (Option C) is a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's age and the absence of pigmentation or other melanotic features. Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (Option D) is a benign tumor that can occur in the nasal cavity, but it typically has a more characteristic histopathologic appearance and is less likely to cause epistaxis.

Answer: B
Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of progressive left periorbital swelling, orbital pain, and the presence of a firm mass over the left zygoma and lateral infraorbital rim, are consistent with a diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma. This is a type of soft tissue sarcoma that arises in the skeletal muscles and can occur in various parts of the body, including the orbit. The patient's age and lack of other symptoms, such as diplopia, nasal obstruction, or weight loss, also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the imaging findings of a round, soft-tissue mass with osseous destruction and erosion into the zygoma, infratemporal fossa, inferolateral orbit, and maxillary sinus, are consistent with rhabdomyosarcoma. The patient's history of mild developmental delay and autism may also be relevant to the patient's overall care and management, but they are not directly related to the likely diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Rhabdomyosarcoma.

Explanation: Chondrodermatitis nodularis chronica helicis (CNCH) is a rare condition characterized by the development of painful nodules on the ears, particularly on the helix. The clinical and histopathological features described in the case, such as the dome-shaped nodules with central crusting, hyperkeratotic and parakeratotic scale, and eosinophilic degeneration of collagen, are consistent with CNCH. The patient's history of wearing a cap that created pressure and friction on the upper part of both ears supports this diagnosis. The absence of cervical lymphadenopathy and the normal cartilage on serial sectioning also support the diagnosis of CNCH over other possibilities such as keratoacanthoma, glomus tumor, or rheumatoid nodule.

Answer: C
Explanation:
The correct answer is C, Liposarcoma.

The clinical presentation of a slow-growing, painless mass in the right inferior facial area, with no other symptoms, and normal laboratory results, suggests a benign soft tissue tumor. The CT imaging findings of a well-defined, hyperdense mass with areas of fat attenuation, and no periosteal reaction or bone erosion, also support this diagnosis.

Liposarcoma is a type of soft tissue sarcoma that arises from fat cells. It is the most common type of soft tissue sarcoma, and typically presents as a slow-growing, painless mass, as in this case. The fact that the mass is separate from the mandible and has no fixation to adjacent structures also supports this diagnosis.

Osteolipoma (A) is a rare benign bone tumor that consists of a mixture of bone and fat. It is usually located in the long bones, and is not typically seen in the facial area. Myositis ossificans (B) is a condition where there is bony formation within muscle tissue, usually due to trauma or inflammation. It is not typically associated with a slow-growing, painless mass in the facial area. Calcified teratoma/dermoid (D) is a type of benign tumor that arises from embryonic cells and can have a variety of tissue components, including bone, fat, and skin. However, it is not typically seen in the facial area and would not explain the CT imaging findings of a well-defined, hyperdense mass with areas of fat attenuation.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive memory loss, depression, and sleep disturbance, along with the MRI findings of extensive ill-defined areas of FLAIR and T2 signal abnormalities with enhancing nodular foci in deep white matter structures, are consistent with a neoplastic process such as glioma or metastases. The involvement of the leptomeningeal region also supports this diagnosis. While multiple sclerosis (option A) and infectious causes (option C) cannot be entirely ruled out based on the MRI findings alone, the patient's clinical presentation and imaging features are more consistent with a neoplastic process. Primary central nervous system lymphoma (option D) is less likely given the absence of significant mass effect or obstructive hydrocephalus. Therefore, option B is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of episodic numbness and paresthesias in both feet, with symptom-free intervals between episodes, and the fact that the symptoms are triggered by straining with urination and terminated by lying supine, suggest a possible spinal dural arteriovenous fistula (SDAVF). This is supported by the patient's history of urinary retention, which is a common association with SDAVF. The blurry spinal cord signal alteration at the T7-T8 level with deformation of the cord posteriorly, as seen on the MRI scan with FIESTA sequences, is also consistent with SDAVF. Therefore, option C, Spinal dural arteriovenous fistula, is the most likely diagnosis.

Option A, Anterior thoracolumbar spinal cord herniation, is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and MRI findings. Option B, Malignant neoplasm of the spinal cord, is also unlikely given the patient's age and the absence of any other indicative symptoms or MRI findings. Option D, Spinal extradural arachnoid cyst, is not supported by the patient's symptoms or MRI findings.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of acute onset of right upper quadrant abdominal pain, tender abdomen, and asymmetric thickening of the gallbladder wall on ultrasound, along with the presence of a soft-tissue mass associated with the fundus of the gallbladder on CT scan, are consistent with a diagnosis of gallbladder cancer. The patient's history of recurrent abdominal pain over the past month also supports this diagnosis. While acute cholecystitis (option A) and xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis (option B) can also cause abdominal pain and thickening of the gallbladder wall, the presence of a soft-tissue mass suggests a malignancy rather than an inflammatory process. Adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder (option D) is a rare condition that typically presents with symptoms of biliary colic and is not associated with a soft-tissue mass. Therefore, option C, gallbladder cancer, is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as fever, cough, limited deep inspiration, and left-sided pleuritic chest pain, along with the positive D-dimer test result, suggest a high likelihood of pulmonary embolism (PE). The Wells score, which takes into account various clinical and laboratory factors, also supports this diagnosis. Therefore, option B, "D-dimer test result is positive. The diagnosis of PE is confirmed," is the correct answer.

Option A, "D-dimer test result is positive. Imaging test is required," is incorrect because while a positive D-dimer test does suggest the possibility of PE, it is not diagnostic on its own and further imaging studies are needed to confirm the diagnosis.

Option C, "D-dimer test result is positive but below her age-adjusted cutoff. PE is ruled out," is incorrect because the patient's age-adjusted cutoff for the D-dimer test is not provided in the case scenario, and it is not appropriate to assume that a positive D-dimer test result below a certain cutoff automatically rules out PE.

Option D, "D-dimer test result is positive due to active malignancy. PE is ruled out," is incorrect because while malignancy can cause a positive D-dimer test result, it is not a definitive cause and PE should still be considered in the differential diagnosis, especially given the patient's symptoms and positive D-dimer test result.

Answer: D
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a tibial stress syndrome (TSS), also known as shin splints. This is a common overuse injury in runners and athletes who participate in sports involving running and jumping. The patient's obesity and recent increase in physical activity, as well as the localized tenderness and pain with single-leg hop test, support this diagnosis.

Therefore, the next step in management would be to order observation and pain management with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), which is option D. This will allow the patient to rest and recover from the injury, while also managing her pain and inflammation.

Option A, obtaining laboratory work to assess for nutritional or hormonal abnormalities, may be unnecessary at this stage, as the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with TSS, and there is no indication of any underlying nutritional or hormonal disorder.

Option B, referring for immediate surgery, is not appropriate, as TSS is a non-surgical condition that can be managed conservatively with rest, physical therapy, and medication.

Option C, ordering immobilization with non–weight-bearing activity, may be considered if the patient's symptoms persist or worsen despite conservative management, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this time.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's presentation of a painful rash and swelling of his right foot, along with the presence of central vesicles, suggests a diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis. This is supported by the patient's history of bronchiectasis, which increases the risk of developing necrotizing fasciitis. The patient's eosinophilic leukocytosis and normal platelet count also support this diagnosis. Necrotizing fasciitis is a surgical emergency that requires prompt treatment, including antibiotics and surgical debridement. Therefore, the next step would be to perform a herpes simplex virus/varicella zoster virus direct fluorescent antibody test and empirically treat with valacyclovir, as this can help to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment. Obtaining blood cultures and empirically treating with intravenous vancomycin may also be appropriate, but it is not the most urgent step in this situation. Obtaining ANCA titers and starting a high-potency topical steroid may not be relevant to the patient's current condition and can be considered later.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, including the diffuse papular eruption and lack of scale or other epidermal changes, are consistent with indeterminate cell histiocytosis (ICH). ICH is a rare condition characterized by the proliferation of aberrant histiocytic cells that cannot be classified as either Langerhans cells or macrophages. The punch biopsy specimen (Figure, C) shows a dense infiltrate of small, uniform cells with minimal cytological atypia, which is consistent with ICH. The patient's symptoms of fever, weakness, and malaise, as well as the presence of splenomegaly and axillary lymphadenopathy, suggest a possible association with an underlying hematological disorder, such as adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATLL). However, the peripheral blood smear (Figure, D) does not show the characteristic "flower-like" cells seen in ATLL. Therefore, the diagnosis of ICH is the most likely explanation for the patient's symptoms and findings.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and the presence of tender erythematous nodules and plaques, particularly around the suture sites, suggest a diagnosis of tumid lupus erythematosus. Tumid lupus erythematosus is a rare form of cutaneous lupus erythematosus that is characterized by the development of tender, erythematous nodules or plaques, often on the face, neck, or extremities. The lesions are typically associated with prominent inflammation and can be induced by trauma, infection, or sun exposure. The patient's history of SLE and the presence of poorly demarcated erythematous plaques and nodules, tender to palpation, are consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's lack of a history of discoid or tumid lupus lesions and the absence of typical discoid lupus erythematosus skin findings, such as scaly, crusted, or hypopigmented patches, also support this diagnosis. Cellulitis (option A) is unlikely given the absence of signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, or warmth, and the lack of a purulent discharge. Gyrate erythema (option C) is a rare condition characterized by the development of erythematous, circular or oval, well-defined plaques on the extremities, often associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. Erythema nodosum (option D) is a common condition characterized by the development of tender, erythematous nodules, usually on the shins, associated with various inflammatory conditions, including infections, autoimmune disorders, and medications. However, the patient's history of SLE and the presence of poorly demarcated erythematous plaques and nodules, tender to palpation, are not consistent with this diagnosis.

Answer: C 
Explanation: Enucleation is the most appropriate next step in management of this patient. The patient has a large, hemorrhagic, and necrotic mass obscuring the entire globe and eyelids of the left eye, which is causing pain and affecting vision. The rapid growth of the mass and the patient's history of traumatic ruptured globe suggest that the mass is likely to be a malignant tumor. Enucleation is the surgical removal of the eye and is the best way to remove the tumor and prevent further damage to the surrounding tissues. Incisional biopsy may not be sufficient to diagnose and remove the entire tumor, and computed tomographic scan of the orbit may not provide adequate information to guide management. Exenteration, or surgical removal of the eye and surrounding tissues, may be considered in some cases, but is not the most appropriate next step in this patient's management. Testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may be appropriate in certain cases, but is not directly related to the patient's current condition and therefore is not the most appropriate next step.

Explanation: Hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) is a common viral illness that affects children, characterized by fever, mouth ulcers, and a rash with blisters on the hands and feet. One of the characteristic features of HFMD is the presence of nail changes, which can include brittle nails, cracking, and sloughing off of the nail plate. The nail changes in HFMD are usually painless and can occur on both fingernails and toenails. The patient's history of sudden onset of brittle nails with cracks followed by painless sloughing of nails, as well as the involvement of both fingernails and toenails, are consistent with HFMD. The absence of any other skin or nail conditions and the lack of a history of drug intake or recent vaccination also support this diagnosis. Therefore, option D is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of worsening, primarily left-sided, sinus obstruction and congestion with associated hyposmia, facial pressure, and headaches, along with the computed tomographic scan showing a 3.1-cm mass in the left ethmoid sinus and nasal cavity, are consistent with a diagnosis of sinonasal tumor. The biopsy specimen showing a heterogeneous tumor with small, angulated, blue cells with hyperchromatic nuclei, apoptosis, and mitosis, malignant glands lined by cuboidal cells with round nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and eosinophilic cytoplasm, and the presence of rhabdomyoblasts with abundant eosinophilic, refractile cytoplasm, are consistent with a diagnosis of small cell carcinoma. The positive staining for desmin and myogenin in the rhabdomyoblasts supports this diagnosis. Therefore, option C, small cell carcinoma, is the correct answer.

Option A, olfactory neuroblastoma, is unlikely because the patient does not have a history of sinus disease or surgery, and the computed tomographic scan does not show any evidence of a mass in the olfactory region.

Option B, sinonasal teratocarcinosarcoma, is also unlikely because the patient's symptoms and the biopsy findings do not support this diagnosis. Sinonasal teratocarcinosarcoma is a rare tumor that typically presents with nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and facial pain, and is characterized by the presence of both malignant epithelial and mesenchymal components. The biopsy specimen does not show any evidence of mesenchymal differentiation, which argues against this diagnosis.

Option D, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, is unlikely because the patient's age and the presence of rhabdomyoblasts with abundant eosinophilic, refractile cytoplasm are not consistent with this diagnosis. Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma is a rare tumor that typically affects children and young adults, and is characterized by

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of oropharyngeal discomfort, snoring, and obstructive sleep disturbance, along with the physical examination findings of a firm, nontender mass on the posterior oropharyngeal wall, are consistent with an oropharyngeal mass causing obstructive sleep apnea. The patient's history of a gradually increasing lumpy feeling on swallowing for at least 6 months, without dysphagia, dyspnea, or pain, also supports this diagnosis. The CT and MRI findings of a segmented bony lesion located at the odontoid process and the body of the C2 vertebra, with a hypointense rim in both T1- and T2-weighted MRI, are consistent with an osteochondroma, which is a benign bony outgrowth that can cause local compression and obstruction. Therefore, option C, Osteochondroma, is the most likely diagnosis. Option A, Exuberant osteophytes, is less likely as it typically refers to an excessive growth of bony outgrowths, rather than a single, localized mass. Option B, Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis, is also less likely as it is a condition characterized by diffuse bony outgrowths and inflammation, rather than a single, localized mass. Option D, Osteoid osteoma, is unlikely as it is a benign bone tumor that typically causes pain and tenderness, which the patient does not report.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of a gradually enlarging soft palate mass associated with a change in her voice, along with the physical examination findings of a firm, nontender, submucosal posterior soft palate mass, are consistent with a diagnosis of pleomorphic adenoma. This type of tumor is a benign salivary gland tumor that often affects the soft palate and can cause voice changes. The patient's age and lack of other symptoms, such as pain or difficulty swallowing, also support this diagnosis. The imaging findings of a well-circumscribed solid lesion with no evidence of infiltration of soft-tissue structures, the pterygopalatine fossa, or palatine nerve foramina, and the absence of cervical lymphadenopathy, are also consistent with a diagnosis of pleomorphic adenoma. The fact that the lesion was easily dissected from the surrounding tissue during surgery and the overlying mucosa was spared, further supports this diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's history of a chronic, non-healing rash with scaly plaques and excoriation, as well as the absence of lymphadenopathy, suggests a diagnosis of Bowen disease (also known as squamous cell carcinoma in situ). This type of cancer usually presents as a slow-growing, persistent, and often pruritic patch or plaque on sun-exposed areas. The patient's history of previous cancer diagnoses and treatment (prostate cancer and melanoma) also increases the likelihood of a skin cancer diagnosis. Additionally, the location of the lesion in the inguinal crease, which is a common area for Bowen disease, supports this diagnosis.

Fungal infection (option A) is less likely given the patient's history and the appearance of the lesion. Extramammary Paget disease (option B) typically presents with a more widespread, crusted, and oozing rash, and is more commonly found in the perianal and perineal regions. Lichen sclerosis (option D) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that can cause thickening and hardening of the skin, but it is not typically associated with a history of cancer or the appearance of a scaly plaque.

Answer: D
Explanation: Echinococcal disease is a parasitic infection caused by the larval form of Echinococcus granulosus, which can form cysts in various organs, including the spleen. The patient's history of living in Beijing, China, and her consumption of sheep meat, suggest a higher likelihood of exposure to Echinococcus granulosus. The patient's negative serologic test results for Echinococcus antibody IgG do not rule out the diagnosis, as the sensitivity of this test is not perfect. The patient's symptoms of abdominal bloating and left upper quadrant pain, as well as the presence of a large splenic cyst with rim calcifications, are consistent with Echinococcal disease. The presence of a smaller posterior cyst, also with calcified capsule, supports the diagnosis of Echinococcal disease, as this is a common feature of this condition. Therefore, option D, Echinococcal disease, is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's hyponatremia (serum sodium of 128 mEq/L) is likely due to hypopituitarism, specifically anterior hypopituitarism, which can cause hypoadrenalism (primary adrenal insufficiency). This can lead to decreased production of aldosterone and cortisol, resulting in hypotonic hyponatremia. The patient's urine output, moist mucosae, and lack of peripheral edema also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of glioma and treatment with chemotherapy and radiation may have contributed to the development of hypopituitarism. Therefore, option B (euvolemic hypotonic hyponatremia) is the most appropriate answer.

Explanation: The patient's history of long-standing mental depression and recent onset of cutaneous ulceration, along with the negative culture results, suggest that the ulcer is not infectious in nature. The patient's use of meperidine, a synthetic opioid, may have contributed to the development of fibrosis and ulceration, as it has been associated with cases of necrotizing fasciitis and cutaneous ulceration. The histopathological findings of woody induration and dense fibrosis in the skin biopsy support the diagnosis of fibrosis and ulceration caused by meperidine. Therefore, option B is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as the slowly enlarging and painful mass on his buttock, and the appearance of a nonpruritic rash on his forearms and thighs, are consistent with a diagnosis of verrucous herpes simplex virus (VHS). The physical examination findings, including the 2-cm macerated pedunculated growth on the left buttock within the intergluteal cleft, and the erythematous rash with fine scale at the wrists, also support this diagnosis. The histopathologic image of immunohistochemical staining for spirochetes (Figure, C) shows the presence of spirochetes, which is consistent with VHS. Additionally, the patient's history of a small lesion appearing approximately 8 months prior and gradually growing and becoming painful over the past several months is consistent with the typical course of VHS. Therefore, option C, Verrucous herpes simplex virus, is the correct diagnosis.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as a nonhealing ulcer on the tongue, and the histopathological findings, such as a mixed cell infiltrate and intracellular yeast forms within histiocytes, are consistent with mucosal leishmaniasis. This diagnosis is supported by the patient's residence in the eastern part of India, where leishmaniasis is endemic. The other options, squamous cell carcinoma, primary oral histoplasmosis, and tubercular chancre, can also cause ulcers on the tongue, but do not match the patient's symptoms and histopathological findings.

Answer: B
Explanation: The advance-and-cut technique is the most appropriate method for removing the fishhook in this case. This technique involves rotating the hook anterogradely, clipping the barb, and then backing out the hook retrogradely through the entry wound. This approach allows for better control of the hook and minimizes the risk of further damage to the eye. The back-out technique (option A) may not be effective in this case due to the location of the hook in the anterior chamber and lower eyelid. The needle-cover technique (option C) may not be necessary in this case, as the hook is already exposed and can be directly accessed. The cut-and-push-through technique (option D) may not be appropriate, as it involves cutting the lure and making a corneal exit wound, which may not be necessary and may increase the risk of complications.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of decreased vision, confusion, and ataxia, along with the physical examination findings of mild abduction deficit, prominent upbeating nystagmus, and disc edema with peripapillary nerve fiber layer thickening and intraretinal hemorrhages, suggest a possible diagnosis of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). PRES is a rare condition that is often associated with rapid weight loss, hypertension, and electrolyte imbalances. The patient's recent bariatric surgery and significant weight loss may have contributed to the development of PRES. A lumbar puncture (Option A) may be necessary to rule out other causes of encephalopathy, but the imaging findings and clinical presentation suggest that PRES is a more likely diagnosis. Intravenous corticosteroids (Option D) may be considered for treating PRES, but the first step would be to perform an MRI/MRA (Option B) to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of the disease. Intravenous vitamin therapy (Option C) may also be considered, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management.

Answer: **B** Tracheoesophageal fistula
Explanation: A tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) is an abnormal connection between the trachea and esophagus that can cause food and liquids to enter the trachea, leading to choking and respiratory distress. The patient's symptoms of choking with feeds and large volume of clear oral secretions that required frequent suctioning are consistent with a TEF. The patient's history of difficult orotracheal intubation and requirement for mechanical ventilation also suggest a possible TEF. Additionally, the patient's age and recent respiratory issues increase the likelihood of a congenital anomaly such as a TEF. A fluoroscopic video swallowing study (FVSS) would be useful in confirming the diagnosis.

Gastroesophageal reflux (A) is a possibility, but the patient's symptoms of choking and large volume of clear oral secretions suggest a more severe anomaly. Esophageal perforation (C) is unlikely given the patient's age and absence of other symptoms such as fever, chest pain, or difficulty swallowing. Aspiration (D) is a possibility, but the patient's history of difficult intubation and requirement for mechanical ventilation suggest a more severe anomaly.

Explanation: Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis is a rare and benign condition that affects the gallbladder, characterized by the presence of xanthogranulomas, which are clusters of histiocytes admixed with lipid-laden macrophages. The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and weight loss, along with the physical examination findings of a positive Murphy sign and the imaging results of a thickened gallbladder wall infiltrating the liver parenchyma, are consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of cardiac arrhythmia, hypertension, and sigmoidectomy for diverticulitis may also be relevant to the patient's overall health and potential treatment plan, but they are not directly related to the likely diagnosis of xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis. Therefore, option C is the most appropriate answer.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of abdominal distension and vomiting, along with the absence of gas in the colon and rectum on the abdominal radiograph, suggest a small bowel obstruction. The delayed retention of contrast in the terminal ileum on the upper gastrointestinal series suggests that the obstruction is proximal to the rectum, which is consistent with small bowel volvulus. Additionally, the patient's history of chorioamnionitis and the presence of ganglion cells on suction rectal biopsy support this diagnosis. Cecal duplication (option A) is a rare congenital anomaly that can cause bowel obstruction, but it is not typically associated with volvulus. Infantile leiomyosarcoma (option C) is a rare soft tissue tumor that can occur in the gastrointestinal tract, but it is not typically associated with bowel obstruction. Ovarian cyst with torsion (option D) is a rare complication of ovarian cysts, but it is not typically associated with bowel obstruction or the other symptoms and findings in this case.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's elevated lactate level and abdominal pain are consistent with mesenteric ischemia, which can cause lactic acidosis. The patient's history of advanced diffuse large B-cell lymphoma involving the abdomen increases the likelihood of mesenteric ischemia due to compression or obstruction of the mesenteric vessels by the tumor. The patient's lack of fever and normal white blood cell count make sepsis less likely. The patient's history of nausea and vomiting and the presence of a large, tender mass in the abdomen also support the diagnosis of mesenteric ischemia. Therefore, option C is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of increasing dyspnea and chest wall tenderness, along with the history of a choking episode, suggest a possible aspiration pneumonia. The patient's age and history of hypertension and gastroesophageal reflux disease also increase the likelihood of a respiratory infection. Therefore, starting intravenous antibiotics, intravenous fluid resuscitation, and obtaining serum lactate level and blood and sputum cultures would be the appropriate next step in managing this patient's condition. Starting oxygen, β2-agonist nebulizer treatments, steroids, and oral azithromycin (option B) may be appropriate for patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but is not the most appropriate choice for this patient's symptoms and history. Starting aspirin, β-blocker, and considering cardiac catheterization (option C) is not necessary at this time, as there is no evidence of a cardiac condition. Observing and providing supplemental oxygen (option D) may be appropriate for patients with mild respiratory symptoms, but is not sufficient for this patient's severe symptoms.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's history of asymptomatic elevation of bilirubin, without any other signs of liver disease, and the absence of hemolysis, suggests Gilbert syndrome as the most likely diagnosis. Gilbert syndrome is a benign condition characterized by a mild elevation of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood, often found incidentally during routine laboratory tests. It is caused by a genetic defect in the gene encoding the enzyme UDP-glucuronosyltransferase, which is involved in the conjugation of bilirubin. The patient's daily alcohol consumption may also contribute to the elevated bilirubin levels, as alcohol can inhibit the activity of this enzyme. The absence of jaundice, pruritus, and family history of liver disease, as well as the normal liver function tests, further support this diagnosis. Cholelithiasis (A) is unlikely given the absence of symptoms and the normal liver function tests. Dubin-Johnson syndrome (B) is a rare condition that presents with conjugated hyperbilirubinemia, which is not seen in this case. Hemolysis (D) is also unlikely given the absence of any signs of hemolytic anemia.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms, which include a painless subareolar nodule that has been present for several months, along with the mammography and ultrasonography findings of multiple echogenic foci consistent with subareolar calcifications, are consistent with a diagnosis of low-grade adenosquamous carcinoma. This type of cancer is known to present with slow-growing, painless nodules in the nipple-areola complex, and the presence of calcifications on mammography is a common finding. The histopathologic features shown in the biopsy specimen, such as the irregular, fragmented nature of the epithelial cells and the presence of cystic spaces, are also consistent with this diagnosis. Therefore, option C, low-grade adenosquamous carcinoma, is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of skin fragility, mild xerosis, and superficial skin erosions, as well as the unusual linear geographic contour of some lesions, are consistent with epidermolysis bullosa simplex superficialis (EBS-S). EBS-S is a rare genetic disorder that affects the skin and mucous membranes, causing blistering and skin fragility. The patient's history of symptoms improving in winter and worsening in summer, and the absence of blistering, also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the skin biopsy results shown in Figure C, which reveal remarkable detachment of the entire stratum corneum and mild psoriasiform epidermis hyperplasia, are consistent with EBS-S.

Kindler syndrome, option A, is a rare genetic disorder that affects the skin and mucous membranes, causing skin fragility, blistering, and scarring. However, Kindler syndrome typically presents with more widespread and severe skin blistering, and the blisters are usually larger and more numerous than those seen in EBS-S.

Dermatitis artefacta, option B, is a psychocutaneous disorder characterized by self-induced skin damage. While the patient's history of peeling off skin with marked facility may suggest this diagnosis, the presence of superficial skin erosions and the unusual linear geographic contour of some lesions argue against it.

Peeling skin disease, option D, is a rare genetic disorder characterized by generalized skin peeling. However, the patient's symptoms of skin fragility and superficial skin erosions, as well as the absence of blistering, do not support this diagnosis.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia of the breast (Option A) is a rare condition that typically presents with a mass or swelling in the breast, but the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not support this diagnosis. Breast implant foreign body reaction (Option B) is also unlikely given the patient's history and clinical presentation.

Renal ultrasonography and lumbar puncture may also be considered to rule out any potential renal or central nervous system involvement. A metastatic workup may not be necessary at this time, as the patient does not have any signs or symptoms suggestive of a malignancy.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's history of hyperlipidemia and arthritis, along with the presence of retinal vascular abnormalities, suggests a possible diagnosis of hypertensive retinopathy. Elevated blood pressure can cause damage to the blood vessels in the retina, leading to changes such as arterial attenuation, arterial and venous sheathing, and focal areas of retinal thinning. Therefore, it would be appropriate to check the patient's blood pressure to help confirm the diagnosis.

Additionally, the patient's age and history of arthritis increase the likelihood of hypertension, making it a reasonable next step in the evaluation.

Checking the patient's antinuclear antibody level (option B) may also be useful in ruling out other potential causes of retinal vascular abnormalities, such as lupus or other autoimmune disorders. However, given the patient's history and physical examination findings, hypertensive retinopathy remains the most likely diagnosis.

Checking the patient's hemoglobin A1c level (option C) may also be useful in diagnosing and monitoring diabetic retinopathy, but it is not as relevant in this case given the absence of macular edema and the patient's normal blood sugar levels.

Explanation: Dissecting cellulitis is a bacterial infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue that presents with tender, red, and boggy nodules or plaques, often with yellowish discharge. The patient's history of tender, annular, scaly patches on the scalp and upper back, as well as the presence of significant posterior auricular and cervical lymphadenopathy, are consistent with this diagnosis. The loss of hair within the affected area on the scalp is also a common finding in dissecting cellulitis. Mycobacterial infection (option A) may present with skin lesions, but the presence of yellowish discharge and the absence of other signs of mycobacterial infection, such as scarring or pigmentation, make it less likely. Kerion celsi (option B) is a fungal infection that typically presents with a solitary, painful, erythematous nodule on the scalp, without the associated skin lesions or lymphadenopathy seen in this case. Abscess (option D) is a collection of pus that can result from bacterial infection, but the presence of tender, annular, scaly patches and the lack of a clearly defined abscess suggest that dissecting cellulitis is a more likely diagnosis.

Explanation: Retroperitoneal sarcoma is a rare type of cancer that develops in the soft tissue of the retroperitoneum, which is the area behind the abdominal organs. It is more common in older adults, and the symptoms can be non-specific, such as abdominal pain, weight loss, and fatigue. The patient's symptoms of worsening left-sided back pain over 4 months, with no other symptoms, are consistent with retroperitoneal sarcoma. The physical examination findings of mild left flank pain, but no costovertebral angle tenderness, also support this diagnosis. The imaging results, which show an exophytic, retroperitoneal mass with solid and cystic components involving the left kidney, posterior abdominal wall, and mesocolon, are also consistent with retroperitoneal sarcoma. The absence of any other abnormality on positron emission tomography–computed tomography and the negative findings on colonoscopy and mammography make retroperitoneal sarcoma the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, obstipation, fecaluria, and pneumaturia, along with the findings of hepatomegaly and left lower abdominal tenderness, suggest a possible gastrointestinal perforation. The patient's history of colon cancer and the presence of metastases to the liver, peritoneum, and omentum increase the likelihood of a perforation related to the cancer. The fact that the patient developed generalized peritonitis and abundant free air on computed tomography after colonoscopic stent placement further supports this diagnosis. Therefore, option B, "Stent perforation," is the most likely diagnosis.

Option A, "Colon cancer perforation," is a possible diagnosis, but it is less likely than option B since the patient's symptoms and findings suggest a more acute perforation related to the stent placement rather than a chronic perforation related to the cancer.

Option C, "Acute mesenteric ischemia," is unlikely since the patient's symptoms and findings do not suggest any evidence of bowel ischemia.

Option D, "Perforated diverticulitis," is also unlikely since the patient's symptoms and findings do not suggest any evidence of diverticulitis, and the presence of metastases to the liver, peritoneum, and omentum suggest a more likely diagnosis of colon cancer perforation.

Explanation: The patient's history of mild psoriasis that significantly worsened 1 year prior to presentation, and the physical examination findings of severe cachexia and diffuse plaques of thick, tan scale, hyperkeratotic areas verrucous and fissured over bony prominences, and linear excoriations diffusely, are all consistent with psoriasis. The patient's recent diagnosis of AIDS and low CD4 cell count suggest that the patient has psoriasis in the setting of HIV infection. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are not consistent with a fungal infection, and therefore prescribing a topical antifungal (C) would not be appropriate. Performing a skin scraping with microscopy (D) may be useful in diagnosing a fungal infection, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case given the patient's history and physical examination findings. Ordering syphilis serology (B) may be appropriate given the patient's HIV status, but it is not the most pressing concern given the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's presentation of tachycardia, hypotension, respiratory distress, oliguria, and peripheral cyanosis, along with a elevated lactate level, is consistent with sepsis. The patient's history of cirrhosis and liver dysfunction increases the likelihood of sepsis-induced liver injury, which can further elevate lactate levels. The patient's lactate level decreasing to 1.2 mmol/L (10.8 mg/dL) following admission and then increasing to 3.0 mmol/L (27.0 mg/dL) and 4.2 mmol/L (37.8 mg/dL) despite fluid resuscitation and vasopressor therapy suggests that the patient's sepsis is not well controlled. The patient's epinephrine-induced β2-adrenergic stimulation may also contribute to the elevated lactate levels, but it is not the primary cause of the patient's hyperlactatemia. Therefore, the correct answer is B, The patient likely has sepsis, possibly with an uncontrolled infectious source, that requires further workup.

Answer: D
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of erythema multiforme (EM), a type of skin rash that is often associated with viral infections. The presence of a burning sensation and the absence of pruritus also support this diagnosis. The distribution of the papules on the extensor surfaces of the patient's body, as well as the presence of a central yellow hue, are also consistent with EM.

Given the patient's history of pancreatitis, recent repair of a tibial fracture, and seizure disorder, it is possible that the rash is a result of a viral infection that has triggered an immune response. Therefore, unroofing one of the papules and sending it for viral culture (option D) would be the most appropriate next step in the patient's management. This would help to confirm the diagnosis of EM and potentially identify the underlying viral cause, which could guide further management and treatment.

Option A, obtaining a lipid panel, may be relevant for the patient's history of pancreatitis, but it would not be directly related to the patient's current rash. Option B, ordering a chest radiograph, may be appropriate if the patient had symptoms or signs suggestive of a respiratory infection, but it is not directly related to the patient's skin rash. Option C, treating empirically with oral prednisone, may be considered if the patient's rash was severe or widespread, but it would not be the most appropriate next step in the patient's management given the absence of severe symptoms and the need for a definitive diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of right-sided hearing loss, aural fullness, and occasional headache, along with the abnormal Weber and Rinne test results, are consistent with a right-sided conductive hearing loss. The notch at 2000 Hz on the audiogram is also consistent with otosclerosis. The patient's age and symptoms suggest early Meniere disease, which can cause both sensorineural and conductive hearing loss. Therefore, option C is the best answer.

Option A is incorrect because while the patient does have sensorineural hearing loss, it is not consistent with early Meniere disease, as the patient does not have the typical symptoms of Meniere disease such as vertigo, tinnitus, or otorrhea.

Option B is incorrect because the patient's age is 35, which is not consistent with age-related hearing loss, which typically affects people over the age of 60.

Option D is incorrect because while the patient does have a notch at 2000 Hz, it is not consistent with otosclerosis, as there is no evidence of fixation of the stapes bone.

Answer: C 
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including tender red lesions on the bilateral ankles and legs, fever, weight loss, fatigue, abdominal pain, bloating, vomiting, and diarrhea, are consistent with infectious panniculitis. Infectious panniculitis is a rare condition where the subcutaneous fat tissue becomes inflamed due to an infection. The patient's history of recent travel and exposure to a new environment increases the likelihood of an infection. The pathognomonic histopathologic findings demonstrated in the punch biopsy also support this diagnosis. Erythema nodosum (A) is a condition characterized by the development of tender, red nodules on the shins, but it is usually associated with a respiratory infection or sarcoidosis, which is not consistent with the patient's history. Pancreatic panniculitis (B) is a rare condition associated with pancreatic disease, which is not mentioned in the patient's history. α1-Antitrypsin deficiency (D) is a genetic disorder that can cause panniculitis, but it is not typically associated with the patient's symptoms or history.

The biopsy findings of needle-shaped clefts within the lumen of a blood vessel and minimal perivascular inflammation support this diagnosis. Cutaneous cholesterol embolism is a rare complication of endovascular procedures that can occur when cholesterol crystals are released into the bloodstream and embolize to the skin, causing a purpuric rash.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with scleritis, an inflammatory condition affecting the sclera. The patient's history of sinusitis and elevated inflammatory markers (erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein) support this diagnosis. The patient's previous treatment with antibiotics and artificial tears has not improved the condition, suggesting that the underlying cause is not bacterial conjunctivitis. Oral prednisone (Option C) would be an appropriate next step in managing this patient's condition, as it can help reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms. Injecting sub-Tenon capsule triamcinolone acetonide (Option B) may also be considered, but oral prednisone is a more appropriate first-line treatment. Referring the patient to an otolaryngologist for nasal mass biopsy (Option D) may also be necessary, but it is not the most urgent step in managing the patient's scleritis. Increasing topical corticosteroid frequency (Option A) may provide some symptomatic relief, but it is unlikely to address the underlying cause of the scleritis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination findings, including unilateral isolated disc edema and development of macular edema with exudates, suggest a possible diagnosis of optic neuritis. Optic neuritis is inflammation of the optic nerve that can cause vision loss or blindness. The patient's history of exposure to cats at home and lack of other systemic symptoms suggest a possible diagnosis of cat-scratch disease, which is caused by Bartonella henselae and can cause optic neuritis. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis (option C) would be the next step to confirm the diagnosis, as it can show an elevated white blood cell count and/or bacterial cultures positive for B. henselae. Repeated neuroimaging (option A) may not provide additional information, as the initial MRI scan did not show any masses or demyelinating lesions. Serum antibody titer (option B) may also not be helpful, as it may take several weeks for antibodies to develop. Blood culture analysis (option D) is unlikely to be useful, as cat-scratch disease is not typically associated with bacteremia.

Answer: C
Explanation: The clinical presentation of annular plaques on the scalp, with a thin red border and fine scaling, is consistent with tinea capitis. The presence of faintly pink patches with scaling on the medial eyebrows and mesolabial folds also supports this diagnosis. Tinea capitis is a common fungal infection of the scalp that affects children, and it is caused by a dermatophyte, most commonly Trichophyton tonsurans. The absence of cervical or postauricular lymphadenopathy and the lack of other symptoms such as fever, illness, or recent sun exposure also support this diagnosis.

Granuloma annulare (option A) is a chronic skin condition characterized by the formation of annular plaques with a thickened, scaly border. However, the plaques in granuloma annulare are typically larger and more widespread than those described in this case, and the condition often affects adults rather than neonates.

Neonatal lupus erythematosus (option B) is a rare autoimmune disease that can cause skin lesions in neonates. However, the skin lesions in neonatal lupus erythematosus are typically more widespread and may have a characteristic "butterfly" distribution across the nose and cheeks. Additionally, neonatal lupus erythematosus is often associated with other systemic symptoms such as liver and kidney involvement, which are not present in this case.

Annular urticaria (option D) is a skin condition characterized by the formation of annular plaques with a surrounding urticarial reaction. However, the plaques in annular urticaria are typically larger and more painful than those described in this case, and the condition often affects adults rather than neonates.

Therefore, based on the clinical presentation and the patient's age, tinea capitis is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of recurrent transient ischemic attacks and the recent minor stroke with amaurosis fugax, slurred speech, right-sided weakness, and facial droop lasting longer than 24 hours, along with the findings of subacute infarctions involving the left frontal and parietal hemispheres on magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, are consistent with symptomatic carotid stenosis. The computed tomographic angiography of the neck showed chronic occlusion of the right ICA and 95% stenosis of the left ICA, which supports the diagnosis. The absence of a carotid bruit and the presence of equally palpable upper extremity pulses bilaterally also suggest that the stenosis is not caused by atherosclerosis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is ruptured arterial plaque, which can cause symptomatic carotid stenosis.

The other options are less likely because:

A: Trapped air embolus is not consistent with the patient's symptoms or findings.
B: Free-floating arterial thrombus is not supported by the patient's history or physical examination.
D: Radiographic artifact is unlikely given the patient's symptoms and the findings on computed tomographic angiography.

Answer: B 
Explanation: The patient's history of total thyroidectomy and levothyroxine suppression therapy without evidence of recurrence suggests that the hypercalcemia is likely due to the thyroid suppression therapy. Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (Option A) is a rare genetic disorder that affects the calcium-sensing receptors in the parathyroid glands, leading to hypercalcemia and hypocalciuria. Hypercalcemia of malignancy (Option C) is a possibility, but the patient's history and physical examination do not suggest a malignancy. Primary hyperparathyroidism (Option D) is also a possibility, but the patient's history of thyroid cancer and thyroidectomy makes it less likely. Therefore, Option B is the most appropriate answer.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and computed tomography scan findings are consistent with a lung infection, possibly caused by aspiration or inhalation of bacteria. The patient's history of injection drug use and snorting drugs increases the likelihood of aspiration pneumonia. The patient's symptoms of swelling and pain over the nose, along with the pustule inside the nares that gradually spread to involve the nose, suggest a possible sinus infection. The patient's history of chronic hepatitis C increases the risk of developing sepsis. Therefore, it would be appropriate to treat the patient with intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics while awaiting the results of cultures and further diagnostic tests. Topical metronidazole (option C) may be effective for treating a skin infection, but it would not address the likely lung infection. Topical steroids (option D) would not be effective for treating a bacterial infection. Performing a skin biopsy (option A) may be necessary later, but it would not address the immediate concern of a possible life-threatening infection.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of painful generalized bullous eruptions, which appeared approximately 8 hours after taking two 25-mg doses of diclofenac, suggest a possible allergic reaction to the medication. The patient's history of a similar, though less severe, eruption 4 months earlier following diclofenac ingestion also supports this diagnosis. It is important to discontinue the medication to prevent further allergic reactions and to prevent the patient from experiencing any potential long-term side effects. Therefore, option B, "Discontinue diclofenac," is the best answer.

Option A, "Do nothing; the blisters will resolve over time," is not a good option as it does not address the underlying cause of the blisters and may allow the allergic reaction to continue.

Option C, "Prescribe oral antihistamines and continue diclofenac," may provide some relief from the itching and burning sensation, but it does not address the underlying cause of the blisters and may not prevent further allergic reactions.

Option D, "Prescribe oral corticosteroids," may provide some relief from the inflammation and itching, but it is not the most appropriate treatment for an allergic reaction. Corticosteroids are typically used to treat inflammatory conditions, but they may not address the underlying cause of the blisters and may have side effects, especially in an elderly patient.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, as well as the histopathologic and direct immunofluorescence results, are consistent with a diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis. Dermatitis herpetiformis is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by the deposition of IgA antibodies in the skin, leading to a petechial eruption. The presence of granular IgA deposition within the dermal papillae and at the dermoepidermal junction, as shown in the direct immunofluorescence image, supports this diagnosis. The patient's history of long-standing type 1 diabetes mellitus and the absence of other symptoms or laboratory abnormalities suggest that this is a case of isolated dermatitis herpetiformis, rather than a systemic autoimmune disorder.

Janeway lesions (option A) are small, painless, red or purple macules that can occur on the palms and soles in patients with endocarditis. The patient's lesions are not typical of Janeway lesions, as they are persistent, asymptomatic, and do not have the characteristic red or purple color.

Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (option B) is a autoimmune disorder characterized by a low platelet count and a risk of bleeding. The patient's history of asymptomatic petechiae without a low platelet count or other signs of bleeding makes this diagnosis less likely.

Petechiae due to pinprick testing (option D) is a possible diagnosis, but it is less likely given the patient's history of long-standing diabetes and the absence of other signs of bleeding or platelet dysfunction.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as trachyonychia, cutis laxa, and easy bruising, are consistent with amyloidosis. The histopathological findings, specifically the presence of orange, amorphous, and extracellular material deposited in the subungual dermis of the nail bed, and the intense apple-green birefringence of the amorphous material in the subungual dermis under polarized light microscopy, are also consistent with amyloidosis. Additionally, the patient's age and the presence of diffuse nonscarring alopecia, purpuric patches, and multiple skin-colored linear kissing plaques on the gluteal cleft, are also consistent with amyloidosis. Lichen planus of the nails, cutaneous sarcoidosis, and alopecia areata do not typically present with these symptoms and histopathological findings. Therefore, the diagnosis is amyloidosis.

Answer: C
Explanation:
The clinical case describes a patient with a history of burns and subsequent development of black plaques and white nodules. The patient had undergone emergent surgeries and was later taken to the operating room for debridement and grafting. The patient's hospital course was complicated by recurrent polymicrobial aspiration pneumonia caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus. The patient's symptoms and the presence of black plaques and white nodules suggest a fungal infection. The histopathologic images, original magnification ×50, show the presence of fungal organisms, specifically Fusarium and Mucormycosis, which support the diagnosis of fungal infection. Therefore, the correct answer is option C, Fusarium and Mucormycosis.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient presents with a conjunctival papillomatous lesion, which is a benign growth of conjunctival epithelium. The lesion is relatively rapidly growing, and the patient has no other symptoms or signs of systemic disease. Treatment with prednisolone acetate, 1%, ophthalmic solution 4 times per day is appropriate to reduce inflammation and promote regression of the lesion. Orbital imaging (magnetic resonance imaging) (A) may be considered to rule out other orbital lesions, but it is not the most appropriate next step. Reassure and observe (C) may be considered if the lesion is small and not growing, but in this case, the lesion is relatively rapidly growing, and treatment is warranted. Cryotherapy (double–freeze-thaw method) (D) is not appropriate for this type of lesion.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient has a small area of shallow retinal detachment with associated retinal pigment epithelial pigment changes in the inferotemporal periphery of the left eye, which may be related to the lesion under the left lower eyelid. Given the presence of a possible retinal detachment, it is important to treat the lesion promptly to prevent further complications. Episcleral radioactive plaque treatment, with or without concomitant needle biopsy, would be the most appropriate next step in management, as it can help to treat the lesion and prevent further growth or spread of the disease. Excisional or incisional biopsy may not be appropriate at this time, as they may disrupt the retina and exacerbate the retinal detachment. Observation may not be sufficient, as the lesion has already been present for 3 years and has possibly grown slightly, and the patient's symptoms and signs suggest a more urgent need for treatment.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including fever, rash, and arthralgia, are consistent with Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF). The presence of petechial and pustular lesions on the palms and soles, as well as the patient's history of exposure to ticks and rodents, also support this diagnosis. RMSF is a tick-borne illness caused by Rickettsia rickettsii, and it is characterized by a distinctive rash and fever. The patient's swollen and warm joints, as well as her pain with passive movement, are also consistent with RMSF.

The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and history as well. Disseminated gonococcal infection (option A) is unlikely given the patient's age and lack of sexual history. Streptobacillus moniliformis infection (option B) can cause a rash and fever, but it is typically associated with rat bites, which the patient did not report. Disseminated Staphylococcus aureus (option D) can cause fever and joint pain, but it is not typically associated with a rash or exposure to ticks or rodents.

Answer: B 
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of chronic diarrhea, weight loss, and abdominal mass suggest a possible gastrointestinal tumor. The microcytic anemia and hypoalbuminemia also support this diagnosis. A gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) with central necrosis is a possible diagnosis, as it can cause chronic bleeding and inflammation leading to diarrhea and weight loss. The immobile mass in the left upper abdomen and the central necrotic mass shown in the CT image also support this diagnosis. Gastrointestinal tuberculosis is less likely as it typically presents with fever, night sweats, and weight loss over a longer period. Gastrocolic fistula is also less likely as it typically presents with abdominal pain, fever, and altered bowel habits. Gastric leiomyosarcoma is a rare tumor that can cause abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, but it is less likely to cause chronic diarrhea and weight loss. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is B: Gastrointestinal stromal tumor with central necrosis.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of persistent nausea and vomiting, weight loss, and iron deficiency anemia are consistent with occult gastrointestinal bleeding. The fact that upper and lower endoscopy, computed tomography enterography, PillCam capsule endoscopy, and a Meckel scan failed to identify a source of bleeding suggests that the bleeding is coming from a location that is difficult to visualize with these tests. The retrograde double-balloon enteroscopy showed an outpouching in the distal ileum with ulceration of the adjacent mucosa, which is consistent with a Meckel diverticulum. The gross specimen resected distal ileum revealing an ulceration of the mucosa, supports this diagnosis. Therefore, the correct answer is B: Meckel diverticulum.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of colicky epigastric and right upper quadrant pain, along with the absence of fever, nausea, or vomiting, and the physical examination findings of mild tachycardia, moderate abdominal distension, and hyperactive bowel sounds, are consistent with a diagnosis of lesser sac (omental bursa) internal hernia through the epiploic foramen. The computed tomography images support this diagnosis, showing the border of the epiploic foramen and the air-filled cecum in the lesser sac. The absence of any previous abdominal surgery and the lack of signs of peritonism also support this diagnosis.

The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms and examination findings. Option A, abscess of the lesser sac (omental bursa), would likely cause more severe symptoms, including fever, nausea, and vomiting, and may have resulted in signs of peritonism. Option B, perforated ulcer of the posterior stomach wall, would also cause more severe symptoms and may have resulted in signs of peritonism. Option D, large diverticle of the transverse colon, does not fit the patient's symptoms or examination findings, as it would likely cause symptoms of colonic obstruction or bleeding.

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation of progressive numbness in her hands, absence of diabetes mellitus and alcohol consumption, and normal laboratory test results, except for an unexplained neuropathy, are consistent with a diagnosis of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). MGUS is a condition where an M protein is produced in excess, but the level is not high enough to be considered multiple myeloma. The patient's protein electrophoresis and immunofixation results show a small M-protein peak, which is consistent with MGUS. The free light chain assay result is also consistent with MGUS. Therefore, option B is the correct answer.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's presentation of a rapidly progressive painful ulceration on the left leg, with intermittent high fevers, and a history of chronic diarrhea, is consistent with necrotizing fasciitis. The histopathological changes shown in the skin lesion, including dermal edema, dense infiltration of neutrophils, and vascular fibrinoid necrosis, also support this diagnosis. Necrotizing fasciitis is a surgical emergency that requires prompt surgical debridement and skin grafting. Therefore, the best next step would be to surgically excise the lesion, followed by skin grafting (option C). Changing dressings daily and implementing hyperbaric oxygen therapy (option A) may help to promote wound healing, but they are not sufficient to treat the underlying infection. Prescribing systemic corticosteroids (option B) may help to reduce inflammation, but they are not the primary treatment for necrotizing fasciitis. Continuing with broad-spectrum antibiotics (option D) may help to treat any underlying bacterial infection, but surgical debridement is still necessary to remove the infected tissue.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's history of hypertension and physical examination findings of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) are consistent with chronic elevation in cardiac troponin T (cTnT). Additionally, the echocardiogram showed moderate LVH with preserved left ventricular systolic function, which supports this diagnosis. The patient's chest pain and shortness of breath may be due to increased myocardial oxygen demand from hypertension, but this does not meet the criteria for a type I or type II non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI). The patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and inferior T-wave inversion, which is consistent with chronic elevation in cardiac troponin T (cTnT) due to left ventricular hypertrophy. Therefore, option A is the most appropriate answer.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's reactive syphilis test results, along with the absence of any neurologic deficits, suggest that they have latent syphilis. Latent syphilis is characterized by the absence of symptoms and a positive serologic test result. In this case, the patient's positive syphilis test result and lack of symptoms suggest that they have latent syphilis. The recommended treatment for latent syphilis is 2.4 million U of benzathine penicillin G weekly for 3 doses, which is option A.

Option B is incorrect because the patient's low titers do not necessarily indicate that they do not require treatment. Low titers can still indicate the presence of syphilis, and treatment is necessary to ensure that the infection is fully cleared.

Option C is incorrect because there is no indication that the patient's titers are falsely elevated. The patient's positive syphilis test result suggests that they have been infected with the bacteria, and repeat testing is not necessary.

Option D is incorrect because the patient does not have any neurologic symptoms or signs of asymptomatic neurosyphilis. A lumbar puncture is not necessary in this case, and treatment with antibiotics is the appropriate next step.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of recurrent gingival and oral mucosal lesions, along with the presence of white striae (Wickham striae) affecting the gingiva and mucosa, are consistent with a diagnosis of oral lichen planus (OLP). OLP is a chronic inflammatory disease that affects the oral mucosa and can cause pain, bleeding, and difficulty brushing teeth. The patient's history of hypertension, hypothyroidism, type 2 diabetes, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and seasonal allergies may also be relevant to the patient's overall health and potential treatment plan, but they are not directly related to the likely diagnosis of OLP.

The recommended treatment for OLP includes topical corticosteroids, which can help reduce inflammation and alleviate symptoms. Increased use of an alcohol-based mouthwash may not be effective in treating OLP and may even exacerbate the condition by further irritating the oral mucosa. Valacyclovir (1000 mg 3 times daily) for 7 days may be effective in treating viral infections, but it is not the most appropriate treatment for OLP. A nutritional assay to evaluate for vitamin B3 (niacin) deficiency may be useful in some cases of OLP, as some studies suggest that niacin deficiency may play a role in the development of OLP, but it is not the most urgent step in the patient's management. Biopsy of the affected tissue may be necessary in some cases to establish a definitive diagnosis, but it is not the most appropriate step at this point in the patient's management.

Answer: A: Amyloidosis
Explanation: The patient's history of recurrent oral mucosal ulcerations and gingival edema, along with the presence of ligneous conjunctivitis, suggests a diagnosis of amyloidosis. The patient's age and the duration of the symptoms also support this diagnosis. The histopathological findings of aggregates of relatively amorphous, eosinophilic material beneath the epithelium and around blood vessels, as seen in the punch biopsy specimen, are consistent with amyloidosis. Additionally, the patient's history of easy bruising and prolonged bleeding, as well as the absence of any abnormal findings on complete blood cell count with differential and comprehensive metabolic panel, also support this diagnosis. Systemic sclerosis (option B) is less likely given the absence of skin tightening and thickening, and the presence of ligneous conjunctivitis. Hypoplasminogenemia (option C) is a rare genetic disorder that can cause periodontal disease, but it is not typically associated with oral mucosal ulcerations or conjunctivitis. Lipoid proteinosis (option D) is a rare condition that can cause oral mucosal lesions, but it is not typically associated with conjunctivitis or the other symptoms described in this case.

Answer: C
Explanation: The clinical presentation of widespread vesicles and erosions, along with the histopathological findings of suprabasilar acantholysis and an eosinophil-rich infiltrate, are consistent with neonatal pemphigus vulgaris. The direct immunofluorescence findings of IgG in an intracellular "chicken wire" pattern in the lower spinous layer also support this diagnosis. Pemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune bullous disorder that can present in neonates, and the presence of flaccid purulent vesicles and crusting on the chest, as well as the sparing of mucous membranes, are consistent with this diagnosis. The absence of a history of herpesvirus infection and the negative direct immunofluorescence for herpes simplex virus (HSV) further support this diagnosis. Epidermolysis bullosa, Dowling-Meara type, typically presents with blisters and erosions in response to minor trauma, and the histopathological findings are different from those seen in pemphigus vulgaris. Bullous impetigo typically presents with localized blisters and crusting on the face and extremities, and the histopathological findings are also different from those seen in pemphigus vulgaris. Neonatal herpesvirus infection can cause a variety of skin lesions, including vesicles and erosions, but the presence of suprabasilar acantholysis and an eosinophil-rich infiltrate on histopathology, as well as the negative HSV cultures and PCR, make this diagnosis less likely.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's history of sun exposure and the presence of annular plaques with raised erythematous-violaceous borders on the face and torso, as well as the absence of scaling, are consistent with the diagnosis of neutrophilic sebaceous adenitis. The pathologic findings of distended sebaceous lobules with associated follicular dilatation and a mild chronic perivascular and perifollicular lymphomononuclear infiltrate, as well as sebaceous lobules with sebocyte necrosis and an associated neutrophilic infiltrate, also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's symptoms of joint pain and swollen nodes, which resolved without treatment, are consistent with a systemic inflammatory response, which is commonly seen in neutrophilic sebaceous adenitis.

Granuloma annulare (option A) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by the formation of annular plaques with a violaceous border, but it typically does not have the same degree of follicular involvement as seen in neutrophilic sebaceous adenitis. Cutaneous lupus (option B) can also present with annular plaques, but it typically has a more widespread distribution and is associated with other systemic symptoms, such as arthritis, fever, and hair loss, which are not present in this case.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and clinical appearance, as well as the results of the punch biopsy, are consistent with erythema ab igne with superimposed chemotherapy effect. Erythema ab igne is a condition that occurs when the skin is exposed to heat or cold, causing inflammation and damage to the skin cells. In this case, the patient's exposure to the fireplace and cold weather may have contributed to the development of the condition. The presence of dysmaturation and apoptotic cells, increased small blood vessels, pigment incontinence, and perivascular inflammation with lymphocytes and eosinophils in the biopsy specimen support this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of stage IV, progressive, neuroendocrine pancreatic cancer and recent use of chemotherapeutic regimens, including oral etoposide and monthly octreotide acetate intramuscular injections, may have contributed to the development of the skin eruption. The other options, psoriasis vulgaris, pityriasis rubra pilaris, and cutaneous lupus erythematosus, do not fit the patient's clinical presentation or biopsy results.

Answer: D Administer intravitreal injection of an anti–vascular endothelial growth factor agent
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of retinal vasculitis, specifically, retinal periphlebitis. The dark crescent seen on fundus autofluorescence and the delayed perfusion with hypofluorescence on fluorescein angiography support this diagnosis. The patient's history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2 increases the likelihood of this diagnosis. Administering an intravitreal injection of an anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agent is a reasonable next step in management, as it can help to reduce the inflammation and prevent further vision loss. Performing ocular ultrasonography (option A) may also be useful in evaluating the retinal thickness and detecting any associated retinal edema, but it is not the most urgent step in management. Obtaining optical coherence tomography (option B) may also be helpful in evaluating the retinal structure and identifying any areas of retinal thinning or edema, but it is not as urgent as administering anti-VEGF therapy. Obtaining blood tests for vasculitis workup (option C) may also be considered, but the patient's clinical presentation and examination findings are more consistent with retinal vasculitis, and the blood tests may not be as useful in confirming the diagnosis.

Answer: A
Explanation: Immediate surgical re-exploration is the most appropriate next step in this case. The patient's symptoms of acute visual loss and ophthalmoplegia in the right eye, along with the physical examination findings of diffuse retinal whitening and a cherry-red spot in the macula, suggest a possible posterior communicating artery aneurysm or other intracranial vascular abnormality. The fact that the patient had an uncomplicated elective clipping of a right middle cerebral artery aneurysm just a short time ago suggests that there may have been a missed or inadequately treated aneurysm that is now causing problems. Surgical re-exploration is necessary to evaluate the aneurysm and determine the appropriate course of action.

Emergent angiography (option B) may also be considered, but surgical re-exploration is a more urgent and necessary step in this case, as the patient's symptoms are severe and suggest a potentially life-threatening condition. Immediate anticoagulation (option C) may also be considered, but it is not the most urgent step in this case, as the patient's symptoms suggest a more immediate surgical emergency. Lateral canthotomy and cantholysis (option D) are not appropriate in this case, as they are not related to the patient's symptoms or suspected diagnosis.

Explanation: The most likely diagnosis for the chest mass in the newborn is a dermoid cyst. Dermoid cysts are benign growths that are present at birth and are made up of skin cells, hair follicles, and sweat glands. They are usually located on the head, neck, or trunk, and are typically soft and mobile. The firmness and non-homogeneous texture of the mass on palpation, as well as the absence of discoloration of the overlying skin, are consistent with a dermoid cyst. Infantile hemangioma (A) is a benign vascular tumor that typically appears as a red, purple, or blue mass, and is not consistent with the described appearance of the mass. Neuroblastoma (B) is a malignant tumor that arises from the sympathetic nervous system, and is unlikely to present as a mass on the trunk in a newborn.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain, along with the findings of dilated small intestine and air-fluid levels on the contrast-enhanced CT scan, are consistent with a diagnosis of sclerosing encapsulated peritonitis (SEP). SEP is a rare condition characterized by the encasement of the small intestine in a fibrous membrane, leading to bowel obstruction. The patient's history of occupational exposure to asbestos increases the likelihood of this diagnosis, as asbestos has been linked to the development of SEP. The tightly coiled and twisted segment of small intestine encountered intraoperatively is also consistent with SEP. The other options, peritoneal mesothelioma, malrotation with Ladd bands, and peritoneal encapsulation, can also cause bowel obstruction, but do not fit the patient's symptoms and imaging findings as well as SEP.

Explanation: The patient's history of recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding and melena, along with the physical examination findings of multiple fleshy, soft cutaneous nodules, suggests a diagnosis of neurofibroma. Neurofibromas are benign tumors that arise from the peripheral nerves and can cause bleeding due to their vascularity. The patient's prior history of γ-knife resection of an acoustic neuroma also supports this diagnosis, as neurofibromas are commonly associated with neurofibromatosis type 2, a genetic disorder that affects the growth and development of nerve tissue. The absence of abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, fevers, or chills, and the lack of an obvious palpable mass on physical examination, also support the diagnosis of neurofibroma over other possibilities such as carcinoid tumor or gastrointestinal stromal tumor. The imaging findings of a large, complex, septated, right-upper-quadrant abdominal mass, are also consistent with neurofibroma.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's history of recurrent UTIs, positive urine culture, and symptoms such as increased confusion, urinary frequency, cloudy urine, lethargy, hallucinations, and falls are all consistent with a UTI. The patient's chronic incontinence also increases the risk of UTI. While a positive urinalysis and urine culture are not always indicative of a UTI, in this case, they support the diagnosis. Asymptomatic pyuria and bacteriuria (option A) are possible, but the patient's symptoms and history suggest a more severe infection. Option C is incorrect because a positive urinalysis and urine culture are not always indicative of a UTI, and option D is incorrect because the patient's history of recurrent UTIs does not necessarily mean that she has another UTI without other supporting symptoms and test results.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of left facial droop and left leg weakness, along with the cystic brain lesions shown on T1-weighted MRI, suggest a possible diagnosis of a brain abscess. The presence of multiple ring-enhancing fluid collections in the right basal ganglia, insula, and frontal lobe also supports this diagnosis. It is important to consult neurosurgery for biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

Option A, beginning therapy with intravenous ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and metronidazole, may be appropriate for a patient with a suspected infection, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as the diagnosis of a brain abscess requires further evaluation and confirmation before starting antibiotic therapy.

Option B, performing a lumbar puncture, may be necessary to collect cerebrospinal fluid for further evaluation, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as the patient's symptoms and MRI findings suggest a more urgent need for neurosurgical intervention.

Option D, starting systemic corticosteroids, may be considered in certain cases of brain abscess to reduce inflammation and swelling, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case, as the diagnosis has not been confirmed and the patient's symptoms do not suggest significant inflammation or swelling.

Answer: C 
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with cutaneous larva migrans, also known as "creeping eruption." This is a parasitic infection caused by the larvae of the hookworm Ancylostoma braziliense. The lesions typically appear as red, serpiginous lines or circles on the skin, and can be accompanied by vesicles or bullae. The patient's recent travel to Puerto Rico, where hookworm infections are more common, increases the likelihood of this diagnosis. Therefore, the appropriate next step would be to prescribe oral anthelmintic therapy, which is effective in treating cutaneous larva migrans. Topical steroids (option B) may provide some symptomatic relief, but they will not treat the underlying infection. Oral antibiotics (option D) are not effective against parasitic infections, and doing nothing (option A) could allow the infection to persist and potentially worsen.

The mitogen response is positive, which suggests that the patient's immune system is functioning properly. The patient's lack of symptoms and normal laboratory results also support the diagnosis of no LTBI. Therefore, further evaluation for active TB disease is not necessary, and the patient does not require treatment for LTBI.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's history of rapidly enlarging lesions on his calf, thigh, and cheek, along with the physical examination findings of a tender, nodular plaque and subcutaneous masses, are consistent with cutaneous lymphoma. The elevated LDH level and positive EBER in situ hybridization results support this diagnosis. Cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a type of T-cell lymphoma that can present with skin lesions, and the patient's symptoms and laboratory results are consistent with this diagnosis. Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (B), can also present with skin lesions, but the patient's age and the absence of nasal involvement make this diagnosis less likely. Blastomycosis (C) is a fungal infection that can cause skin lesions, but the patient's history and physical examination findings do not suggest this diagnosis. Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma (D) is a rare type of T-cell lymphoma that can present with skin lesions, but the patient's age and the absence of panniculitis make this diagnosis less likely.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and histopathological findings are consistent with generalized essential telangiectasia (GET). GET is a rare condition characterized by the development of multiple small telangiectasias on the skin, particularly on the face, neck, and extremities. The telangiectasias are typically small, punctate, and blanchable, and may coalesce to form larger, retiform patches, as seen in this case. Unlike hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), GET does not have a familial pattern and is not associated with visceral involvement or bleeding diathesis. Cutaneous collagenous vasculopathy (CCV) is a condition that can also present with similar skin findings, but it is typically associated with a history of trauma or sun exposure, and histopathology shows a different pattern of collagen deposition. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) can also present with cutaneous vasculopathy, but it typically has a more widespread distribution and is associated with other systemic symptoms and laboratory abnormalities, such as autoantibodies and immune complex deposition.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as tender, reddish brown, slightly pruritic papules and plaques on the scalp, in the inframammary region, and in the perineum, and the presence of well-demarcated, moist, erythematous plaques and erosions in the bilateral inframammary regions and the intertriginous regions of the groin, are consistent with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). The abundance of atypical cells with reniform nuclei within the epidermis and papillary dermis, as seen in the punch biopsy specimen, also supports this diagnosis. LCH is a rare histiocytic disorder that can affect various parts of the body, including the skin, and is characterized by the presence of Langerhans cells, which are a type of dendritic cell. The patient's history of treatment failure with multiple courses of topical and systemic antifungals, topical and systemic corticosteroids, and oral antibiotics also suggests that the condition is unlikely to be caused by an infection or an allergic reaction, which would have responded to these treatments. Therefore, option C, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and findings are consistent with a traumatic macular hole (MH) caused by the airbag deployment. The presence of whitening of the macula, central red spot, flame-shaped hemorrhages, and cotton-wool spots are all consistent with MH. The subfoveal debris seen on OCT also supports this diagnosis. The patient's vision loss and reported discomfort are also consistent with MH. Given the patient's recent trauma and the presence of MH, it is important to evaluate for secondary gain. Secondary gain refers to the development of a full-thickness macular hole in the fellow eye, which can occur in cases of severe trauma. Therefore, option C, "Evaluate for secondary gain," is the most appropriate next step in management. Option A, "Reassure and observe," may be appropriate for patients with less severe trauma or those who have already been monitored for a significant period, but it is not the most appropriate choice given the severity of the patient's symptoms and findings. Option B, "OCT imaging," may be useful in monitoring the patient's condition, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management. Option D, "Electroretinogram," is not directly related to the patient's symptoms or findings and is therefore not the most appropriate next step in management.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and findings, including bilateral decreased vision, bilateral retinal hemorrhages, and a peripapillary preretinal gliotic lesion in one eye, suggest a possible inflammatory or infectious etiology. Neuroimaging of the brain and orbits (option B) would be the most appropriate next step to evaluate for potential intracranial or orbital inflammatory or infectious processes that may be contributing to the patient's symptoms. This would include MRI or CT scans of the brain and orbits with and without contrast, as well as possibly MRI-guided biopsy if indicated. Diagnostic pars plana vitrectomy (option A) may also be considered, but would be more invasive and may not provide the same breadth of information as neuroimaging. Anterior chamber paracentesis for polymerase chain reaction (option C) may be considered if there is a high suspicion of an infectious etiology, but would not provide the same level of information as neuroimaging. Blood cultures (option D) may also be considered, but would not provide information on the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

Answer: C
Explanation: The correct answer is C, Venous malformation. The clinical presentation of numerous grouped hemorrhagic vesicles, along with the histopathological findings of dilated thin-walled vascular spaces containing valvelike papillary projections in the superficial dermis, are consistent with a venous malformation. The patient's history of recurrent abscess formation and the lack of pain or itching also support this diagnosis. Microcystic lymphatic malformation (A) is unlikely given the absence of lymphatic channels and the presence of dilated vascular spaces. Congenital melanocytic nevus (B) is not a likely diagnosis as it typically presents as a pigmented lesion and does not explain the vascular changes seen in the biopsy. Nevus sebaceous (D) is a rare benign tumor that typically presents as a yellowish, nodular lesion on the face and does not match the clinical or histopathological findings in this case.

The lesion in the second and third portions of the duodenum involving the pancreatic head, as well as the multiple nodules along the peritoneal reflection of the right paracolic gutter, are consistent with metastases. The patient's history of a previous laparoscopic cholecystectomy increases the likelihood of a pancreatic cancer diagnosis. The patient's elevated bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, and alkaline phosphatase levels are also consistent with pancreatic cancer. Therefore, option C, peritoneal carcinomatosis, is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and imaging findings are consistent with an inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT). IMTs are rare soft tissue tumors that can occur in various parts of the body, including the abdominal wall. They are usually slow-growing and may not cause any symptoms in the early stages. The patient's tender and firm flank mass, which decreased in size over time, is consistent with an IMT. The imaging findings, including the hypoechoic lesion on ultrasonography and the T2 hyperintense lesion with diffuse surrounding soft tissue edema on MRI, also support this diagnosis. The positive immunostains for actin and negative immunostains for S100 and desmin on the biopsy specimen further support the diagnosis of IMT.

The other options are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and imaging findings. Desmoid fibromatosis (option A) is a rare soft tissue tumor that can occur in various parts of the body, including the abdominal wall. However, it typically presents as a slowly growing, painless mass, and the imaging findings are not consistent with this diagnosis. Nodular fasciitis (option C) is a benign tumor that typically presents as a rapidly growing, painful mass in the soft tissues. The imaging findings and biopsy results do not support this diagnosis. Leiomyosarcoma (option D) is a malignant smooth muscle tumor that can occur in various parts of the body, including the abdominal wall. However, it typically presents as a rapidly growing, painful mass, and the imaging findings and biopsy results do not support this diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, such as nasal erythema, swelling, and crusting, as well as the presence of cervical lymphadenopathy, are consistent with a diagnosis of leishmaniasis. The fact that the patient traveled to the rainforests of Salto Ángel, Venezuela, where leishmaniasis is endemic, further supports this diagnosis. The biopsy results showing pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia and lymphoplasmocytic inflammation are also consistent with leishmaniasis. Therefore, it would be appropriate to perform leishmaniasis polymerase chain reaction testing of biopsied tissue to confirm the diagnosis. Prescribing intravenous vancomycin for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection (option D) would not be appropriate as there is no evidence of a bacterial infection, and the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are not consistent with this diagnosis. Obtaining immunofluorescence of biopsied tissue (option A) may also be useful in diagnosing leishmaniasis, but it is not as specific as PCR testing. Performing a biopsy with oncology consultation (option B) may also be necessary, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case.

Answer: C
Explanation: The correct diagnosis is Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS). EBS is a rare genetic disorder characterized by fragile skin that blisters and tears easily, often in response to minor trauma or friction. The patient's history of asymptomatic flesh-colored to translucent papules on her palms and soles, with depressed centers and no extension onto the dorsal aspect of the hands, is consistent with EBS. The presence of hyperkeratotic yellow plaques with scattered pits over her bilateral soles, concentrated in areas of pressure, also supports this diagnosis. The patient's history of exacerbation by alcohol-based hand sanitizer and water exposure, as well as the lack of improvement with urea cream, are also consistent with EBS. The patient's family history, with similar skin findings in her mother, further supports this diagnosis. The histopathologic findings, shown in Figure C, are also consistent with EBS, demonstrating a subepidermal blister with an intact basement membrane zone, indicating a diagnosis of EBS.

The other options do not fit the patient's clinical presentation and histopathologic findings. Hereditary papulotranslucent acrokeratoderma (Option A) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by multiple small, translucent papules on the palms and soles. While this condition may have a similar appearance to EBS, it typically has a different distribution and is not associated with blistering or fragile skin. Dyshidrotic pemphigoid (Option B) is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by blistering and sores on the hands and feet. However, it typically presents with more widespread and severe blistering, and the histopathologic findings are different from those seen in EBS. Dyshidrotic eczema (Option D) is a type of eczema that affects the hands and feet, but it is not associated with blistering or fragile skin, and the histopathologic findings are different from those seen in EBS.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of fever, rigors, periorbital swelling, and painful perivulvar eruption, along with the histopathologic findings of spongiosis, hyperplasia of the epidermis, and neutrophilic infiltrate within the dermis, are consistent with deep fungal or atypical mycobacterial infection. The destruction of collagen and eccrine glands also supports this diagnosis. Sweet syndrome typically presents with painful, erythematous, and edematous plaques on the skin, but the presence of violaceous and indurated plaques sparing the vaginal mucosa and inguinal creases, and the absence of any other signs of Sweet syndrome, make it less likely. Herpes genitalis can cause perivulvar lesions, but the absence of viral culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) evidence, as well as the lack of typical herpetic lesions, make it less likely. Perivulvar neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis is a rare condition that can cause perivulvar nodules and plaques, but the absence of any history of prior radiation therapy or chemotherapy, and the lack of any other signs of this condition, make it less likely.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's history of chronic myeloid leukemia and bone marrow transplantation, as well as the presence of well-demarcated keratotic margins and structureless brownish pigmentation on dermoscopy, suggest a diagnosis of cutaneous graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The patient's treatment history, including intermittent use of intramuscular triamcinolone acetonide depot and various topical treatments, also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's lack of response to treatments for lichen planus annularis, such as corticosteroids and retinoic acid, further supports the diagnosis of cutaneous GVHD. The patient's age and the duration of the lesions also align with the typical presentation of cutaneous GVHD. Therefore, option D, cutaneous graft-versus-host disease, is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: D
Explanation: The patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis and long-term use of methotrexate suggest a possible association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). EBV is known to be associated with certain types of lymphoma, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), which is the diagnosis in this case. Given the patient's history and the presence of atypical lymphocytes in the eyelid lesion, it would be appropriate to determine the EBV status to help guide further management. Observation following cessation of methotrexate therapy may also be considered, as the patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis and long-term use of immunosuppressive therapy may have contributed to the development of the lymphoma. Initiating treatment with radiation and/or chemotherapy (option A) or rituximab (option B) may be appropriate depending on the results of further testing and the patient's overall health status, but determining the EBV status and considering observation are the most appropriate next steps. Excise the eyelid lesion (option C) may not be the most appropriate option as it may not address the underlying lymphoma.

Answer: D: Anti–vascular endothelial growth factor therapy.
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of intractable choroidal effusion and exudative retinal detachment are indicative of neovascularization, which is a common complication in patients with Sturge-Weber syndrome. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy is a well-established treatment for neovascularization in such cases. It works by blocking the growth factor that promotes the formation of new blood vessels, thereby reducing the risk of bleeding and improving vision.

In contrast, drainage of the choroidal effusion (option A) may provide temporary relief but is unlikely to address the underlying cause of the neovascularization. Oral steroids (option B) may help reduce inflammation but are not specifically targeted towards the neovascularization. Oral propranolol (option C) is used to treat infantile hemangioma, but its efficacy in treating choroidal neovascularization is not well established.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including the linear band of skin-colored papules on his left upper extremity and the whorled configuration of vesicles on his left medial thigh, are consistent with Incontinentia pigmenti (IP). IP is a rare genetic disorder that affects the skin and nervous system, and is characterized by the development of skin lesions in a linear or whorled pattern. The patient's history, with no similar lesions in his sibling or mother, and the absence of any history of herpes simplex virus or varicella in the mother, also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's age and the fact that the lesions have been present since birth further support the diagnosis of IP.

Varicella-zoster virus (A) is a viral infection that causes chickenpox and shingles, but it does not present with the characteristic linear or whorled pattern of IP. Herpes simplex virus (C) can cause skin lesions, but it is not typically associated with a linear or whorled pattern.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of abrupt vomiting and abdominal pain, along with the physical examination findings of tenderness to palpation on the right side of the paraumbilical point, suggest a possible small-bowel obstruction. The patient's history of adhesive ileus, which is a known complication of partial oophorectomy, supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the abdominal CT scan showing a mass on the right side of the paraumbilical point, which is likely a small-bowel loop, further supports the diagnosis of small-bowel volvulus. Intussusception (A) is unlikely given the patient's age and lack of symptoms suggestive of intestinal obstruction. Colon cancer (B) is also unlikely given the patient's age and the absence of other symptoms such as rectal bleeding or change in bowel habits. Mesenteric ischemia (D) is unlikely given the absence of symptoms such as abdominal pain out of proportion to physical examination findings, and the lack of evidence of vascular disease on CT scan.

Answer: D: Right thoracotomy with primary closure and mesh placement.
Explanation: The patient presents with an unusual hernia that has developed through a 12-cm defect in the abdominal wall, which is large enough to accommodate abdominal contents such as the liver, ascending colon, and omental fat. The hernia is also extending superiorly to the costal margins and inferiorly to the anterior-superior iliac spine, which suggests that it is a significant defect that requires repair.

Given the size and location of the hernia, a right thoracotomy with primary closure and mesh placement would be the most appropriate next step. This approach allows for direct visualization and repair of the hernia defect, and the use of mesh placement can help reinforce the weakened abdominal wall and reduce the risk of recurrence.

The other options do not seem as appropriate for this case. Video-assisted thoracic surgery reduction (Option A) may be a viable approach for some hernia repairs, but it may not provide adequate visualization and access to the large defect in this case. Transabdominal laparoscopic reduction and mesh placement (Option B) may also be a possible approach, but it may be more technically challenging and may not provide the same level of visualization and control as a thoracotomy. Video-assisted thoracic surgery reduction with primary closure (Option C) may also be considered, but it does not address the issue of mesh placement to reinforce the abdominal wall.

Answer: C 
Explanation: A retroperitoneal abscess would be a likely diagnosis given the patient's symptoms of intermittent left upper quadrant abdominal pain, nausea, and constipation, which are consistent with an intra-abdominal infection. The patient's history of chronic hepatitis B increases the likelihood of a bacterial infection. Additionally, the patient's recent liver biopsy may have introduced bacteria into the retroperitoneal space. The absence of any other symptoms, such as fever or chills, and the lack of any palpable masses or costovertebral angle tenderness on physical examination, also support this diagnosis. The patient's age and lack of any other significant medical history reduce the likelihood of other retroperitoneal masses such as a serous cystadenoma of the pancreas (option A), endothelial adrenal cyst (option B), or pheochromocytoma (option D). The patient's normal laboratory test results, including a normal hepatitis B virus quantification level, also support this diagnosis.

The patient's history of epistaxis also supports this diagnosis. Therefore, the next step would be to consult a neurosurgeon to evaluate the brain CT finding and obtain a CT scan of the lung and abdomen to rule out any metastasis. Additionally, genetic counseling for the patient and her family would be appropriate to discuss the possibility of a genetic predisposition to this type of tumor.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a malar rash, which is a common side effect of long-term immunosuppression, particularly in patients who have undergone stem cell transplantation. The patient's history of myelofibrosis and allogeneic peripheral hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, as well as his current use of acyclovir, suggest that he is immunosuppressed. The patient's rash and other symptoms, such as fever, muscle pain, and weakness, are consistent with a diagnosis of acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). A skin punch biopsy would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of GVHD and to rule out other potential causes of the rash. Therefore, option B, "Obtain a skin punch biopsy to confirm the diagnosis," is the correct answer.

Option A, "Order anti-dsDNA, anti-Smith, and antihistone antibody tests," may be relevant for diagnosing and monitoring certain autoimmune disorders, but it is not directly related to the patient's current symptoms and physical examination findings.

Option C, "Start high-potency topical steroid, topical calcineurin inhibitor, or both," may be appropriate for treating certain skin conditions, but it is not the most appropriate next step for this patient, given the severity and distribution of the rash and the patient's history of immunosuppression.

Option D, "Start systemic immunosuppressive therapy," may be necessary for treating acute GVHD, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this time, given that the patient is already receiving immunosuppressive therapy and has a history of GVHD. The patient's current symptoms and physical examination findings suggest that the GVHD is still active, and starting additional immunosuppressive therapy may not be effective in controlling the disease.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of numbness of the forehead and intermittent eyelid edema, along with the physical examination findings of decreased sensation in the distribution of the ophthalmic branch of the left trigeminal nerve and a palpable mass at the left supratrochlear notch, suggest a possible diagnosis of a neurofibroma or meningioma. These types of tumors can cause compression of the trigeminal nerve and result in symptoms such as numbness and tingling. The patient's age and medical history, including hypertension and prostate cancer, also support the possibility of a neurofibroma or meningioma. Therefore, the next step would be to administer empirical corticosteroid treatment to reduce swelling and alleviate symptoms, as well as to perform further diagnostic tests such as an MRI or CT scan to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of the tumor. Performing external beam radiotherapy or orbitotomy with biopsy may be considered later on in the treatment plan, but would not be the most appropriate next step at this point. Observing the patient without any further intervention would not be appropriate given the presence of a palpable mass and the patient's symptoms.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of "shimmering lights" and blurry vision in his right eye, along with the physical examination findings of small yellow-white retinal lesions, are consistent with a diagnosis of retinal vasculitis. The fluorescein angiogram findings of hyperfluorescent lesions during the early and late phases and late optic nerve staining, suggest a possibility of a retinal vasculitis. Treating the patient with oral corticosteroids would be the next step in management, as it can help to reduce inflammation and prevent further damage to the retina.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results, along with the histological examination of the excised lymph node, are consistent with coccidioidomycosis. The patient's recent travel history and residence in Los Angeles, California, also support this diagnosis, as coccidioidomycosis is endemic in the southwestern United States. The patient's age and lack of immunocompromising conditions also fit with the demographic typically affected by coccidioidomycosis. The other options, tuberculosis, nontuberculous mycobacterial infection, and lymphoma, can also present with cervical adenopathy and other symptoms, but are less likely given the patient's history and test results.

Answer: C 
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including massive splenomegaly, fatigue, early satiety, and back pain, along with the absence of constitutional symptoms such as fevers, night sweats, chills, arthralgias, or weight loss, suggest a diagnosis of splenic lymphangiomatosis. This is a rare condition characterized by multiple benign lymphangiomas in the spleen, which can cause splenomegaly and other symptoms. The patient's history of a migratory, urticaric maculopapular rash also supports this diagnosis, as it is a common symptom of splenic lymphangiomatosis. The absence of any personal or family history of hematologic diseases or lymphoma makes Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (option D) less likely. Splenic pelosis (option A) is a rare condition characterized by multiple small pellets in the spleen, which can cause splenomegaly but not the other symptoms described in the patient's history. Echinococcal splenic cystic disease (option B) is a parasitic infection that can cause splenomegaly and other symptoms, but it is not associated with a rash or the patient's other symptoms. Therefore, option C, splenic lymphangiomatosis, is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation, with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteremia and prosthetic valve endocarditis, suggests that the central catheter was placed in the left internal jugular vein for vasoactive medications and intravenous antibiotics. The fact that the catheter went in easily without resistance, was drop tested to confirm venous placement, and flushed and drew easily, and venous waveforms and pressures were transduced, supports this. The chest radiograph showing the left internal jugular catheter placement (arrowhead) also supports this diagnosis. Therefore, option B (Catheterization of left internal thoracic vein) is the correct answer.

Option A (Catheterization of left pericardiacophrenic vein) is incorrect because the catheter would not have been placed in the pericardiacophrenic vein, as it is not a common location for central venous catheterization.

Option C (Catheterization of left anomalous pulmonary vein) is also incorrect because the patient's clinical presentation does not suggest any pulmonary vein anomalies, and the catheter would not have been placed in the pulmonary vein.

Option D (Catheterization of left superior intercostal vein) is incorrect because the catheter would not have been placed in the superior intercostal vein, as it is not a common location for central venous catheterization.

Answer: D
Explanation: The patient's history of recurrent painful skin lesions and oral lesions, along with the positive HSV IgG serologic testing, suggests a diagnosis of erythema multiforme major (EMM), which is associated with HSV infection. The patient's history of HCV infection and the presence of hyperpigmented, annular papules with dusky centers and bullae on her arms and legs bilaterally, are also consistent with EMM. The patient's oral lesions, consisting of erythematous, crusted papules with superficial ulceration, gingival hyperplasia, and superimposed thrush, are also consistent with EMM. Therefore, prescribing oral prednisone and HSV viral suppression therapy would be an appropriate next step in management.

Option A, checking serum cryoglobulin level, may be relevant in the evaluation of some autoimmune diseases, but it is not directly related to the patient's symptoms or diagnosis.

Option B, administering intradermal progesterone challenge, is not relevant to the patient's symptoms or diagnosis, and may not be appropriate given the patient's history of HCV infection.

Option C, prescribing interferon, ribavirin, and telaprevir, is a treatment regimen for HCV infection, but it is not directly related to the patient's skin and oral lesions, and may not be appropriate given the patient's history of recurrent EMM.

Answer: D: Obtain a biopsy of the lesion for pathological examination.
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a possible diagnosis of genital psoriasis or squamous cell carcinoma. A biopsy would be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and guide further management. Empiric treatment with topical steroids (option A) may not be effective for these conditions and could potentially worsen the symptoms. Initiating treatment with valacyclovir (option B) would not be appropriate as the patient does not have symptoms consistent with herpes simplex virus infection. Ordering laboratory studies to rule out syphilis (option C) may be appropriate, but a biopsy would still be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's history of hypertension and diabetes, along with the laboratory results showing a high aldosterone-renin ratio (ARR), suggest primary aldosteronism. However, the patient's recent discontinuation of medications, such as hydrochlorothiazide and atenolol, may have affected the results. Therefore, option B is the best answer, as it suggests that imaging is required for confirmation of the diagnosis. Option A is incorrect because the diagnosis cannot be confirmed based solely on the laboratory results. Option C is also incorrect because an aldosterone suppression test is not necessary for diagnosis. Option D is incorrect because the results are not unreliable, but rather, they suggest the possibility of primary aldosteronism.

Answer: C: Repeat lumbar puncture
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of transient blurred vision, along with the findings of numerous foci of enhancement throughout the brain on magnetic resonance imaging, suggest a possible diagnosis of a neurodegenerative disorder such as multiple sclerosis. A repeat lumbar puncture would be appropriate to evaluate for abnormalities in the cerebrospinal fluid, such as elevated protein levels or oligoclonal bands, which could support this diagnosis. Additionally, a repeat lumbar puncture would allow for further evaluation of the patient's cerebrospinal fluid for possible infectious causes, such as meningitis or encephalitis, which could also be contributing to her symptoms.

It is unlikely that screening for autoantibodies (option A) would be helpful in this case, as the patient's symptoms and examination findings do not suggest a clear autoimmune disorder. Fluorescein angiography (option B) is a test used to evaluate the retina and choroidal circulation, and would not be relevant to the patient's symptoms or suspected diagnosis. Carotid ultrasonography (option D) may be appropriate to evaluate for carotid artery disease, but it would not be directly related to the patient's current symptoms or suspected diagnosis.

Answer: D: Order serum titers of IgM and IgG for Bartonella henselae
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of photopsias, blurry vision, and decreased peripheral vision, along with the physical examination findings of red desaturation and decreased color vision, suggest a possible diagnosis of neuroretinitis. Neuroretinitis is an inflammatory condition that affects the retina and can be caused by a variety of factors, including infections. Bartonella henselae is a bacterium that has been associated with neuroretinitis, and serum titers of IgM and IgG can be used to diagnose Bartonella infection. Therefore, ordering serum titers of IgM and IgG for Bartonella henselae would be an appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation.

The other options do not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and are therefore not appropriate next steps:

* Option A, observe the patient, is not a specific or effective plan for evaluating and managing the patient's symptoms.
* Option B, start steroid therapy, may be considered later in the patient's management, but it is not a necessary step at this point in the patient's evaluation.
* Option C, perform magnetic resonance imaging, may be considered to evaluate the patient's symptoms, but it is not a specific test for diagnosing neuroretinitis or Bartonella infection.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's history of recurrent orbital swelling and proptosis, along with the physical examination findings of conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, and limited extraocular movements, suggest a diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma of the extraocular muscles. The imaging findings of severe proptosis with stretching of the optic nerve and thickening of the rectus muscles and soft tissues, as well as the involvement of the inferior and lateral extraocular muscles, are also consistent with this diagnosis. Rhabdomyosarcoma is a type of cancer that develops in the soft tissues of the body, including the muscles, and can affect the orbit. The patient's age and the rapid progression of symptoms also support this diagnosis. Orbital cellulitis (option A) is an infection of the orbit that can cause swelling and redness, but it would not explain the patient's history of recurrent symptoms or the imaging findings. Idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome (option C) is a condition that can cause orbital inflammation, but it is less likely given the patient's age and the presence of proptosis. Thyroid ophthalmopathy (option D) is a condition that can cause proptosis and swelling of the eyelids, but it is not associated with the other symptoms and findings in this case.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of lower abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, along with the palpable mass in the lower right abdominal quadrant, are consistent with a diagnosis of ileal intussusception. The abdominal ultrasonographic examination and abdominal computed tomography results, which showed a suggestive ileal intussusception, support this diagnosis. Additionally, the presence of a bulge in the cecal lumen, revealed by colonoscopy, further supports the diagnosis of ileal intussusception. The patient's history of visiting the emergency department two weeks prior with the same symptoms and receiving conservative treatment also suggests that the diagnosis is not appendiceal abscess, as the symptoms would have likely worsened over time if it were an abscess. Therefore, option B, ileal intussusception, is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and imaging findings are consistent with a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST). MPNSTs are rare soft tissue sarcomas that arise from peripheral nerves and are associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), as in this patient's family history. The patient's son has a history of NF1, which increases the likelihood of this diagnosis. The patient's symptoms of a new pelvic mass, without urinary or bowel symptoms, are consistent with MPNST. The imaging findings of a heterogeneously enhancing mass within the prostatic bed, with central necrosis, are also consistent with MPNST. The positive immunohistochemical staining for desmin, smooth muscle actin, pan-keratin, and S100, along with the negative staining for CD34 and CDK4, support this diagnosis. Additionally, the absence of MDM2 gene amplification, which is a characteristic feature of MPNST, further supports this diagnosis. Therefore, option C, Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, is the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as a rapidly growing mass, spontaneous drainage of pus, and unexplained weight loss, along with the physical examination findings of a tender, fluctuant mass with surrounding erythema, are consistent with a diagnosis of giant infiltrating lipoma. The imaging findings of a large soft-tissue mass extending from the diaphragm to the iliac crest and invading the liver also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the fact that the core needle biopsy showed inconclusive results and a fresh tissue biopsy was recommended suggests that the mass is likely benign, which is consistent with a diagnosis of giant infiltrating lipoma. Malignant sarcoma would be a more aggressive and malignant tumor, and would not likely have the same benign features. Fungal mycetoma is a rare condition that typically presents with a slowly growing mass and would not explain the patient's symptoms of rapid growth and spontaneous drainage of pus. Bacterial abscess would not explain the patient's symptoms of a rapidly growing mass or the imaging findings of a large soft-tissue mass invading the liver.

Explanation: The patient's positive anti-HCV result indicates that she has been infected with the hepatitis C virus at some point in her life. However, the absence of elevated aminotransferase levels and the presence of a low viral load suggest that she has cleared the infection, either spontaneously or through treatment. The fact that she is asymptomatic and has a normal liver function test result also supports this interpretation. Therefore, option B, "This patient has antibody to HCV and is no longer infected," is the correct answer.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, along with the chest radiograph, suggest a possible lung infection or inflammation. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest would be the next appropriate step in the diagnostic workup. The CT scan would provide a higher resolution image of the lung tissue and would be able to detect any areas of consolidation, pleural effusion, or pneumonia that may not be visible on the chest radiograph. Additionally, the CT scan would also be able to evaluate the mediastinum and the surrounding tissues.

Therefore, option B: Obtain a computed tomography scan of the chest, is the correct answer.

Option A: Perform a bronchoscopy and obtain bronchoalveolar lavage for culture and sensitivity, may be necessary later on in the diagnostic workup, but it would not be the next step.

Option C: Perform an infectious workup including a complete blood cell count, blood culture, sputum culture, and purified protein derivative test to rule out pulmonary tuberculosis, would be appropriate if the patient had a positive history of tuberculosis exposure or if there were other signs and symptoms suggestive of tuberculosis, but it is not the most appropriate next step based on the patient's current presentation.

Option D: Treat with oral antibiotics, would not be appropriate at this time, as the diagnosis has not been established and antibiotics should not be started empirically without a confirmed diagnosis.

Answer: C 
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of cutaneous vasculitis. A punch biopsy of the lesion would be the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis and determine the specific type of vasculitis. This would also help to rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, such as infection or malignancy. Obtaining a radiograph of the lower leg (option A) may be unnecessary at this point and would not provide information specific to the patient's skin lesion. Obtaining antinuclear antibody levels (option B) may be helpful in diagnosing a connective tissue disorder, but it is not directly related to the patient's current symptoms. Obtaining blood cultures and prescribing empirical antibiotics (option D) would be appropriate if there were signs of infection, but the patient's lack of systemic symptoms and the appearance of the lesion do not suggest infection.

Answer: D
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of progressive anemia, left upper quadrant pain, and weight loss, along with the palpable spleen edge and stable splenic hemangioma on CT scans, suggest a possible splenic rupture or bleeding. The patient's history of polycythemia vera increases the likelihood of a bleeding complication. Therefore, it is appropriate to obtain a surgical consultation for splenectomy. This is the most urgent and appropriate step in managing the patient's condition.

Conservative management with transfusions, fluids, and analgesics (Option A) may be necessary, but it is not the most urgent step. Obtaining a bone marrow biopsy (Option B) may be useful in evaluating the patient's polycythemia vera, but it is not the most urgent step in managing the patient's current symptoms. Obtaining an urgent upper endoscopy (Option C) may be necessary to evaluate for gastrointestinal bleeding, but it is not the most appropriate step given the patient's history of polycythemia vera and the presence of a splenic hemangioma.

Answer: C: Perform tarsorrhaphy.
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of blurry vision, redness, and corneal thinning, along with the physical examination findings of inferior corneal epithelial defects, bilateral corneal thinning, and anterior uveitis, suggest a diagnosis of neurotrophic keratitis. Tarsorrhaphy, a procedure that involves sewing the eyelids shut for a period of time, is a common treatment for neurotrophic keratitis. It is done to promote healing of the corneal epithelial defects and to reduce the risk of corneal perforation.

The other options are not appropriate for the patient's condition. Oral prednisone (option A) may be used to treat inflammation, but it would not address the underlying cause of the neurotrophic keratitis. Bandage contact lenses (option B) may be used to protect the cornea, but they would not promote healing of the corneal epithelial defects. Prescribing lubrication with autologous serum tears (option D) may provide some relief for dryness, but it would not address the underlying cause of the neurotrophic keratitis.

Answer: D
Explanation: The correct answer is D, surgical removal of the cyst and pathological analysis. The patient's symptoms of a moving black spot in their visual field, along with the physical examination findings of a translucent and brown oval-shaped lesion in the right eye, suggest the presence of a cyst. The patient's young age and lack of other symptoms also support this diagnosis. Surgical removal of the cyst and pathological analysis would be the next step in order to confirm the diagnosis and determine the underlying cause of the cyst. The other options, A, B, and C, may not provide the necessary information to diagnose and treat the patient's condition. A computerized tomographic scan (A) may not be able to visualize the cyst, and anterior segment tomography with Pentacam (B) may not provide the same level of detail as surgical removal and pathological analysis. Systemic treatment with albendazole (C) is not indicated for a cyst and may not be effective in treating the underlying cause.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's history of Crohn disease and recent exposure to ibuprofen suggest a possible diagnosis of Lyme disease. The pink-violaceous patches on the lower back, buttocks, and thighs are consistent with the erythema migrans rash associated with Lyme disease. Additionally, the patient's fatigue and low-grade fever are also symptoms of Lyme disease. It is important to note that Lyme disease is commonly found in areas with heavy wooded areas and animals, which is consistent with the patient's living situation.

It is less likely that the patient has fixed drug eruption (A) as the rash is not typically associated with this condition. Tinea corporis (B) is also unlikely as the patient does not have any symptoms of a fungal infection and the rash is not consistent with this condition. Granuloma annulare (D) is unlikely as the patient does not have any skin lesions consistent with this condition.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of constant, burning upper abdominal pain, morning nausea, and worsening of pain by food and alcohol, along with the physical examination findings of a faintly palpable midabdominal mass and localized discomfort to palpation, are consistent with a diagnosis of angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia (AFLH). AFLH is a rare benign condition characterized by the proliferation of lymphoid tissue in the mesentery, which can cause abdominal pain and discomfort. The patient's family history of a brother with kidney stones and the patient's history of smoking and alcohol use may also support this diagnosis, as AFLH has been associated with genetic predisposition and exposure to certain environmental factors. The ultrasonography and computed tomography scan findings of a hypervascular soft tissue mass in the mesentery, as well as the gross surgical specimen and histopathologic analysis, are also consistent with AFLH. Carcinoid tumor, desmoid tumor, and gastrointestinal stromal tumor are less likely diagnoses based on the patient's symptoms and imaging findings. Therefore, the correct answer is C: Angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of diffuse lower abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, along with the physical examination findings of tachycardia and a distended, diffusely tender abdomen, are consistent with a hemoperitoneum. The computed tomography (CT) scan findings of a large amount of free fluid throughout the abdomen and pelvis, with an area of focal density consistent with a hematoma in the left midabdomen, support this diagnosis. Additionally, the irregularity of the right gonadal vein and the heterogeneous and bulky uterus suggest a possible bleeding source. Mesenteric hematoma is the most likely diagnosis, as it can cause hemoperitoneum and explain the patient's symptoms and CT scan findings. Duodenal injury (option A) may also cause hemoperitoneum, but it is less likely given the patient's symptoms and CT scan findings. Avulsed uterine fibroid (option C) is a possible bleeding source, but it is less likely than mesenteric hematoma given the patient's age and the absence of any history of fibroids. Right gonadal vein injury (option D) is also a possible bleeding source, but it is less likely than mesenteric hematoma given the patient's symptoms and CT scan findings.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including a reduced Glasgow Coma Scale score, trismus, scalp hematoma, and lactic acidosis, suggest a possible infection or poisoning. The presence of bullae and painless, dry, black punctate lesions on the patient's skin suggest a possible bacterial or viral infection. Therefore, it would be appropriate to order intravenous antibiotics to treat any potential infection. Additionally, the patient's left leg is flexed and swollen, which may indicate a possible musculoskeletal infection or injury. Imaging of the left leg (option A) may also be necessary to determine the extent of any musculoskeletal damage, but antibiotics should be started first to treat any potential infection. Option C, observation and cardiac monitoring, may be necessary to monitor the patient's vital signs and cardiac function, but it is not the most urgent step in the patient's management.

Explanation: The patient's clinical presentation of paroxysmal tachycardia, oxygen desaturation, and pulmonary edema, along with the laboratory results of elevated B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), are consistent with congestive heart failure (CHF). The patient's history of invasive adenocarcinoma of the cecum and recent laparoscopic right hemicolectomy also increase the likelihood of CHF. In contrast, there is no evidence to suggest a pulmonary embolus or symptomatic anemia. While a pulmonary artery catheter may be useful in some cases of CHF, it is not necessary in this patient's current situation. Therefore, the best course of action is to initiate loop diuretic therapy to manage the patient's CHF.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and clinical findings are consistent with a possible diagnosis of ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN). The large, firm, fungating mass with overlying pigment changes and tortuous feeding vessels observed on the left eye is highly suggestive of OSSN. The patient's history of a pterygium surgery on the left eye 1 year ago increases the likelihood of this diagnosis, as OSSN can arise from previous ocular surface trauma or surgery.

Topical interferon drops are a common treatment for OSSN, and are often used as a first line therapy to reduce the size of the lesion and prevent further growth. Excisional biopsy may also be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine the extent of the lesion. Enucleation, or removal of the eye, is not necessary at this stage and would be a more invasive and drastic measure. Therefore, the best course of action would be to prescribe topical interferon drops followed by excisional biopsy, which is option B.

Explanation: The correct answer is B, Reassure parents and follow up in 3 months. The patient presents with a white pupillary reflection, also known as leukocoria, which can be a sign of various ocular conditions, including cataracts, glaucoma, or retinal detachment. However, in children, a white pupil can also be a normal variant, especially in the absence of other symptoms or signs of ocular disease. Therefore, it is appropriate to reassure the parents and follow up with the patient in 3 months to monitor for any changes or progression of the condition. It is not necessary to perform a funduscopic examination (option A) or obtain serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for Toxocara canis (option C) at this time, as they may not provide any additional information that would change management.

Answer: B
Explanation: A shave biopsy would be the most appropriate next step in diagnosing and managing the patient's condition. The patient's history of a gradually enlarging and thickening yellow-orange nodule on his thigh, along with the verrucous and vascular appearance of the lesion, suggests a possible diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma. A shave biopsy would allow for a definitive diagnosis and would also provide information about the depth of invasion and margins of the lesion, which would guide further management. Ultrasonography or MRI (Option A) may also be useful in evaluating the extent of the lesion, but a biopsy would still be necessary for a definitive diagnosis. Immediate excision (Option C) may be appropriate depending on the results of the biopsy, but it is not the next step in the diagnostic workup. Liquid nitrogen treatment (Option D) is not a recommended treatment for squamous cell carcinoma and may not be effective in destroying all of the culprit cells.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of nausea and low-grade fever, along with the presence of an air-containing abscess and a stent in the common iliac artery, suggest a diagnosis of iatrogenic pancreas transplant thrombosis. The patient's history of simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation 15 years ago and the recent peripheral angiogram procedure suggest that the stent graft was deployed to the right common iliac artery, which may have caused the thrombosis. The patient's low blood pressure and absence of distress also support this diagnosis.

The other options are less likely:

A: Ruptured acute appendicitis is unlikely given the patient's age and absence of abdominal pain.

B: Cecal inflammation with abscess is possible, but the presence of a stent in the common iliac artery and the patient's history of pancreas transplantation make iatrogenic pancreas transplant thrombosis more likely.

D: Hematoma is not supported by the patient's symptoms or examination findings.

Answer: C. Carcinoid tumor of the appendix.
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of right lower quadrant pain, loss of appetite, nausea, and vomiting, along with the presence of an abnormal-appearing cecum on imaging, suggest a possible appendiceal pathology. The patient's history of nephrolithiasis also increases the likelihood of a gastrointestinal tract obstruction. The histologic analysis of the resected appendix showing positive progesterone receptor immunostaining supports the diagnosis of a carcinoid tumor of the appendix. This diagnosis is also consistent with the patient's age and gender, as carcinoid tumors of the appendix are more common in young adults and women.

The other options are less likely given the patient's symptoms and imaging findings. Acute appendicitis (option A) would typically present with more severe and widespread abdominal pain, as well as signs of peritoneal irritation such as guarding and rebound tenderness. Cecal diverticulum (option B) is a less common condition that may present with symptoms similar to appendicitis, but the patient's age and lack of other symptoms such as fever and change in bowel habits make it less likely. Appendiceal intussusception (option D) is a rare condition that may present with similar symptoms, but the patient's history of nephrolithiasis and the absence of other signs of intestinal obstruction make it less likely.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a benign bony growth on the hard palate, possibly a torus palatinus. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head would be the next appropriate step to confirm the diagnosis and rule out any other potential causes of the growth. A biopsy may not be necessary at this point, as the appearance and location of the growth suggest a benign etiology. Referring the patient to an oral surgeon for evaluation and full-mouth dental x-rays may also be appropriate, but the CT scan should be performed first to guide further management. Therefore, option C is the best answer.

Explanation: The patient's chronic nail pigmentation, with no associated symptoms and no history of acute or recurrent trauma, suggests a benign condition. A punch biopsy of the nail bed through the intact nail plate would be the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis. This method allows for a targeted sampling of the pigmented area and minimizes the risk of nail damage or infection. Additionally, it would provide a definitive diagnosis, which would be important for the patient's peace of mind and to rule out any potential malignancy. The other options, such as reassuring the patient without further evaluation, removing the entire nail plate, or sending clippings for histopathology and culture, may not provide a definitive diagnosis or may be more invasive than necessary.

Answer: C
Explanation: Discontinuing interferon therapy would be the next step because the patient's history of cirrhosis and the presence of cotton-wool spots and retinal hemorrhages suggest a possible diagnosis of diabetic retinopathy. Interferon can exacerbate this condition, and discontinuing it may help prevent further vision loss.

Option A, checking hemoglobin A1c level, may also be relevant in managing the patient's diabetes, but it would not be the most immediate step given the patient's symptoms and physical findings.

Option B, checking for hypertension, is important in the management of patients with diabetes and retinopathy, but it is not the most pressing concern in this case given the presence of retinal hemorrhages and cotton-wool spots.

Option D, contacting the patient's hepatologist, may be necessary in the future, but it is not the most urgent action needed at this time. The patient's liver disease may also need to be managed, but the immediate focus should be on addressing the patient's vision loss and potential diabetic retinopathy.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's history of a papular eruption localized to the back, with lesions that have evolved into pustules and blisters, and the presence of grouped papules in a linear array, are consistent with the diagnosis of scabies. The fact that all other family members had significant improvement with permethrin treatment, while the patient's lesions continued to worsen, suggests that the patient may have had a resistant form of scabies. The patient's age and the presence of hemorrhagic crust and surrounding scale on the lesions also support this diagnosis. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (A) is a rare disorder characterized by the proliferation of Langerhans cells, which can cause skin lesions, but it is not typically associated with a history of scabies. Contact dermatitis (B) can cause skin lesions, but it is not typically associated with a history of scabies and would not explain the patient's age and the presence of hemorrhagic crust and surrounding scale on the lesions. Postscabetic acropustulosis (D) is a complication of scabies that occurs weeks to months after the initial infection and is characterized by the development of crusted papules and pustules on the palms and soles, but it is not typically associated with a history of scabies in infants.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and test results indicate that they have an angioleiomyoma, a rare, benign vascular tumor. The tumor's location near the pancreas, its hypoechoic appearance on ultrasound, and its arterial enhancement on CT scans are all consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the presence of small, singly dispersed vessels embedded in a background of fascicles of spindled cells with monotonous, fusiform nuclei and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm, as well as the strong, diffuse cytoplasmic staining for desmin, are also consistent with an angioleiomyoma. The absence of mitotic activity, cytologic atypia, or areas of necrosis supports the diagnosis of a benign tumor. Therefore, option B, Angioleiomyoma, is the correct answer.

Answer: C
Explanation:
The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of anal neoplasm. The mass exteriorized through the anal canal, covered by hypoxemic rectal mucosa, and the absence of a digestive lumen inside the mass, are all consistent with a neoplastic growth. Additionally, the patient's history of vomiting and absence of bowel movements or intestinal gas for 2 days, suggest an intestinal obstruction, which is a common complication of anal neoplasms. The absence of abdominal tenderness and the presence of air-fluid levels on the abdominal radiograph, also support this diagnosis.

The other options are less likely:

A: Hedrocele is a fluid-filled sac that forms around the testicle, usually due to injury or infection. It is not related to the patient's symptoms or physical examination findings.

B: Rectal prolapse is a condition where the rectum protrudes through the anus, usually due to weakening of the muscles and ligaments that support the rectum. The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings do not suggest this diagnosis.

D: External hemorrhoids are swollen veins in the anus, which can cause pain, bleeding, and itching. They are not typically associated with vomiting, abdominal distension, or intestinal obstruction, as seen in this patient.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, including oral ulcers and targetoid lesions on the palms, are consistent with a diagnosis of primary herpetic gingivostomatitis (PHG), which is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). A skin biopsy of a targetoid lesion on the palm would help to confirm the diagnosis.

It is unlikely that a chest radiograph (option A) would be helpful in diagnosing PHG, as it is a viral infection that does not typically affect the lungs. A rapid plasma reagin test (option B) might be useful in diagnosing syphilis, but it is not typically used to diagnose HSV infections. Performing a viral culture from a lip lesion (option D) could also help to confirm the diagnosis, but it may not be as practical or efficient as a skin biopsy.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's recent-onset skin lesions, particularly the erythematous, indurated plaque with a central black hemorrhagic crust surrounded by yellow pustulovesicles on the left shin, are concerning for a skin infection. The patient's history of recent rituximab therapy and immunocompromised status increase the likelihood of a severe infection. Therefore, it is appropriate to obtain a skin biopsy to determine the cause of the skin lesions and to apply a topical antibiotic to both the perianal area and the shin area until the pathology result is available. This will help to prevent further spread of the infection and potentially reduce the risk of serious complications.

The other options are not as appropriate for several reasons. Option B, obtaining bacterial culture from both areas and starting a systemic antibiotic, may not be effective in treating a potential fungal infection. Option C, obtaining both bacterial and fungal cultures and administering both a systemic antibiotic and a systemic antifungal agent, may be excessive and unnecessary at this point, as there is no clear indication of a fungal infection. Option D, obtaining fungal culture from both affected areas and initiating systemic antifungal therapy, may also be premature, as there is no clear evidence of a fungal infection.

This information will help guide further management and follow-up. Option B, pars plana vitrectomy and retinal biopsy, may be necessary if the lesions are causing vision loss or are suspicious for malignancy, but it is not the next step in management.

Answer: C
Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, including the painful bullous skin lesion, generalized myalgia, polyarthralgia, joint stiffness, paraesthesia, and episodic ankle swelling, are consistent with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The appearance of livedo reticularis, a reticulated, violaceous, nontender, and nonindurated rash, is also consistent with SLE. Additionally, the patient's positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) test result and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels support the diagnosis of SLE. While minocycline-induced cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a possible diagnosis, the patient's symptoms and laboratory results do not support this diagnosis as strongly as SLE. Erythema nodosum and sarcoidosis are also possible diagnoses, but they do not explain the patient's full range of symptoms. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is systemic lupus erythematosus.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain and the imaging findings of multiloculated cystic lesions in the liver are consistent with amebic liver abscesses caused by Entamoeba histolytica infection. The patient's history of dull epigastric and right upper quadrant abdominal pain for 1 year suggests a chronic process, which is consistent with the slow-growing nature of amebic liver abscesses. The atypical cells suspicious for malignancy found on percutaneous aspiration biopsy also support this diagnosis, as amebic liver abscesses can have a malignant appearance. The other options, biliary cystadenomas, metastatic cystic neuroendocrine tumors, and cystic hepatocellular carcinomas, can also present with abdominal pain and cystic liver lesions, but are less likely given the patient's history and imaging findings.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's history of radiation therapy to the left breast and axillary basin, as well as the presence of a hard, well-circumscribed, fixed mass in the upper, outer quadrant of her left breast, suggests that the mass is likely a radiation-induced sarcoma. The fact that the mass is distinct from the left breast parenchyma and has possible pleural invasion also supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of synchronous rectal cancer and previous radiation therapy increases the likelihood of a radiation-induced sarcoma. Spindle cell sarcoma is a type of soft tissue sarcoma that can occur in the chest wall, and it is the most likely diagnosis in this case.

Answer: B
Explanation: Given the patient's history of hepatitis B, hepatocellular carcinoma, and idiopathic pancreatitis, it is important to rule out any potential intra-abdominal causes of his symptoms, such as a pancreatic mass or abscess. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest and abdomen would be able to provide information about any potential intra-abdominal causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a pancreatic mass or abscess. Additionally, the patient's symptoms of recurrent abdominal pain and tender nodules on the extremities suggest the possibility of an inflammatory or infectious process that may be visible on CT imaging. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate next step in the patient's evaluation. Option A, obtaining a blood culture, may be appropriate if the patient has signs of sepsis or bacteremia, but it is not the most appropriate next step given the patient's current symptoms and history. Option C, performing an incisional skin biopsy, may be necessary later in the patient's evaluation, but it is not the most appropriate next step at this time.

Answer: C
Explanation:
The patient's symptoms, including the pruritic rash, acneiform papules, postinflammatory hyperpigmentation, and the slowly expanding, hyperpigmented, ringlike lesions with central clearing and peripheral scaling and erythema, are consistent with erythema chronicum migrans (ECM). ECM is a type of cutaneous inflammation that is characterized by the formation of annular or arciform lesions with a tendency towards central clearing and peripheral scaling. The presence of two slowly expanding, hyperpigmented, ringlike lesions with a tendency toward central clearing and peripheral scaling and erythema on the right cheek, as described in the case, is consistent with ECM.

The other options do not fit the patient's symptoms as well. Numular eczema is a type of eczema that is characterized by the formation of discrete, round or oval, scaly patches on the skin. While the patient does have a history of a pruritic rash, the description of the lesions on the right cheek does not fit with numular eczema. Erythema annulare centrifugum is a type of annular erythema that is characterized by the formation of small, round, red patches on the skin that tend to coalesce and form larger annular lesions. The patient's lesions are not consistent with this description. Tinea incognito is a type of tinea that is characterized by the formation of irregular, patchy, scaly lesions on the skin. While the patient does have a history of a pruritic rash, the description of the lesions on the right cheek does not fit with tinea incognito.

The patient's history of ischemic heart disease, familial Mediterranean fever, and arthropathy may also support this diagnosis, as these conditions can be associated with amyloidosis. The patient's recent diagnosis of diabetes mellitus may also be relevant, as amyloidosis can affect the pancreas and lead to insulin deficiency. Glucagonoma (option A) and insulinoma (option B) are both rare pancreatic tumors that can cause hyperglycemia, but they are not typically associated with skin rashes or amyloidosis. VIPoma (option C) is a rare pancreatic tumor that produces vasoactive intestinal peptide and can cause watery diarrhea, but it is not typically associated with skin rashes or amyloidosis.

Answer: C
Explanation: Calcific uremic arteriolopathy (CUA) is a rare complication of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and is characterized by the deposition of calcium in the walls of small muscular arteries, leading to vessel stenosis or occlusion. The patient's history of ESRD, hypertension, and peripheral vascular disease, as well as the presence of calcifications in the skin biopsy specimen, are all consistent with CUA. The patient's symptoms of painful and progressive cutaneous necrosis, muscle weakness, and difficulty ambulating are also consistent with CUA. Additionally, the patient's history of warfarin use increases the risk of CUA.

The other options are less likely diagnoses for this patient's condition:

A. Subacute bacterial endocarditis: The patient does not have any signs of bacterial infection, such as fever or signs of heart failure.

B. Warfarin-induced skin necrosis: While warfarin can cause skin necrosis, it is less likely in this case given the absence of other signs of warfarin toxicity, such as bleeding or bruising.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of exertional leg pain and limited exercise tolerance, along with the physical examination findings of a high-pitched systolic bruit and abnormal ABI, suggest the presence of peripheral artery disease (PAD). The CTA findings of a "beaded appearance" in the right renal artery and long-segment stenosis of the right external iliac artery support this diagnosis. Performing angioplasty and stenting of the right renal and external iliac arteries (Option A) would be the most appropriate next step in managing the patient's symptoms and improving her exercise tolerance. Medical management with antihypertensive agents and a walking program (Option B) may not adequately address the underlying PAD and may not improve the patient's symptoms. Performing angioplasty of the right renal artery and angioplasty with stenting of the right external iliac artery (Option C) may also be considered, but the decision to perform stenting should be based on the severity of the stenosis and the patient's individual circumstances. Administering cilostazol for claudication and continuing lisinopril for hypertension (Option D) may also be considered, but it would not address the underlying PAD and may not improve the patient's exercise tolerance.

Answer: C
Explanation: The clinical presentation of violaceous skin lesions with edema in inguinal and axillary regions, followed by ulceration and infarction, suggests a diagnosis of Ecthyma gangrenosum. This is a rare, severe, and life-threatening skin infection that is often associated with underlying conditions such as immunodeficiency, malignancy, or chronic infections. The patient's history of an unsupervised pregnancy, mother's drug addiction, and hepatitis C virus infection increases the likelihood of an immunocompromised state, which supports this diagnosis. Additionally, the negative serology for syphilis, hepatitis B virus, and HIV types 1 and 2 by ELISA suggests that the infant is unlikely to have these infections, which would also support the diagnosis of Ecthyma gangrenosum. Pyoderma gangrenosum (option A) is a similar condition, but it typically presents with smaller, more superficial ulcers, and is less severe than Ecthyma gangrenosum. Wegener granulomatosis (option C) is a systemic vasculitis that can cause skin lesions, but it is less likely given the patient's age and the absence of respiratory symptoms. Meningococcemia (option D) is a severe bacterial infection that can cause skin lesions, but it is unlikely given the patient's negative blood cultures and the absence of meningitis symptoms.

Answer: C. Internal iliac artery aneurysm
Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of lower back and lower extremity pain, as well as the presence of a firm, nonpulsatile, and slightly tender mass in the left lower quadrant, are consistent with an internal iliac artery aneurysm. The patient's history of hypertension and abdominal aortic aneurysm repair also increase the likelihood of this diagnosis. Additionally, the displacement of the bladder and rectum seen on the computed tomography images suggests that the aneurysm is likely located in the iliac artery.

The other options are less likely given the patient's symptoms and medical history. Prostate cancer (option A) is unlikely given the patient's age and the absence of urinary symptoms such as frequency, urgency, or hesitancy. Recurrent colon cancer (option B) is also unlikely given the patient's history of colon cancer and the absence of symptoms such as abdominal pain, weight loss, or rectal bleeding. Primary lymphoma of the urinary bladder (option D) is a rare condition and is not supported by the patient's symptoms or medical history.

Answer: C
Explanation:
The patient's symptoms of productive cough, profuse hemoptysis, and intermittent breathlessness, along with the chest CT findings of a cavitary lesion with a central contrast-enhanced ball-like mass and an air crescent sign, are consistent with a pulmonary aspergilloma. The patient's history of smoking and the negative results of sputum examinations for acid-fast bacilli smear and culture, fungal culture, and cytology also support this diagnosis. Additionally, the presence of blood clots over the orifice of the left upper lobe bronchus, as revealed by fiberoptic bronchoscopy, is consistent with aspergilloma.

However, the contrast enhancement within the mass and the inability to exclude lung malignancy based on the chest CT finding suggest that other possibilities, such as squamous cell carcinoma (option C), cannot be ruled out entirely. Therefore, option C is the second most likely diagnosis.

Option A, pulmonary tuberculosis, is less likely given the patient's negative sputum examinations for acid-fast bacilli smear and culture, as well as the absence of any endobronchial lesion detected by fiberoptic bronchoscopy.

Option D, pulmonary hydatid cyst, is unlikely based on the patient's symptoms and CT findings, as well as the absence of any history of exposure to dogs or other animals that may carry Echinococcus granulosus, the parasite that causes hydatid disease.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and laboratory results suggest the presence of cerebral vasculitis, an inflammatory condition that affects the blood vessels in the brain. The abnormalities in the intracranial vessels observed on digital subtraction angiography, such as widespread areas of vessel wall irregularity, zones of focal stenosis, and luminal tapering, are consistent with vasculitis. The patient's history of relapsing fevers, night sweats, fatigue, and weight loss also support this diagnosis. Therefore, the appropriate next step would be to initiate treatment for cerebral vasculitis with corticosteroids, which can help reduce inflammation and prevent further damage to the blood vessels in the brain. Initiating secondary preventive treatment for multiple infarctions with antiplatelet agents (Option A) may also be appropriate, but it is not the most urgent step in the patient's management.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a vesiculobullous eruption, which can be caused by a variety of conditions, including infections, autoimmune disorders, and drug reactions. Given the absence of any relevant medical history, travel, or illicit drug use, and the rapid progression of the eruption, a viral etiology is highly suspected. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) are common causes of annular vesiculobullous eruptions. Therefore, it is appropriate to obtain blister fluid culture, Gram stain, and viral polymerase chain reaction assay to confirm the diagnosis. Additionally, obtaining lesional and perilesional skin biopsies for histopathology and direct immunofluorescence stains can help to rule out other potential causes, such as autoimmune bullous dermatoses, and provide further information about the nature of the eruption. Empiric treatment with topical corticosteroids may help to reduce inflammation and pruritus, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of retinal dystrophy, specifically retinal pigment epithelial dystrophy. The presence of yellow-white, multisized, subretinal, creamy lesions clumped in various portions of the retina, including the periphery, and the absence of anterior chamber or vitreous cells, are characteristic features of this condition. A vitreous biopsy would be the most appropriate next step in management, as it would allow for a definitive diagnosis and guide further treatment. Observation (option A) may be appropriate for some cases of retinal dystrophy, but in this case, the patient's symptoms and examination findings suggest a more aggressive approach. Oral corticosteroids (option B) may be used to treat certain types of retinal dystrophy, but they are not indicated in this case.

These include its location on the nasal sidewall, its verrucous texture, and its expansion in size and irritation during puberty. Additionally, the patient's age at presentation and lack of significant medical history are also consistent with this diagnosis. While a congenital melanocytic nevus (option A) could also present with a similar appearance, the patient's history of the lesion being present since birth and its expansion during puberty makes this diagnosis less likely. Epidermal nevus (option B) typically presents as a solitary lesion and is not typically associated with facial location or pubertal changes.

The cystic abnormality seen on both magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and abdominal computed tomography, and the absence of any other medical or surgical history, support this diagnosis. A duplicate gallbladder would not explain the cystic abnormality seen in the imaging results. Biliary cystadenoma is a rare benign tumor that can occur in the biliary tree, but it typically presents with a different imaging appearance and is not associated with symptoms of biliary colic. Hydatid cyst is a parasitic infection caused by Echinococcus granulosus, typically presenting with symptoms of biliary colic, anemia, and elevated liver enzymes, and would not be expected in a 30-year-old female immigrant from Laos.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and clinical findings are consistent with bisphosphonate-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (BRONJ), a rare but potentially severe side effect of bisphosphonate therapy. The exposed bone tissue in the mandible and the mobility of the teeth are characteristic features of BRONJ. The appropriate management of BRONJ involves extraction of the involved teeth and coverage of the exposed bone with a gingival graft to promote healing and prevent further bone exposure. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.

Option B, obtaining radiographs of the mandible, may be useful in evaluating the extent of bone damage, but it is not the most appropriate next step in management.

Option C, prescribing antibiotic treatment and chlorhexidine mouthwashes, may help prevent infection and promote healing, but it does not address the underlying cause of the problem.

Option D, removing the whole section of the mandibular bone, including the involved teeth, may be considered in severe cases of BRONJ that do not respond to conservative management, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient's sudden-onset, painless blurred vision in one eye, along with the physical examination findings of a relative afferent pupillary defect and abnormal fundus examination, suggest the possibility of a posterior circulation stroke or other intracranial pathology affecting the visual pathway. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits would be the most appropriate next step to evaluate the patient's symptoms and determine the underlying cause of her vision loss. This would help to identify any structural abnormalities in the brain or orbit that may be contributing to her symptoms, such as a tumor, aneurysm, or stroke. The other options, such as using antibiotics or steroids, would not be appropriate for this patient's symptoms and are not supported by the clinical findings. Serologic tests may be considered later in the evaluation, but MRI is the most urgent and appropriate next step.

Explanation: A nasal encephalocele is a rare congenital malformation that protrudes from the nasal cavity. It is a herniation of the meninges, cerebrospinal fluid, and sometimes brain tissue through a defect in the skull or nasal cavity. The trunklike projection in this case, with a thin pedicle and mucus discharge, is consistent with a nasal encephalocele. The absence of other craniofacial anomalies and the normal bilateral nasal cavities also support this diagnosis. Supernumerary nostril (A) is an extra nostril, which is not the case here. Proboscis lateralis (C) is a rare congenital malformation where a proboscis-like structure protrudes from the lateral aspect of the nose, which is not present in this case. Cerebro-oculo-nasal syndrome (D) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by craniofacial, ocular, and nasal abnormalities, which is not consistent with the patient's presentation.

Explanation: A mesenteric cyst is a rare abdominal tumor that can be difficult to diagnose. It is a benign tumor that originates from the remnants of the embryonic mesentery. Mesenteric cysts are usually asymptomatic, but they can cause abdominal pain, distension, or palpable masses if they become large enough. The patient's symptoms and the CT scan findings are consistent with a mesenteric cyst. The patient's history of a previous cesarean section may also be relevant, as mesenteric cysts are more common in women, especially those who have had abdominal surgery. While the other options could also be possible diagnoses, the patient's age and lack of other symptoms make mesenteric cyst the most likely diagnosis.

Answer: C 
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of early satiety and heat intolerance, along with the physical examination findings of orthostatic hypotension and an immobile, nontender abdominal mass, suggest a possible pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (PNET). PNETs are known to cause these symptoms due to the excessive secretion of hormones such as insulin, gastrin, and glucagon. The abdominal mass seen on the computed tomographic scan and the specimen after resection (Figure, B) also support this diagnosis. Additionally, cystic neoplasms of the pancreas are relatively rare, and the patient's age and symptoms do not fit the typical presentation for this diagnosis. Lymphoma, pheochromocytoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma are all possible diagnoses for abdominal masses, but they do not fit the patient's symptoms and physical examination findings as well as a PNET does. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is C: Cystic neoplasm of the pancreas.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's history of a puncture wound and the presence of petechiae on the plaque suggest that the lesion may be a result of an infection. The irregular shape and elevated, infiltrative appearance of the plaque also suggest that it may be a form of skin cancer, such as squamous cell carcinoma. A biopsy would be the most appropriate next step to determine the diagnosis and guide further treatment. Treating the lesion with a stronger topical steroid (option D) may not be effective in removing the lesion and could potentially mask the diagnosis. Completely excise the lesion (option A) may be necessary if the biopsy confirms a diagnosis of skin cancer, but it is not the most appropriate next step without first obtaining a diagnosis. Performing dermatologic ultrasonography (option C) may be useful in some cases, but it is not as definitive as a biopsy in determining the diagnosis of a suspicious skin lesion.

Answer: A
Explanation: The patient has a history of a fall and a large hematoma on his right thigh and buttock, which suggests that he may have had a bleeding disorder. The patient's WBC count is elevated to 29,000 cells/μL without a left shift, and his serum hemoglobin level is 9.3 g/dL, which suggests that he may have had blood loss. The patient's symptoms of fevers and night sweats, along with the elevated WBC count, suggest that he may have an infection. The patient's chest radiograph is unrevealing, which suggests that the infection may not be in the lungs. The patient's abdominal examination is unremarkable, which suggests that the infection may not be in the abdomen. The patient's CT scan reveals an abnormal gallbladder finding, which suggests that the infection may be in the gallbladder. Therefore, the best course of action would be to broaden coverage with intravenous antibiotics and proceed with cholecystectomy. This will allow for the removal of the infected gallbladder and the administration of antibiotics to treat the infection.

Answer: C: Linear IgA dermatosis.
Explanation:
Linear IgA dermatosis (LAD) is a rare autoimmune skin condition characterized by the deposition of IgA antibodies along the basement membrane zone (BMZ) of the skin, leading to the formation of blisters and bullae. The clinical presentation of LAD typically includes tense bullae filled with clear fluid, as seen in the patient's case, and an erythematous base. The distribution of the lesions on the trunk, upper limbs, and vulva, as well as the presence of rosette-like blisters, are also consistent with LAD.

The patient's history of a suspected superficial skin infection and the use of antibiotics suggest that the patient may have had a bacterial infection that triggered the onset of LAD. The negative results for anti-transglutaminase and antiendomysial antibodies, which are commonly seen in celiac disease and dermatitis herpetiformis, support the diagnosis of LAD.

Herpetiform dermatitis (A) is a chronic, relapsing skin condition characterized by small, intensely pruritic vesicles and papules, often arranged in a herpetiform pattern. While herpetiform dermatitis can have a similar appearance to LAD, the distribution and size of the lesions are typically different.

Pemphigus (B) is a group of autoimmune blistering disorders characterized by the formation of large, painful blisters and erosions on the skin and mucous membranes. While pemphigus can also present with tense bullae, the distribution and size of the lesions are typically different, and the presence of mucous membrane involvement and scarring is not typical of LAD.

Erythema multiforme (D) is an acute, self-limited skin condition characterized by the formation of small, round, red papules that may coalesce to form larger plaques. While erythema multiforme can have a similar appearance to LAD, the distribution and size of the lesions are typically different, and the condition is usually triggered by a viral or bacterial infection.

Answer: C 
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of severe abdominal pain, distended abdomen, and diffused peritoneal signs are consistent with a spontaneous rupture of the spleen. The patient's recent history of a viral illness and absence of trauma suggest that the rupture was likely caused by a viral infection. The ultrasonography image shows a heterogeneous, hypoechoic lesion in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen, which is consistent with a splenic rupture. The patient's left shoulder pain may be due to referred pain from the splenic rupture. The other options, splenic artery aneurysm rupture, Non-Hodgkin lymphoma with associated hepatosplenomegaly, and pancreatitis with fluid collection, do not fit the patient's symptoms and ultrasonography findings.

Answer: B
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, physical examination findings, and imaging results are consistent with acute appendiceal diverticulitis. The Blumberg sign, which is a clinical sign of appendiceal inflammation, is positive. The ultrasonographic and computed tomographic images show a thickened wall outpouching arising from a discreetly thickened appendix and inflamed surrounding fat, which is consistent with acute appendiceal diverticulitis. The presence of right-sided colonic diverticulosis also supports this diagnosis.

The other options do not accurately reflect the patient's symptoms and imaging findings. Option A, acute appendicitis with colon diverticula, does not take into account the presence of the diverticulitis. Option C, appendiceal diverticulum, refers to a congenital outpouching of the appendix, which is not consistent with the patient's symptoms or imaging findings. Option D, appendiceal mucocele, refers to a rare condition where the appendix becomes filled with mucin, which is not supported by the patient's symptoms or imaging findings.

Answer: D: Perform a biopsy of a skin lesion for pathologic evaluation.
Explanation: The patient's presentation of painful leg ulcerations and necrotic black eschars on the lower extremities, along with a history of ovarian cancer and recent chemotherapy, suggests a possible diagnosis of warfarin-induced skin necrosis. Warfarin is a common chemotherapy drug used to treat various types of cancer, including ovarian cancer. However, it can cause a rare but potentially life-threatening side effect called warfarin-induced skin necrosis, which is characterized by necrotic skin lesions and purpuric patches.

The patient's laboratory results, specifically the elevated creatinine level and slightly elevated lupus anticoagulant level, support the diagnosis of warfarin-induced skin necrosis. The patient's history of recent chemotherapy and the presence of necrotic skin lesions also suggest a possible drug-related cause.

Therefore, the next step would be to perform a biopsy of a skin lesion for pathologic evaluation to confirm the diagnosis of warfarin-induced skin necrosis. This will help guide further management and treatment decisions.

The other options are not as relevant to the patient's presentation and potential diagnosis:

A: Ordering a computed tomography scan of the lower extremities may be useful in evaluating the extent of the skin lesions, but it is not the most appropriate next step in diagnosing the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

B: Ordering a urine toxicology screen to check for cocaine use is not indicated based on the patient's history and presentation, as there is no suspicion of drug use.

C: Ordering an ultrasound of the lower extremities may be useful in evaluating the blood flow to the affected areas, but it is not the most appropriate next step in diagnosing the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of pustules and hair loss on the scalp, accompanied by paronychia, pruritus, and dry skin, suggest a diagnosis of pityriasis simplex. This condition is a common side effect of EGFR inhibitors, such as gefitinib and erlotinib, which the patient has been taking for his lung cancer. Obtaining a bacterial culture from the pustules (option B) would help to rule out any secondary bacterial infections, which could be contributing to the patient's symptoms. It is important to note that a KOH preparation was already performed and yielded negative results, making fungal infections less likely. Therefore, option B is the most appropriate choice.

It is important to confirm the diagnosis with a skin biopsy to guide management and prevent complications. Option C is the best choice because it allows for a definitive diagnosis and appropriate treatment. Option A is not appropriate as broad-spectrum antibiotics would not be effective against a viral infection.

The patient's presentation of acute bilateral angle closure glaucoma (ABACG) is unusual in a 30-year-old woman with a history of migraine headaches and no previous history of corrective lens wear. The discontinuation of a medication for migraine headaches raises the possibility of a medication-related cause for the ABACG. It is important to obtain a detailed list of the patient's medications to identify any potential culprits. A miotic agent (pilocarpine) may be used to treat ABACG, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case. Choroidal drainage sclerotomy and laser peripheral iridotomy are surgical procedures that may be considered in the management of ABACG, but they are not the most appropriate next steps in this case either.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms, such as the multiple tiny, spiny, follicular hyperkeratotic papules on the face, and the abnormal maturation of anagen hair follicles with excessive inner root sheath differentiation, are consistent with the diagnosis of virus-associated trichodysplasia spinulosa (VATS). VATS is a rare condition that is associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. The patient's history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and exposure to immunosuppressive chemotherapy may have increased his risk of developing this condition. Keratosis pilaris (A) is a common skin condition characterized by rough, dry skin and small bumps on the skin, but it does not match the patient's symptoms. Filiform verrucae (B) are small, rough bumps that can occur on the skin, but they are usually not associated with HPV infection.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings, along with the abnormal CT scan, suggest that he may have acute appendicitis. The presence of bilateral lower abdominal tenderness and supraumbilical tenderness, as well as lower abdominal guarding, are consistent with appendicitis. The negative Rovsing sign and negative obturator sign help to rule out other possible causes of abdominal pain, such as a hernia or inflammation of the intestine. The positive psoas sign, which indicates pain in the right lower quadrant with dorsiflexion of the right thigh, is also consistent with appendicitis. Additionally, the patient's leukocytosis and elevated heart rate are consistent with an inflammatory process. Given these findings, it would be appropriate to perform a laparoscopic appendectomy to confirm the diagnosis and treat the appendicitis. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with a possible hernia. The absence of fever or chills and the lack of any mass or accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity on CT scan suggest that the bulge is unlikely to be caused by an acute hernia or other emergency. Given the patient's history of hypertension and diabetes, it would be reasonable to proceed with expectant treatment over the next few months, monitoring the patient's symptoms and performing further diagnostic tests as needed. Emergency laparoscopy (Option A) would not be necessary in this case, as there is no evidence of an acute emergency. Oral acyclovir (Option C) would not be effective in treating a hernia.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient presents with a persistent dry cough, which suggests that the foreign body may be causing irritation or obstruction of the airways. The location of the foreign body in the right side of the chest, as revealed by the CT scan, suggests that it may be causing damage to the lung tissue or airways. Performing a thoracotomy to remove the foreign body would be the most appropriate next step in managing this patient's condition, as it would allow for direct visualization and removal of the foreign body, and potentially prevent further damage to the lung tissue or airways.

Locally exploring the mandibular wound (option A) may be necessary at some point, but it is not the most appropriate next step given the patient's symptoms and the location of the foreign body. Performing angiography (option B) may be necessary to evaluate the blood vessels in the area, but it is not the most appropriate next step given the patient's symptoms and the location of the foreign body.

Answer: C
Explanation: This patient's symptoms of "lines across my vision" and photopsias, along with the physical examination findings of a clear vitreous and the lesion shown in Figure 1, are consistent with a retinal migraine. Retinal migraines are caused by inflammation in the retina, which can be triggered by a variety of factors, including infections. Ancylostoma caninum and Baylisascaris procyonis are parasites that can cause retinal migraines, so it would be appropriate to order urgent serum titers to rule out an infection with one of these parasites.

It is not appropriate to perform a pars plana vitrectomy (option A) at this time, as there is no indication of a vitreoretinal disorder that would require surgical intervention. Systemic antihelmintic therapy (option B) may be necessary if an infection is confirmed, but it would be premature to initiate treatment without first confirming the diagnosis. Photocoagulation (option D) is not a suitable treatment for retinal migraines.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms and physical examination findings are consistent with staphylococcal pustulosis. The presence of pink papulovesicles with hemorrhagic crust on the patient's trunk and extremities, as well as the mild leukopenia and slightly elevated C-reactive protein, are all consistent with this diagnosis. Additionally, the patient's history of recent travel and the presence of a skin rash suggest that the patient may have been exposed to Staphylococcus aureus, which can cause staphylococcal pustulosis. The fact that the patient's vaccinations were up to date and that there were no sick contacts or pets in the household also support this diagnosis.

Disseminated herpes simplex (option A) is unlikely because the patient does not have the characteristic vesicular lesions of herpes simplex and the rash is not widespread. Primary varicella (option B) is also unlikely because the patient has already had chickenpox and the rash is not consistent with varicella. Rickettsialpox (option D) is unlikely because the patient does not have a history of exposure to ticks or other vectors that transmit rickettsial infections, and the rash is not consistent with rickettsialpox.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of fever, nausea, and arthralgias, along with the laboratory results of a white blood cell count of 2700/μL and a lactic acid level of 19.8 mg/dL, suggest a severe infection. The urinalysis showing trace blood, positive nitrite, +1 leukocyte esterase, and a white blood cell count of 2000/μL to 5000/μL, along with a positive urine culture for Klebsiella pneumonia, suggest a urinary tract infection (UTI). The blood culture being positive for Enterobacter sakazakii (now known as Cronobacter sakazakii) suggests that the infection is not only limited to the urinary tract but has also spread to the bloodstream, making it a sepsis. The patient's history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, myelodysplastic syndrome, and Behçet syndrome, along with the use of immunosuppressive medications, may have contributed to the severity of the infection. The patient's surgical history of a previous right-sided hemicolectomy due to recurrent right-sided diverticulitis increases the likelihood of a bowel obstruction or fistula. The computed tomographic scan of the abdomen/pelvis with contrast (Figure 1) shows a possible fistula between the gallbladder and the colon, which could be the source of the bacteremia and sepsis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a cholecystocolonic fistula (option C).

Explanation: The patient's symptoms of abdominal distension and dragging discomfort, along with the irregular mass found on abdominal examination, suggest a possible gastrointestinal tumor. The absence of tenderness and bruit on auscultation, as well as the lack of any other vascular anomalies on systemic examination, make a vascular tumor such as a hemangioma less likely. The patient's age also makes it less likely for a neurilemmoma. A gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a possible diagnosis, as it can present with non-specific symptoms and can arise from the stomach, as suggested by the nonenhanced computed tomography of the abdomen.

Answer: C
Explanation: The patient's symptoms of postprandial chest pain and odynophagia, along with the findings of food stasis throughout the esophagus, large diverticula in the lower esophagus, and extensive candidiasis, suggest a diagnosis of esophageal motility disorder, specifically achalasia. The patient's history of lumbar spine surgery and chronic back pain leading to continued requirement for opiate analgesia may also be relevant to the patient's overall health and potential treatment plan, but they do not directly relate to the likely diagnosis of achalasia.

Esophageal manometry demonstrated 100% hypertensive propagated pressure waves in the distal esophagus, with a mean esophageal pressure of 335 mm Hg, a maximum pressure of 701 mm Hg, and normal relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter. These findings are consistent with achalasia and suggest that the patient's symptoms are caused by a lack of coordinated muscular contractions in the esophagus, leading to food stasis and discomfort.

Given the patient's severe symptoms and weight loss, it is appropriate to consider surgical interventions. Recommending an extended esophageal myotomy (option C) would be a reasonable next step in the patient's management, as it has been shown to improve symptoms and quality of life in patients with achalasia.

While treating the patient with analgesia and nutritional support (option A) may provide some temporary relief, it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Treating with calcium channel antagonists (option B) may also provide some symptomatic relief, but it is not a definitive treatment for achalasia. Esophageal resection (option D) may be considered in some cases of achalasia, but it is a more invasive procedure that may not be necessary in this patient's case, given the severity of their symptoms and the likely diagnosis. Therefore, option C is the most appropriate answer.

The clinical presentation of disseminated, nonpruritic, nonpainful papules and nodules on the face, scalp, ears, neck, trunk, shoulders, upper extremities, lower extremities, including the palms and soles, and scrotum, with sparing of the mucous membranes and periorbital area, suggests a diagnosis of cutaneous lymphoma. The shave biopsy revealing a yellow appearance of the base of the papule and the presence of foamy histiocytoid cells on hematoxylin-eosin staining support this diagnosis. Immunohistochemical testing can help to confirm the diagnosis and differentiate between various types of cutaneous lymphoma. It can also help to identify any associated immunophenotypes, which can guide further management. Therefore, the next step would be to perform immunohistochemical testing on the skin biopsy specimen.

The patient's young age and the absence of a family history of hyperparathyroidism support this diagnosis. The presence of soft tissue extension from the tibia also suggests this diagnosis. The histopathological findings of spindle cell infiltrates with hemorrhages, fragmented trabecular bone, and numerous osteoclastic giant cells proliferating at a rate of 10% are also consistent with this diagnosis. The additional lesions found in the left distal femur and left mandible support the diagnosis of primary hyperparathyroidism with multiple brown tumors. Therefore, option C is the correct answer.
