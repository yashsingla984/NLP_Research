These foreign bodies could be a choking hazard, so it is important to remove them as soon as possible. The best way to remove foreign bodies from the stomach is with endoscopy. Endoscopy is a procedure in which a doctor uses a thin, flexible tube with a camera to view the inside of the stomach. The doctor can then use the tube to remove the foreign bodies.

The patient is a healthy teenager who presented with high-grade fever, neck pain, and a foreign body sensation in the throat after eating chicken 3 days prior. Laboratory investigations demonstrated an elevated leukocyte count. Lateral soft tissue radiography showed a radio-opaque foreign body at the level of C6. Computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed a 2-cm radio-opaque osseous foreign body at the level of the cricopharyngeus muscle with signs of esophageal perforation, including air leak tracking toward the left lobe of the thyroid gland. The patient was brought to the operating room, and the esophageal foreign body was successfully removed. Postoperatively, the patient continued to become febrile despite intravenous antibiotic therapy. A repeated CT scan of the neck and chest was done, which showed gas in the thyroid gland.

These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of emphysematous thyroiditis. Emphysematous thyroiditis is a rare, but serious, infection of the thyroid gland that is caused by gas-forming bacteria. It is often associated with esophageal perforation, as in this case. The diagnosis of emphysematous thyroiditis is made based on clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. Treatment includes antibiotics, surgical drainage, and, in some cases, thyroidectomy.

The patient is a man in his 30s with AIDS who presented with acute-onset painful scattered umbilicated papulopustules and ovoid ulcerated plaques with elevated, pink borders on the face, trunk, and extremities. He also had a new-onset cough but was afebrile and denied other systemic symptoms. Due to his significant immunocompromise, the clinical presentation was highly suspicious for infection.

A Tzanck smear was performed, which is a rapid bedside test that can be used to diagnose herpes simplex virus (HSV). The smear showed ballooning of keratinocytes and peripheralization of nuclear material, which are characteristic findings of HSV infection.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is herpes simplex virus.

The patient has a history of bladder carcinoma and is currently receiving chemotherapy. He presents with fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, and a recent increase in his white blood cell count with a small number of blasts. The differential diagnosis includes acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), and a leukemoid reaction. A bone marrow biopsy is the most definitive test to distinguish between these possibilities.

Answer:
A. Perform a bone marrow biopsy.

The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings are concerning for AML. A bone marrow biopsy is the most definitive test to make the diagnosis and assess the extent of the disease. The results of the bone marrow biopsy will guide further management, which may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or stem cell transplantation.

  0%|          | 4/1525 [00:42<4:58:42, 11.78s/it]The correct answer is C: Perineural spread of cutaneous malignancy.

The patient's history is significant for a left cheek melanoma completely excised years prior, numerous cutaneous squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the bilateral head and neck removed without issue, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. His medications included metformin and simvastatin; he had no history of smoking or drinking.

On examination, he had right-sided ptosis and severe right facial weakness in a lower motor neuron pattern with temporal wasting. The right pupil was fixed and dilated. There was no afferent pupillary defect. The left pupil was appropriately sized and reactive. His right-sided vision was impaired (20/250) with blurriness. Vertical and horizontal binocular diplopia was present. Right extraocular movements were significantly limited in all directions and painful, and right-sided facial sensation was diminished to pinprick in all cranial nerve (CN) V distributions. His speech was slightly slurred. Left-sided extraocular movements were intact. His left facial sensation was intact to pinprick, and his strength was without deficit. There were no other neurological abnormalities.

Initial magnetic resonance images (MRIs) were unremarkable. A biopsy of CN VII was nondiagnostic. Hemoglobin A1c was 6.8%. Tests for infection and autoimmune disease had negative results. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) studies showed mildly elevated protein values.

The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with perineural spread of cutaneous malignancy. The most common malignancy to spread in this way is melanoma. The patient's history of a left cheek melanoma is a strong risk factor for perineural spread. The patient's MRI findings are also consistent with perineural spread of malignancy, as they show enhancement of the right facial nerve. The biopsy of CN VII was nondiagnostic, but this is not uncommon in cases of perineural spread of malignancy. The CSF studies showed mildly elevated protein values, which is another non-specific finding that can be seen in cases of perineural spread of malignancy.

In conclusion, the patient's clinical presentation, history, and imaging findings are most consistent with perineural spread of cutaneous malignancy. The most likely malignancy to spread in this way is melanoma.

The patient is a 31-year-old man with a history of intermittent itching and night sweats for 2 years. He presented with left cervical and left inguinal masses. He denied fever, weight loss, shortness of breath, rashes, diarrhea, and neurological symptoms. On a preemployment evaluation, the patient was told he had a high white blood cell count 2 years ago. On examination, there was left cervical and inguinal lymphadenopathy and no other organomegaly. Complete blood cell count and peripheral blood smear showed marked leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count of 22 340/μL, an absolute neutrophil count of 5360/μL, and 55% eosinophils with an absolute eosinophil count of 12 290/μL (to convert all to cells ×109/L, multiply by 0.001). Vitamin B12 was markedly elevated at more than 4000 pg/mL (to convert to pmol/L, multiply by 0.7378). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 5 mm/h. Lactate dehydrogenase was 180 U/L, and alkaline phosphatase was 81 U/L (to convert both to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167). Evaluations for HIV and hepatitis B and C were all negative. Serum creatinine was 0.76 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4); alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase were 11 U/L and 9.9 U/L, respectively (to convert to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167); and total bilirubin was 0.35 mg/dL (to convert to μmol/L, multiply by 17.104). Bone marrow biopsy showed hypercellular marrow (cellularity of 100%), myeloid hyperplasia, increased eosinophils with some dysplasia, and a blast count of 2%. Positron emission tomographic–computed tomographic scan showed a left upper cervical lymph node of 2.6 cm and a left inguinal lymph node of 3.1 × 2.3 cm with an standardized uptake value max of 5.7 (Figure, A). Left inguinal lymph node biopsy showed partial involvement by atypical cells with high proliferation index (Ki-67 >95%) that were positive for CD3, CD4, CD8, BCL2, and TDT, suggestive of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia (Figure, B).

The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings are consistent with a diagnosis of myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene fusions. These neoplasms are characterized by the presence of eosinophilia and a fusion gene involving the FIP1L1 gene on chromosome 12 and the PDGFRA gene on chromosome 4. The fusion gene leads to the production of a constitutively active tyrosine kinase that drives the proliferation of myeloid and lymphoid cells.

The treatment of myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene fusions typically involves chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy. Chemotherapy is used to kill the cancer cells, while targeted therapy is used to block the activity of the fusion gene. The prognosis for patients with these neoplasms varies depending on the stage of the disease and the response to treatment.

She denied recent travel, sick contacts, or autoimmune disease. Her medical history was significant for α-thalassemia but otherwise noncontributory. On examination, she had tender lymphadenopathy involving right level V. A computed tomography scan of the neck revealed a collection of enlarged, matted nodes without evidence of an abscess. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy showed nondiagnostic reactive lymph nodes. She was subsequently admitted to the hospital, where the lymphadenopathy progressed to the left side of the neck and a skin eruption developed over her face, back, and trunk. Results of an infectious disease and rheumatological workup, including bone marrow biopsy, were negative. Given her persistent symptoms, the ear, nose, and throat service consulted for excisional biopsy. On pathologic examination, the lymph nodes showed extensive coagulative necrosis, apoptosis, and karyorrhectic debris. Cellular components included histiocytes and dendritic cells, with absent neutrophils and hematoxylin bodies. Well-defined areas of fibrinoid necrosis in paracortical areas (hematoxylin-eosin, original magnification ×20).

The most likely diagnosis is Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease. Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease is a rare, self-limiting inflammatory condition that typically affects young adults. It is characterized by cervical lymphadenopathy, fever, and skin rash. The lymph nodes are typically necrotic and show a characteristic histopathologic appearance. There is no specific treatment, and the disease usually resolves within a few weeks or months.

The other possible diagnoses are lymphoma, systemic lupus erythematosus, and Rosai-Dorfman disease. Lymphoma is a malignant neoplasm of lymphocytes. It can present with lymphadenopathy, fever, and skin rash. However, the lymph nodes in lymphoma are typically not necrotic, and the histopathologic appearance is different from that of Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease. Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease that can present with lymphadenopathy, fever, and skin rash. However, the lymph nodes in systemic lupus erythematosus are typically not necrotic, and the histopathologic appearance is different from that of Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease. Rosai-Dorfman disease is a rare, benign lymphoproliferative disorder that typically affects young adults. It is characterized by lymphadenopathy, fever, and skin rash. The lymph nodes in Rosai-Dorfman disease are typically not necrotic, and the histopathologic appearance is different from that of Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease.

She presents with fever, hemoptysis, and syncopal episodes. Her initial vital signs include a blood pressure of 103/66 mm Hg, heart rate of 190 bpm, and temperature of 38.7 °C. Her electrocardiogram shows monomorphic ventricular tachycardia with a morphology suggesting right ventricular origin. She is treated with intravenous amiodarone hydrochloride and correction of mild hypokalemia. Her arrhythmia terminates shortly thereafter, and her vital signs remain stable. Chest computed tomographic angiography excludes pulmonary embolism but shows pulmonary nodules and mediastinal lymphadenopathy that have progressed compared with her previous computed tomography. An echocardiogram shows severe right ventricular and left ventricular systolic dysfunction with multiple areas of hypokinesis.

The next step in management is to determine the underlying cause of the ventricular tachycardia. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the best test to evaluate the heart for structural abnormalities, such as cardiomyopathy or myocarditis. Electrophysiology study (EPS) is a procedure that can be used to identify the location and mechanism of the arrhythmia. Genetic testing may be helpful in patients with a family history of arrhythmias or sudden cardiac death. However, in this patient, the most likely cause of the ventricular tachycardia is her underlying cardiac disease. Therefore, the next step in management is to perform cardiac MRI.

The patient is a 27-year-old woman with a history of a slowly growing left scalp mass. The mass is described as being ill-defined, spongy, and pulsatile. On MRI, the mass is seen to be ill-defined, diffuse, and intensely enhancing. There is also prominent vascularity and underlying calvarial thickening. No osseous destruction or intracranial extension is present. Catheter angiography confirms the hypervascular nature of the mass. The biopsy shows an ill-defined deep dermal/subcutaneous proliferation of spindle cells. The lesions stain positive for S100 and SOX10 immunostains.

The most likely diagnosis is diffuse-type neurofibroma. Diffuse-type neurofibromas are benign tumors of the peripheral nervous system. They are characterized by a proliferation of Schwann cells and fibroblasts. Diffuse-type neurofibromas are often associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). NF1 is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of multiple neurofibromas, café-au-lait spots, and Lisch nodules.

The clinical features of this patient are consistent with a diffuse-type neurofibroma. The patient is a young woman with a history of a slowly growing left scalp mass. The mass is described as being ill-defined, spongy, and pulsatile. These findings are typical of diffuse-type neurofibromas. The MRI findings are also consistent with a diffuse-type neurofibroma. The mass is seen to be ill-defined, diffuse, and intensely enhancing. There is also prominent vascularity and underlying calvarial thickening.

The patient in this case has a chronic, progressive, destructive skin disease with involvement of the upper respiratory tract. The lesions started as an erythematous papule on the face, which had progressed to larger plaques within 10 years. There was involvement of the upper respiratory tract, causing palatal perforation and stridor, necessitating a tracheostomy a year ago. In addition, there was history of wheezing and breathlessness. There was no history of preceding trauma, fever, malaise, joint pain, cough, epistaxis, hemoptysis, or hematuria.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of chromoblastomycosis. Chromoblastomycosis is a chronic, granulomatous fungal infection caused by dematiaceous fungi (fungi that contain melanin in their cell walls). The most common species of fungi that cause chromoblastomycosis are Fonsecaea pedrosoi, Phialophora verrucosa, and Cladophialophora carrionii.

Chromoblastomycosis is typically acquired through traumatic inoculation of the skin with contaminated soil or wood. The initial lesion is usually a small, papular or nodular lesion that slowly enlarges over time. The lesions are often verrucous (wart-like) and may be associated with central ulceration. As the disease progresses, the lesions may become confluent and form large, destructive plaques.

The diagnosis of chromoblastomycosis is based on the clinical presentation, histopathologic findings, and culture results. The histopathologic findings of chromoblastomycosis are characteristic and include the presence of large, pigmented, spherical cells known as "spherules". The spherules are typically surrounded by a palisade of macrophages.

Chromoblastomycosis is treated with a combination of antifungal medications, such as itraconazole or fluconazole. The treatment is often prolonged and may require lifelong therapy.

The patient is a 64-year-old man with a 2-year history of seizure disorder who presented to the emergency department with breakthrough seizures. One month prior to his ED visit, he had been treated with oral antibiotics when he presented to an urgent care center with left-sided otorrhea, otalgia, and hearing loss. In the ED, he denied headaches, fever, otalgia, otorrhea, or hearing loss. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain with contrast showed diffuse enhancement and possible coalescence in the left mastoid process with adjacent dural enhancement and sigmoid sinus occlusion. He received intravenous vancomycin and cefepime and was started on a heparin drip before being transferred to our facility. On presentation at our facility, the patient appeared well with normal vital signs. There was no periauricular swelling or erythema. Otoscopic examination showed no inflammation of the external auditory canals, and the tympanic membranes were translucent without evidence of retraction or effusion. Computed tomographic venogram confirmed occlusion of the left transverse and sigmoid sinuses, and computed tomography of the temporal bone showed coalescence of mastoid air cells with erosion into the sigmoid sinus. Mastoidectomy was performed for biopsy and culture specimens. Histologic findings from the specimens demonstrated cells with oval nuclei and abundant cytoplasm arranged in syncytial clusters with occasional whorls, pseudoinclusions, and psammomatous calcifications (Figure, A). Immunohistochemical stains were positive for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and vimentin (Figure, B).

The most likely diagnosis is acute coalescent mastoiditis with sigmoid sinus thrombosis. The patient's history of otorrhea, otalgia, and hearing loss suggests a middle ear infection. The presence of mastoiditis on imaging studies confirms the diagnosis. The occlusion of the sigmoid sinus on computed tomographic venogram is a complication of mastoiditis.

The differential diagnosis includes Langerhans cell histiocytosis, meningioma, and cholesteatoma. Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disorder characterized by the proliferation of Langerhans cells, which are a type of white blood cell. Meningioma is a type of brain tumor that arises from the meninges, the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. Cholesteatoma is a benign tumor that arises from the epithelial cells that line the middle ear.

The patient's clinical presentation and imaging studies are most consistent with a diagnosis of acute coalescent mastoiditis with sigmoid sinus thrombosis. The other diagnoses are less likely.

The patient is a 62-year-old man with a history of travel to Guyana, South America. He presents with a 2-week history of midline sore throat without systemic signs, such as fever, myalgia, or rash. A physical examination reveals cobbling, adherent, thick yellow mucus and ulceration of the uvula. Empirical treatment with augmentin and nystatin oral suspension was unsuccessful, with symptoms worsening during the subsequent 2 weeks. Results of laboratory testing for group A Streptococcus, COVID-19, and mononucleosis were negative. A tissue biopsy revealed epithelial hyperplasia with suppurative granulomatous inflammation without evidence of dysplasia or malignancy. There was no evidence of fungal or acid-fast organisms. Tissue culture revealed only normal respiratory flora. Additional treatment with fluconazole, augmentin, doxycycline, omeprazole, prednisone, and bactrim failed to improve symptoms.

The most likely diagnosis is **leishmaniasis**. Leishmaniasis is a parasitic infection caused by protozoa of the genus Leishmania. It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected sandflies. The most common form of leishmaniasis in the Americas is cutaneous leishmaniasis, which affects the skin. The initial lesion is a papule that enlarges and ulcerates. The lesion may heal spontaneously, but it can also progress to chronic disease.

The patient's history of travel to Guyana, South America is a risk factor for leishmaniasis. The physical examination findings of cobbling, adherent, thick yellow mucus and ulceration of the uvula are consistent with leishmaniasis. The laboratory findings of negative results for group A Streptococcus, COVID-19, and mononucleosis are also consistent with leishmaniasis. The tissue biopsy findings of epithelial hyperplasia with suppurative granulomatous inflammation without evidence of dysplasia or malignancy are also consistent with leishmaniasis. The tissue culture findings of only normal respiratory flora are also consistent with leishmaniasis. The failure of additional treatment with fluconazole, augmentin, doxycycline, omeprazole, prednisone, and bactrim to improve symptoms is also consistent with leishmaniasis.

The differential diagnosis for the patient's presentation includes tuberculosis, leprosy, and lethal midline granuloma. However, the patient's history of travel to Guyana, South America and the physical examination findings of cobbling, adherent, thick yellow mucus and ulceration of the uvula are more consistent with leishmaniasis.

The patient is a 33-year-old man with no prior ocular problems who presented to the emergency department with a chief complaint of a “pulling and popping” sensation in his left eye that had occurred the previous night. Ophthalmology was consulted to evaluate for a conjunctival foreign body of the left eye. At the time of the examination, his symptoms had resolved; however, he had a photograph from a cellular phone taken during the episode (Figure 1). The photograph shows an irregular, serpiginous extension from beneath the plica semilunaris toward the corneal limbus with localized conjunctival hyperemia. He reported a similar sensation of movement in his left eye that occurred for 1 night about 5 years ago for which he visited an urgent care center where he was diagnosed with allergic conjunctivitis. He also reported recent swelling of the left side of his face with associated numbness and occasional swelling of his left hand, all of which resolved after a few days. He had immigrated from Nigeria 10 years prior, had not returned since, and was working as a traveling nurse. A slitlamp examination did not reveal any conjunctival hyperemia, foreign bodies, or other abnormalities like those shown in the photograph. His uncorrected visual acuity was 20/20, extraocular movements were full and without pain or abnormal sensation, and intraocular pressure was normal. His dilated fundus examination was unremarkable. A comprehensive blood cell count revealed mild elevation in the relative (but not absolute) eosinophil count (6.9% reference; 6.0% of white blood cells).

The differential diagnosis for a subconjunctival foreign body includes foreign body, allergic conjunctivitis, onchocerciasis, and trichinosis. The history of a similar sensation of movement in the left eye that occurred for 1 night about 5 years ago and the recent swelling of the left side of his face with associated numbness and occasional swelling of his left hand, all of which resolved after a few days, are concerning for onchocerciasis. Onchocerciasis is a parasitic infection caused by the nematode Onchocerca volvulus. It is transmitted by blackflies, which are found in tropical and subtropical regions of Africa, the Americas, and the Arabian Peninsula. The infection can cause skin and eye problems, including conjunctivitis, keratitis, and uveitis.

The next step in the management of this patient is to perform serological testing for onchocerciasis. Serological testing is the most sensitive and specific method for diagnosing onchocerciasis. If the serological test is positive, the patient should be treated with ivermectin. Ivermectin is a drug that kills the adult worms that cause onchocerciasis. The patient should also be treated with topical steroids to reduce the inflammation in his eye.

The patient is a 13-year-old boy with a history of sports-related blunt trauma to the left eye. He presents with an asymptomatic, pigmented iris lesion in the left eye. On examination, his best-corrected visual acuity is 20/20 OU, and intraocular pressures are normal in both eyes. Results of slitlamp examination of the right eye are unremarkable. Slitlamp examination of the left eye reveals a round, pigmented lesion measuring 3 × 3 mm in basal dimension and with gravitational shifting within the anterior chamber fluid with patient head tilt. There was no corneal guttatae or edema. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography depicted the lesion in the anterior chamber angle abutting the corneal endothelium and resting on the iris stroma with no internal fluid level and no solid component. Ultrasound biomicroscopy confirmed the lesion to be cystic with a thickness of 1.6 mm. Dilated fundus examination revealed normal findings in both eyes.

The differential diagnosis for a pigmented iris lesion includes a variety of benign and malignant conditions. The most common benign lesions are nevi, which are melanocytic hamartomas. Other benign lesions include iris cysts, melanocytomas, and choroidal nevi. Malignant lesions include melanoma, uveal metastasis, and lymphoma.

In this case, the patient's history of sports-related blunt trauma to the left eye is concerning for a traumatic iris cyst. Traumatic iris cysts are common and usually benign. They are thought to arise from rupture of iris pigment epithelium cells, which then form a cystic cavity filled with aqueous humor. Traumatic iris cysts are typically asymptomatic and do not require treatment. However, if they are large or cause symptoms, such as blurred vision or eye pain, they may need to be treated with cyst aspiration or laser ablation.

In the patient's case, the pigmented iris lesion is small, asymptomatic, and does not have any features of malignancy on imaging. Therefore, the most appropriate management is to observe the lesion with no additional testing or intervention. The patient should be instructed to return for follow-up in 6 months to assess the size and appearance of the lesion. If the lesion grows or changes in appearance, further evaluation may be necessary.

The patient is a woman in her 60s with long-standing thickening and induration of the legs. She has a history of elephantiasis nostras verrucosa, a chronic infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae. The patient's symptoms include left leg pain, firm skin-colored papules and nodules coalescing to form a large plaque on the anterior aspect of the left lower leg, and diffuse induration and hyperpigmentation of the right lower leg. There is no palpable lymphadenopathy. Laboratory analysis reveals normal complete blood cell count, thyroid function, serum protein electrophoresis, and serum immunofixation. A biopsy of a left leg nodule was performed.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes pretibial myxedema, elephantiasis nostras verrucosa, lobomycosis, and euthyroid pretibial mucinosis. Pretibial myxedema is a localized form of myxedema, a non-inflammatory condition characterized by deposition of glycosaminoglycans in the skin and subcutaneous tissue. It is most commonly seen in women with Graves' disease, a form of hyperthyroidism. Elephantiasis nostras verrucosa is a chronic infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae. It is characterized by thickening and induration of the skin, with the formation of nodules and plaques. Lobomycosis is a chronic fungal infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue caused by the fungus Lobomycosis loboi. It is characterized by the formation of nodules and plaques, with ulceration and scarring.

The patient is an 81-year-old White woman with a history of decreased vision in her left eye for 6 months. She has a history of macular degeneration in both eyes and retinal detachment in the left eye that was treated 35 years previously. She also has a history of cutaneous basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, both treated surgically.

On examination, her visual acuity is 20/50 OD and 20/400 OS. External examination shows posterior-chamber intraocular lenses in both eyes and conjunctival scarring in the left eye from circumferential scleral buckle surgery with no visible extraocular tumor. Fundus evaluation shows macular drusen in the right eye and a pale optic disc with geographic macular atrophy in the left eye, explaining her visual acuity of 20/400 OS. In addition, a shallow circumferential buckle effect and an inferotemporal mass measuring 15.0 × 10.0 mm in basal dimension and 9.1 mm in thickness were seen in the left eye. The mass appeared elevated, amelanotic with overlying retinal vasculature, and with chorioretinal atrophy. No retinal detachment or breaks were seen. By ultrasonography the mass was echolucent. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a T1, T2-hypointense shallow circumferential band in the left eye. In addition, there was an inferotemporal nodular mass in the left eye showing T1 (gadolinium) hypointense, T2-hyperintense features, underlying the encircling buckle, and with adjacent subtle delineation. There was no enhancement with gadolinium.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes choroidal melanoma, choroidal hemangioma, and metastatic carcinoma. Choroidal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy, accounting for approximately 5% of all melanomas. It is most common in patients over the age of 60, and is more common in men than women. The risk factors for choroidal melanoma include fair skin, blue eyes, and a history of cutaneous melanoma. The most common presenting symptom of choroidal melanoma is decreased vision. Other symptoms may include floaters, flashes of light, and pain. The diagnosis of choroidal melanoma is made with fundus examination, ultrasonography, and MRI. Treatment for choroidal melanoma depends on the size, location, and stage of the tumor. Options for treatment include observation, plaque radiotherapy, proton beam therapy, and enucleation.

In this patient, the history of decreased vision in her left eye for 6 months, the presence of an elevated, amelanotic mass in the left eye, and the findings on ultrasonography and MRI are all consistent with the diagnosis of choroidal melanoma. The next step in management is to perform a whole-body positron emission tomography scan (PET scan) to rule out metastatic disease. If the PET scan is negative, then the patient can be offered treatment with plaque radiotherapy or proton beam therapy. If the PET scan is positive, then the patient may be offered enucleation or systemic chemotherapy.

The patient is a woman in her 30s with progressive, multiple itchy erythematous to violaceous papules and plaques localized to the left shin for more than 10 years. On close inspection, milia and a few erosions with partially detached epidermis were identified. There were no abnormalities of the mucous membranes, nails, hair, or teeth. No extracutaneous involvement was observed.

The most likely diagnosis is pretibial pruritic papular dermatitis (PPPD). PPPD is a chronic, pruritic dermatosis that typically affects women in their 30s to 50s. It is characterized by multiple, pruritic, erythematous papules and plaques on the shins. The lesions may be lichenified and may have a collarette of scale. Milia are often present. PPPD is a diagnosis of exclusion, and other conditions such as hypertrophic lichen planus, epidermolysis bullosa pruriginosa, and lichen amyloidosis should be considered in the differential diagnosis.

Histopathologic examination of PPPD typically shows acanthosis, spongiosis, and perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate in the upper dermis. Milia may be present.

The treatment of PPPD is difficult and often unsatisfactory. Topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and antihistamines may be used. In some cases, systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents may be necessary.

The mass was noted at birth and remained proportional in size with the child’s somatic growth, measuring approximately 1 cm in diameter on presentation. This suggests that the mass is a congenital lesion.

The preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) documented the mass to be uniformly solid and well circumscribed without cystic components or flow voids, hypointense on T2, and hyperintense with homogeneous contrast enhancement on T1. This suggests that the mass is a solid tumor.

The head, neck, and general examination findings were otherwise normal with no cervical lymphadenopathy or additional masses. This suggests that the mass is a localized lesion.

Given the history, physical examination, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is a rhabdomyoma. Rhabdomyomas are benign tumors of skeletal muscle that are often present at birth. They are typically small, well-circumscribed, and solid masses that are hypointense on T2-weighted MRI and hyperintense on T1-weighted MRI with homogeneous contrast enhancement.

The current rash is erythematous, papulovesicular, and crusting along the mastectomy incision sites. The skin swab bacterial culture was negative, and the patient's skin findings did not improve with antibiotics. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of contact dermatitis. Contact dermatitis is a type of skin inflammation that occurs when the skin comes into contact with an irritant or allergen. The most common causes of contact dermatitis are topical medications, cosmetics, soaps, and detergents. To confirm the diagnosis of contact dermatitis, a skin biopsy can be performed. The biopsy will show a characteristic pattern of inflammation in the skin. Treatment for contact dermatitis involves avoiding the offending substance and applying topical steroids to the affected area. In some cases, oral steroids may also be necessary.

The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of multiple myeloma complicated by therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia. She was admitted for myeloablative conditioning in preparation for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant. Her course was complicated by severe mucositis, acute kidney injury, and neutropenic fever. During her admission, the patient also developed painful necrotic skin lesions, a nonproductive cough, and altered mental status.

The physical examination findings demonstrated dusky, purpuric, and pink papulonodules, some with overlying eschar, scattered on the scalp, neck, trunk, and extremities. These findings are consistent with disseminated fusariosis.

The laboratory study results revealed a white blood cell count of 150/μL, an absolute neutrophil count of 130/μL, and a platelet count of 19 ×103/μL. These findings are consistent with neutropenia, which is a risk factor for disseminated fusariosis.

The blood culture results were negative. This does not rule out disseminated fusariosis, as blood cultures are often negative in this condition.

The results of a CT scan of the brain showed no acute intracranial hemorrhage, territorial infarction, or mass effect. This does not rule out disseminated fusariosis, as the brain is not a common site of involvement in this condition.

The results of a CT scan of the chest demonstrated multifocal bilateral ground-glass patchy opacities, scattered solid bilateral pulmonary nodules, and a moderately sized pericardial effusion. These findings are consistent with disseminated fusariosis.

A biopsy specimen from a skin nodule on the left lateral thigh was obtained for histopathologic examination and tissue culture, and wet mount preparation of a tissue culture colony was performed. The histopathologic examination revealed septated hyphae and oval microconidia, which are characteristic of Fusarium spp. The wet mount preparation revealed septated hyphae and oval microconidia, which are also characteristic of Fusarium spp.

Reasoning:
* The patient is an elderly man with a history of primary salivary duct carcinoma of the hard palate who has been receiving treatment with oral bicalutamide and radiotherapy.
* The patient presents with a 3-month history of a violaceous plaque with blackish papules and nodules on his left cheek, neck, and chest.
* The lesion is increasing in size and has progressed from his face to anterior chest.
* On clinical examination, a hemorrhagic and erythematous plaque with multiple purpuric-to-blackish infiltrative papules and nodules extending from cheek, lateral neck, to the interclavicular area is found.
* An incisional biopsy from the infiltrative nodule on cheek was performed and submitted for histopathologic analysis.
* Histopathologic examination revealed a poorly differentiated angiosarcoma with epithelioid features.

Radiotherapy-induced epithelioid angiosarcoma is a rare but well-recognized complication of radiotherapy. It is characterized by the development of a rapidly growing, aggressive angiosarcoma in the skin or soft tissues of the head and neck. The lesion is typically violaceous or purplish in color and may be associated with blackish papules and nodules. Radiotherapy-induced epithelioid angiosarcoma is a high-grade malignancy with a poor prognosis. The treatment of choice is surgical excision, followed by radiation therapy and chemotherapy.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely in this case. Kaposi sarcoma is a vascular neoplasm that is most commonly seen in patients with HIV infection. Acquired angiokeratomas are benign vascular tumors that are typically seen on the lower extremities. Carcinoma hemorrhagiectoides is a rare form of carcinoma that is characterized by the presence of large, hemorrhagic areas in the skin.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is radiotherapy-induced epithelioid angiosarcoma.

The patient is a previously healthy 16-year-old girl who presented with a red tumor on her right upper arm that enlarged over 6 months. The lesion initially started as a small cutaneous nodule without obvious triggers that gradually developed and enlarged to form a red-colored tumor with a hard nodule inside. There was no history of local trauma or insect bite. Her personal, past, and family histories were unremarkable.

On physical examination, there was a 6 × 6-cm protuberant, thick-walled, and well-defined red bullalike tumor on the right upper arm, which extended 1 to 3 cm from the epidermal surface. Inside the tumor, a nontender, firm-to-hard nodule was palpated. There was no regional lymphadenopathy, and results of the rest of the physical and systemic examinations were normal. Laboratory examinations of hematologic, biochemical, and urinalysis tests were normal. The tumor was excised completely under local anesthesia, and part of the tissue was sent for pathological examination.

The excisional tumor showed multilocular spaces below the epidermis and a solid tumor present in the deep dermis with a chalky-white cut surface and lobulated appearance. Histological examination revealed basophilic cells and shadow cells as well as dilated lymphatic vessels.

Based on the clinical presentation and the histopathological findings, the most likely diagnosis is bullous pilomatricoma. Bullous pilomatricoma is a rare benign tumor of the hair follicle. It is characterized by the presence of basophilic cells and shadow cells in a multilocular cystic space. The tumor is usually located on the head and neck, but can occur anywhere on the body. It is more common in women than men. The average age of presentation is 30 years old.

The treatment of bullous pilomatricoma is surgical excision. The tumor should be completely excised to prevent recurrence. The prognosis is excellent.

He presents with dysphagia, a 4.54-kg (10-lb) weight loss over 3 months, a cough productive of yellow sputum, dyspnea on exertion, and fatigue. He has been treated for presumed pneumonia with 3 courses of azithromycin over the prior 3 months due to infiltrates on a chest radiograph. He reports no known ill contacts or recent travel outside the US.

On physical examination, he has a maculopapular rash over his neck and chest and bibasilar crackles on lung auscultation. Laboratory testing shows a white blood cell count of 14.3 × 103/μL (reference, 4.2-9.1 × 103/μL); creatine kinase level, 2060 U/L (34.40 μkat/L) (reference, 44-196 U/L [0.73-3.27 μkat/L]), aldolase level, 18 U/L (0.30 μkat/L) (reference, <8 U/L [<0.13 μkat/L]), C-reactive protein level, 30 mg/L (reference, <8 mg/L), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 35 mm/h (reference, <20 mm/h). Antinuclear antibody immunofluorescent assay findings were positive. Results from testing for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C were negative. A barium swallow study showed no visualized aspiration. Endoscopy revealed clean-based esophageal and duodenal ulcers and nonspecific gastritis. Chest computed tomography (CT) showed bibasilar pulmonary consolidations and ground glass opacities.

The patient's presentation is concerning for a systemic autoimmune disease, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE is a chronic, multisystem autoimmune disease that can affect any organ system. The most common symptoms of SLE are fatigue, fever, joint pain, and rash. Other symptoms can include Raynaud phenomenon, dry eyes and mouth, hair loss, and seizures.

The patient's history of gastroesophageal reflux disease and Raynaud disease are both associated with SLE. His dysphagia, weight loss, cough, dyspnea on exertion, and fatigue are all common symptoms of SLE. The infiltrates on his chest radiograph could be due to pneumonia, but they could also be due to pulmonary involvement in SLE. The maculopapular rash on his neck and chest is a characteristic finding of SLE. The elevated white blood cell count, creatine kinase level, aldolase level, C-reactive protein level, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are all non-specific findings that can be seen in SLE. The positive antinuclear antibody test is a serologic marker that is highly sensitive for SLE.

The patient's clinical presentation and laboratory findings are consistent with a diagnosis of SLE. The next step in management is to arrange for a percutaneous lung tissue biopsy. This will allow for a definitive diagnosis of SLE and will help to assess the extent of the disease. The patient should also be started on a course of immunosuppressive therapy, such as prednisone.

Findings of flexible laryngoscopy showed a submucosal mass in the left oropharynx extending inferiorly into the hypopharynx, obliterating the left pyriform sinus, abutting the base of tongue with hooding over the epiglottis. The supraglottis and glottis were unremarkable. Computed tomography imaging with contrast of the neck revealed a 4.6 × 4.0 × 8.0-cm heterogeneously enhancing mass in the left oropharynx and hypopharynx with cystic components and clear planes separating the mass from the spinal musculature and carotid sheath.

The most likely diagnosis is a pediatric fibromyxoid soft tissue tumor (PFTST). PFTST is a rare, benign soft tissue tumor that occurs predominantly in children and young adults. It is typically located in the head and neck region, and can present with symptoms of dysphagia, dyspnea, and neck mass. On imaging, PFTST is a well-circumscribed, heterogeneous mass with cystic components. The differential diagnosis for PFTST includes other benign soft tissue tumors, such as schwannoma, neurofibroma, and lipoma.

The patient is a 46-year-old man with a left shoulder mass that began as a quarter-size maculopapular lesion and progressed over the course of 3 years. He has limited shoulder movements and denies other symptoms. There is no medical or surgical history, and he has a negative personal or familial oncologic history. The patient is a construction worker and uses tobacco daily. On physical examination, there is a 24 × 15-cm fungating, necrotic, and ulcerated left shoulder mass. A punch biopsy shows sheets of highly pleomorphic atypical spindle and epithelial cells within the superficial and deep dermis, extending into the subcutaneous tissue, and with 18 mitoses/mm2. Immunohistochemistry demonstrates SOX10-positive and pankeratin-negative tumor cells. A whole-body positron emission tomographic and computed tomographic scan reveals an intensely hypermetabolic left shoulder mass and multiple hypermetabolic enlarged left axillary lymph nodes, with no distant metastases. Brain magnetic resonance imaging was negative for intracranial metastasis.

The most likely diagnosis is **squamous cell carcinoma**. This is a type of skin cancer that most commonly occurs on sun-exposed areas of the skin, such as the face, neck, hands, and forearms. It is typically a slow-growing cancer, but it can spread to other parts of the body if it is not treated. The most common symptom of squamous cell carcinoma is a raised, red, or scaly lesion on the skin. The lesion may bleed or crust over, and it may become painful. In some cases, the lesion may ulcerate and become infected.

The diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma is made based on a biopsy of the lesion. The biopsy will show the presence of abnormal cells that are characteristic of squamous cell carcinoma. Treatment for squamous cell carcinoma depends on the stage of the cancer. Early-stage squamous cell carcinoma can be treated with surgery, radiation therapy, or a combination of both. More advanced squamous cell carcinoma may require chemotherapy or immunotherapy.

The patient has a history of B-cell lymphoma and active renal cell carcinoma (RCC), receiving cabozantinib therapy. He was referred for worsening hazy vision in the right eye after recent outside retinal detachment (RD) repair of the left eye, with pars plana vitrectomy and gas. The patient noted blurry vision started around the time of cabozantinib therapy initiation. Cabozantinib therapy was discontinued for surgery and resumed 3 days later. The referring retina specialist noted vitritis and vasculitis intraoperatively, but the result of vitreous biopsy cytology was negative for malignant cells.

At presentation to our institution, the patient was taking oral prednisone, 40 mg/d. His visual acuity was 20/500 OD and hand motions OS, with an intraocular pressure of 18 mm Hg in both eyes. Right eye slitlamp examination results showed pigmented cells in the anterior chamber and lens capsule; the left eye showed prolapsed pigmented vitreous at the pupillary margin. Right eye fundus examination results revealed sheets of pigmented cell and vascular sheathing with optic nerve pallor. The left eye had a poor view, with 90% gas fill. Fluorescein angiography illustrated disc and vessel leakage (predominantly arteriole), capillary dropout, and peripheral nonperfusion in the right eye (Figure 1A) with no view in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography revealed debris at the vitreoretinal interface (Figure 1B).

The patient's presentation is consistent with retinal vasculitis secondary to cabozantinib therapy. Cabozantinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is used to treat a variety of cancers, including RCC. It has been associated with a number of ocular side effects, including retinal vasculitis.

The treatment of retinal vasculitis secondary to cabozantinib is typically supportive. This may include stopping the cabozantinib therapy, if possible, and treating the inflammation with corticosteroids. In some cases, other medications, such as cyclophosphamide or azathioprine, may be necessary.

In this case, the patient's visual acuity is poor in both eyes and he has evidence of retinal detachment in the right eye. The best option for treatment is to stop the cabozantinib therapy and admit the patient for intravenous solumedrol. This will help to control the inflammation and may improve the patient's vision.

Reasoning:

The patient has a history of syringomyelia, which is a condition that can cause progressive destruction of bone. The patient also has a recent history of left shoulder pain, stiffness, and reduced range of motion. The physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of avascular necrosis of the left humeral head. Avascular necrosis is a condition in which the blood supply to the bone is disrupted, leading to the death of bone tissue. The MRI scan will provide more information about the extent of the avascular necrosis and help to determine the best course of treatment.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Serum tumor marker testing is not indicated in a patient with avascular necrosis of the humeral head. Orthopedic surgery evaluation for shoulder replacement surgery is a reasonable option, but it is important to obtain more information about the extent of the avascular necrosis before making a decision about surgery. Performing an urgent left shoulder joint aspiration is not indicated in this case.

She is also 11 weeks postpartum, which is a time of increased risk for SCAD. The patient's presentation is consistent with SCAD, with acute pleuritic chest pain, shortness of breath, and nausea. She has tachycardia and hypoxemia, which are signs of hemodynamic instability. Her electrocardiogram shows ST-segment elevation in leads I and aVL, which is suggestive of an acute coronary syndrome. Her initial high-sensitivity troponin is elevated, which further supports the diagnosis of SCAD. Cardiac point-of-care ultrasonography demonstrates a severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, which is consistent with an acute coronary syndrome. Emergent cardiac catheterization revealed SCAD of the left main coronary artery.

SCAD is a rare but life-threatening condition that occurs when a tear in the wall of a coronary artery causes blood to flow into the artery wall and create a false lumen. This can lead to acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, and sudden death. The treatment of SCAD depends on the severity of the dissection and the patient's clinical status. In general, patients with SCAD who are hemodynamically stable can be managed medically with anti-inflammatory and antiplatelet medications. Patients who are hemodynamically unstable or who have evidence of myocardial ischemia should undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG).

In this case, the patient is hemodynamically unstable and has evidence of myocardial ischemia. Therefore, the best management option is emergent PCI. PCI involves inserting a balloon catheter into the affected coronary artery and inflating the balloon to widen the artery and restore blood flow. This is a minimally invasive procedure that can be performed under local anesthesia. After PCI, the patient will be started on anti-inflammatory and antiplatelet medications. She will also be monitored closely for signs of recurrence.

The results of a comprehensive metabolic panel, C3, C4, serum protein electrophoresis, serum free light chains, methylmalonic acid, homocysteine, ferritin, copper, zinc, haptoglobin, HIV, hepatitis B and C serologic tests, and rapid plasma reagin were negative. Lactate dehydrogenase was mildly elevated. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was elevated at 41 mm/h. Routine cancer screening was up to date. Therapeutic trials of dapsone and dapsone in combination with colchicine were not effective.

The most likely diagnosis is drug-induced SCLE. Drug-induced SCLE is a rare, autoimmune skin disorder that is characterized by the development of annular or serpiginous plaques on the skin. The plaques are typically erythematous and edematous, and they may be associated with fever, fatigue, and arthralgias. Drug-induced SCLE can be caused by a variety of medications, including antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and antihypertensives. The diagnosis of drug-induced SCLE is made based on the clinical presentation and the results of a skin biopsy. Treatment of drug-induced SCLE typically involves the discontinuation of the offending medication and the use of topical or systemic corticosteroids.

The other possible diagnoses are all less likely. VEXAS syndrome is a rare, autoimmune disorder that is characterized by the development of annular plaques on the skin, along with fever, fatigue, weight loss, and arthralgias. VEXAS syndrome is thought to be caused by an autoimmune reaction to a variety of triggers, including infection, medications, and stress. The diagnosis of VEXAS syndrome is made based on the clinical presentation and the results of a skin biopsy. Treatment of VEXAS syndrome typically involves the use of systemic corticosteroids. Histiocytoid Sweet syndrome is a rare, inflammatory disorder that is characterized by the development of painful, erythematous plaques on the skin. Histiocytoid Sweet syndrome is thought to be caused by an autoimmune reaction to a variety of triggers, including infection, medications, and stress. The diagnosis of histiocytoid Sweet syndrome is made based on the clinical presentation and the results of a skin biopsy. Treatment of histiocytoid Sweet syndrome typically involves the use of systemic corticosteroids. Halogenoderma is a skin disorder that is caused by exposure to halogens, such as chlorine, bromine, and iodine. Halogenoderma is characterized by the development of erythematous, edematous plaques on the skin. The diagnosis of halogenoderma is made based on the clinical presentation and the results of a skin biopsy. Treatment of halogenoderma typically involves the avoidance of halogens and the use of topical or systemic corticosteroids.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for the patient is drug-induced SCLE.

The patient has a 20-year history of progressive skin laxity, which began in early childhood. She also has yellowish papules scattered on the dorsal neck. The physical examination shows thick and leathery skinfolds on the neck, axillae, inguinal regions, abdomen, and limbs. Coagulation-related tests indicate a low clotting activity of factor X and a prolonged prothrombin time. The results of other laboratory investigations are unremarkable. Echocardiographic and fundoscopic examination results are normal. A skin biopsy specimen was obtained from her neck for histopathologic examination, which showed excessive calcification of elastic fiber fragments scattered in the reticular dermis.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE). PXE is a rare, inherited disorder characterized by progressive skin laxity, vascular fragility, and ocular involvement. The skin changes are caused by calcification of elastic fibers in the dermis. The vascular fragility can lead to easy bruising and bleeding, and the ocular involvement can cause vision problems.

The patient's family history is also consistent with PXE. Her younger sister has developed the same skin symptoms.

The other possible diagnoses are inherited cutis laxa syndrome (ICLS) and pseudoxanthoma elasticum–like disorder with coagulation deficiency. However, ICLS is characterized by generalized skin laxity, joint laxity, and other connective tissue abnormalities. The patient does not have any of these other features. Pseudoxanthoma elasticum–like disorder with coagulation deficiency is a rare disorder characterized by skin laxity, calcification of elastic fibers, and coagulation defects. The patient's coagulation tests are normal, so this diagnosis is less likely.

He has a 1-week history of fever, cough, and lethargy that did not improve after 3 days of oral cefuroxime. His physical examination reveals absent breath sounds on the right hemithorax and a soft, nontender abdomen without hepatosplenomegaly. His laboratory tests show an elevated white blood cell count with eosinophilia. A thoracoabdominal computed tomography (CT) scan shows a ruptured 10 × 9 × 5–cm right upper lobe pulmonary cyst compressing the right main bronchus and 3 liver cysts.

The most likely diagnosis is cystic echinococcosis, which is caused by the larval stage of the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus. This infection is most common in areas where sheep and cattle are raised, such as rural China. The patient's history of close contact with dogs, cattle, and sheep, as well as his clinical presentation, are consistent with cystic echinococcosis.

The next step in management is to confirm the diagnosis with serologic testing for E granulosus antibodies. If the serologic test is positive, the patient should be treated with albendazole or mebendazole. These medications are effective in killing the larvae of E granulosus, but they may take several months to be effective. The patient should also be treated for any complications of cystic echinococcosis, such as lung compression or liver abscess.

These features could be caused by a number of different conditions, including amyloidosis, a rare but serious disease that can affect multiple organs in the body. Amyloidosis is characterized by the deposition of abnormal proteins, called amyloid fibrils, in tissues and organs. This can lead to a variety of problems, including heart failure, neuropathy, and spinal stenosis.

To confirm the diagnosis of amyloidosis, a bone marrow biopsy is typically performed. This procedure involves removing a small sample of bone marrow from the hip bone. The bone marrow is then examined under a microscope to look for amyloid fibrils.

If amyloidosis is diagnosed, treatment will depend on the specific type of amyloidosis and the extent of the disease. Treatment may include medications, chemotherapy, or stem cell transplantation.

The patient is a 64-year-old woman with a 8-month history of diminution of vision, progressive redness, and dull aching pain in the right eye. There is no history of trauma. The patient's medical history is unremarkable. On examination, the patient has a best-corrected visual acuity of 20/60 in the right eye and 20/25 in the left eye. The anterior segment shows dilated corkscrew conjunctival vessels, a shallow anterior chamber in the right eye, and nuclear cataract in both eyes. Pupillary reaction and color vision are normal in both eyes. Intraocular pressure is 16 mm Hg by Goldman applanation tonometry in both eyes. Gonioscopy reveals an occludable angle in the right eye without evidence of blood in the Schlemm canal. Both eyes' extraocular movements are full and free in all directions of gaze. Dilated fundus examination shows a clear vitreous cavity in the right eye, 360° serous choroidal detachment partly obscuring the optic disc nasally, and the fundus in the left eye is unremarkable.

The differential diagnosis for a 360° serous choroidal detachment includes:

* Uveitis: Uveitis is an inflammation of the uveal tract, which is the middle layer of the eye. Uveitis can be caused by a variety of factors, including infection, autoimmune disease, and trauma. Uveitis can cause a variety of symptoms, including redness, pain, and vision loss.
* Choroidal neovascularization: Choroidal neovascularization is the growth of new blood vessels in the choroid, which is the layer of tissue that lies between the retina and the sclera. Choroidal neovascularization can be caused by a variety of factors, including age, hypertension, and diabetes. Choroidal neovascularization can cause a variety of symptoms, including vision loss and bleeding into the vitreous cavity.
* Retinal detachment: Retinal detachment is the separation of the retina from the underlying choroid. Retinal detachment can be caused by a variety of factors, including trauma, age, and myopia. Retinal detachment can cause a variety of symptoms, including flashing lights, floaters, and vision loss.

The next step in the management of this patient is to obtain a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or digital subtraction angiography (DSA). MRI with MRA or DSA is a non-invasive imaging test that can be used to diagnose and assess the severity of choroidal neovascularization. MRI with MRA or DSA can also be used to guide treatment of choroidal neovascularization.

  3%|▎         | 39/1525 [09:21<6:28:04, 15.67s/it]The correct answer is: **A. Perform peripheral iridotomy.**

The patient has a unilateral deepening of the anterior chamber associated with signs of anterior uveitis (ie, keratic precipitates and severe aqueous flare, 3+) and posterior synechiae between the iris and the lens. In addition, fundus examination revealed an inferior retinal detachment without any associated visible tear. The most likely diagnosis is a pupillary block glaucoma.

Pupillary block glaucoma is a type of glaucoma that occurs when the iris blocks the flow of aqueous humor from the posterior chamber to the anterior chamber. This can cause a sudden increase in intraocular pressure, which can damage the optic nerve and lead to vision loss.

The treatment for pupillary block glaucoma is to create a new opening in the iris, called a peripheral iridotomy. This allows aqueous humor to flow from the posterior chamber to the anterior chamber, which lowers intraocular pressure.

In the case of the patient described in the question, the best treatment option is to perform a peripheral iridotomy. This will allow aqueous humor to flow from the posterior chamber to the anterior chamber, which will lower intraocular pressure and prevent further damage to the optic nerve.

The other options are not appropriate for this patient. Option B, perform full-thickness sclerectomy, is a surgical procedure that is used to treat chronic open-angle glaucoma. Option C, administer intravenous corticosteroids, is a treatment for anterior uveitis. Option D, schedule combined phacoemulsification-vitrectomy surgery, is a surgical procedure that is used to treat both cataracts and retinal detachments. However, this patient does not have a cataract, so this option is not necessary.

Therefore, the best treatment option for the patient described in the question is to perform a peripheral iridotomy.

The patient is a 63-year-old man with a history of stage 3 cutaneous melanoma of the scalp and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. He received nivolumab (anti–programmed cell death 1 checkpoint inhibitor) 9 months prior, obinutuzumab (B-cell lymphoma 2 inhibitor) 3 months later, and 5-mg oral prednisone daily. On presentation, nivolumab and obinutuzumab treatment was complete.

His visual acuity was 20/125 OD and 20/50 OS. Ophthalmoscopy revealed bilateral panuveitis with diffuse pigmentary abnormalities. Fluorescein angiography showed diffuse retinal pigment epithelium loss and late staining of the retinal lesions. He received 60 mg of oral prednisone daily for 2 weeks with a planned 10-week taper. However, prednisone was discontinued due to positive Lyme disease exposure 6 weeks later. At this time, the active anterior and vitreous cells had resolved.

However, 2 weeks later, visual acuity decreased to count fingers in his right eye and hand motions in the left eye. The anterior and vitreous chambers had grade +0.5 pigmented cells. The ophthalmoscopic examination showed a leopard-spot pattern (Figure 1), and optical coherence tomography showed substantial retinal pigment epithelium and outer retinal layer loss. Repeat testing for Treponema pallidum, Lyme disease, and HIV was negative. Results of magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbit were negative for leukemic infiltration.

The differential diagnosis for this patient's visual loss includes:

* Ocular histoplasmosis syndrome
* Multifocal choroiditis and panuveitis
* Sarcoidosis
* Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome
* Sympathetic ophthalmia
* Leukemia

The patient's history of melanoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, as well as the presence of bilateral panuveitis with diffuse pigmentary abnormalities and leopard-spot pattern on ophthalmoscopy, are suggestive of leukemia. The leopard-spot pattern is a characteristic finding in posterior uveitis associated with leukemia.

The next step in the management of this patient is to perform a vitreous biopsy with or without chorioretinal biopsy for flow cytometry to assess for leukemic cells. If leukemic cells are found, the patient will need to be treated with systemic chemotherapy.

The lesion is isointense on T1-weighted imaging, is hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging, and demonstrates heterogeneous enhancement following gadolinium administration. A computed tomography–guided fine-needle aspiration was performed, which demonstrated blood, fibrin, and rare mesenchymal cells. Given her ongoing symptoms, the patient requested surgical resection. The patient underwent transoral robotic surgery for resection of her PPS mass to achieve definitive diagnosis and treatment. Histopathologic evaluation demonstrated a well-circumscribed, 12-mm mass.

The most likely diagnosis is a paraganglioma. Paragangliomas are rare, neuroendocrine tumors that arise from paraganglia, which are clusters of cells that are found throughout the body, including the head and neck. Paragangliomas are typically benign, but they can be malignant. The most common symptoms of a paraganglioma are headache, facial pain, and hearing loss.

  3%|▎         | 42/1525 [10:05<6:20:22, 15.39s/it]The correct diagnosis is: A. Maxillary carcinoma with perineural spread.

Reasoning:

* The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of recurrent high-grade serous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary. She developed left-sided facial weakness and swelling for 2 months, after cycle 4 of chemotherapy.
* Physical examination findings were consistent with left lower-motor-neuron type of facial nerve palsy.
* MRI of the brain showed mucosal thickening in both maxillary sinuses, with intermediate to hypointense signal on T2-weighted imaging and hypointense signal on T1-weighted imaging with postcontrast enhancement. Computed tomography sections confirmed bony destruction with foci of remodeling involving the walls of the maxillary sinuses.
* Fat stranding and enhancing soft tissue was seen in the retroantral spaces bilaterally as well as the pterygopalatine fossae. Anteriorly, enhancing soft tissue was present in premaxillary space, from which contiguous linear enhancement was seen extending to left parotid gland—along the expected course of buccal branch of left facial nerve. The entire extracranial left facial nerve proximal to this showed diffuse enhancement and thickening. Associated stylomastoid foramen widening was present with subtle enhancement along its mastoid and tympanic segments. These features were compatible with perineural extension of disease.
* Additionally, there was involvement of the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve via intercommunication between the auriculotemporal branch of trigeminal nerve and the intraparotid facial nerve. Diffuse enhancement and thickening was seen up to the left foramen ovale, without involvement of the trigeminal ganglion.

The most likely diagnosis is maxillary carcinoma with perineural spread. This is supported by the following findings:

* The patient's history of recurrent high-grade serous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary, which is a known risk factor for maxillary carcinoma.
* The patient's presentation with left-sided facial weakness and swelling, which is a classic presentation of perineural spread of maxillary carcinoma.
* The MRI findings of mucosal thickening in both maxillary sinuses, with intermediate to hypointense signal on T2-weighted imaging and hypointense signal on T1-weighted imaging with postcontrast enhancement, which are consistent with perineural spread of maxillary carcinoma.
* The CT findings of bony destruction with foci of remodeling involving the walls of the maxillary sinuses, which are also consistent with perineural spread of maxillary carcinoma.
* The perineural enhancement of the left facial nerve, which is a classic finding of perineural spread of maxillary carcinoma.
* The involvement of the mandibular branch of the trigeminal nerve via intercommunication between the auriculotemporal branch of trigeminal nerve and the intraparotid facial nerve, which is another classic finding of perineural spread of maxillary carcinoma.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely in this case. Schwannoma is a benign tumor that typically arises from the Schwann cells that surround nerve fibers. It is not a common cause of facial nerve palsy, and it does not typically spread to other parts of the body. Invasive fungal sinusitis (mucormycosis) is a rare, life-threatening infection that is caused by fungi of the Mucorales family. It is most commonly seen in patients with diabetes, immunosuppression, or other underlying medical conditions. It is not a common cause of facial nerve palsy, and it does not typically spread to other parts of the body. Metastases from ovarian primary are a possible diagnosis, but they are less likely than maxillary carcinoma with perineural spread in this case. This is because ovarian carcinoma is not a common primary site for metastases to the facial nerve. Additionally, the patient's history of recurrent high-grade serous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary is a risk factor for maxillary carcinoma.

The patient is a man in his late 60s with a 10-year history of multiple myeloma. He recently received the first cycle of a chemotherapeutic regimen of ixazomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone. He presents with a 10-day history of fever up to 38.5 °C and tender lesions on the neck and trunk. Physical examination shows annular erythematous plaques of up to 2 cm in diameter, with violaceous and crusted centers on the neck and trunk. On the right chest, an annular erythematous lesion with 2 zones of color—a central area of purpura and an outer erythematous and edematous ring—was present. Laboratory investigations found pancytopenia: a white blood cell count of 2.3 × 103/μL (reference range, 3.5-9.8 × 103/μL), hemoglobin levels of 12.1 g/dL (reference range, 13.5-17.6 g/dL), platelet count of 29 × 103/μL (reference range, 130-400 × 103μL), and elevated serum C-reactive protein levels of 3.31 mg/dL (reference range, <0.30 mg/dL). Blood culture results were negative. Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor analogs had not been prescribed to the patient. Skin biopsy from a lesion on the left chest was performed for histopathological and immunohistochemical analyses.

The most likely diagnosis is cutaneous involvement of multiple myeloma. This is supported by the patient's history of multiple myeloma, the presence of pancytopenia, and the histopathological findings of an inflammatory infiltrate of predominantly mononuclear cells in the superficial and mid dermis. The immunohistochemical finding of myeloperoxidase-positive cells is also consistent with a diagnosis of cutaneous involvement of multiple myeloma.

The patient is a 6-year-old child with a history of headache for 1 month, seizures, and altered consciousness. He has a blood pressure of 170/110 mm Hg, abdominal bruit, and papilledema. His cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows bilateral white matter hyperintensity that is more marked in the bilateral parieto-occipital region. Ultrasound of the abdomen reveals a small right kidney and renal Doppler was suggestive of right renal-artery stenosis. His computed tomography angiography (CTA) revealed short segment (3 cm) and short circumferential thickening of the descending aorta with right renal artery narrowing. His repeat cranial MRI showed significant reduction in the white matter hyperintensities.

The most likely diagnosis is posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). PRES is a reversible neurological disorder that is characterized by headache, seizures, altered consciousness, and visual disturbances. It is typically caused by a sudden increase in blood pressure, which can lead to vasoconstriction of the cerebral arteries. This vasoconstriction can result in ischemia and infarction of the brain parenchyma.

In this case, the patient's history of headache, seizures, and altered consciousness is consistent with PRES. His blood pressure of 170/110 mm Hg is also consistent with PRES. The abdominal bruit and papilledema are suggestive of renal artery stenosis, which can be a cause of PRES. The cranial MRI shows bilateral white matter hyperintensity that is more marked in the bilateral parieto-occipital region, which is also consistent with PRES. The ultrasound of the abdomen reveals a small right kidney and renal Doppler was suggestive of right renal-artery stenosis, which is further evidence of renal artery stenosis. The CTA revealed short segment (3 cm) and short circumferential thickening of the descending aorta with right renal artery narrowing, which is also consistent with renal artery stenosis. The repeat cranial MRI showed significant reduction in the white matter hyperintensities, which is consistent with the reversibility of PRES.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is PRES.

The patient has black tongue discoloration, which is a common side effect of cefazolin. It is caused by elongation of the filiform papillae on the tongue, which become coated in bacteria and food debris. The discoloration is usually harmless and resolves on its own within a few weeks.

**Answer:**
C. Provide reassurance and prescribe oral care.

The patient should be reassured that the black tongue discoloration is a harmless side effect of cefazolin and that it will resolve on its own within a few weeks. He should be instructed to brush his tongue twice daily and to use an antiseptic mouthwash to help prevent infection.

There is no need to measure serum cortisol level, perform a tongue biopsy, or stop cefazolin. Serum cortisol level is not typically used to monitor patients receiving cefazolin. A tongue biopsy is not necessary to diagnose black tongue discoloration, as it is a well-recognized side effect of the medication. Stopping cefazolin is not necessary, as the discoloration is harmless and will resolve on its own.

Aseptic endophthalmitis can occur after intraocular surgery, trauma, or in the setting of systemic infection. In this case, the patient has a history of AML, which is a cancer of the blood cells. Leukemia can spread to the eye, and can cause aseptic endophthalmitis. The patient's recent chemotherapy may have also suppressed her immune system, making her more susceptible to infection.

The next step in management is to obtain a sample of the hypopyon through anterior chamber paracentesis and inject intravitreal antibiotics. This will help to confirm the diagnosis of aseptic endophthalmitis and to begin treatment. A pars plana vitrectomy is not necessary at this time, as the patient does not have vitreous opacities on B-scan ultrasonography. Observing the patient without treatment is not an option, as this could lead to permanent vision loss.

Prenatal history was complicated by insulin-controlled gestational diabetes and polyhydramnios. Her ocular history is notable for eye movement abnormalities since birth. She has no family history of ocular disease.

On examination, her visual acuity is 20/150 OU and did not improve with correction. Pupillary responses are normal. Alternating vertical and torsional nystagmus is noted. The optic nerve and foveal reflexes are normal in both eyes. Flash visual evoked potential (VEP) demonstrated strong ipsilateral activity of the occipital lobe. Results of a previously obtained brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan were reported as normal.

The most likely diagnosis is Joubert syndrome. Joubert syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by developmental delay, ataxia, hypotonia, and abnormal eye movements. The diagnosis is made based on clinical findings and genetic testing. There is no cure for Joubert syndrome, but treatment can help to manage the symptoms. Treatment may include physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and medication to control seizures.

In this case, the patient has a history of multiple congenital anomalies and developmental delay. She also has abnormal eye movements, which are a characteristic feature of Joubert syndrome. The brain MRI scan was normal, which is consistent with Joubert syndrome. The most likely next step is to order genetic testing to confirm the diagnosis.

The patient is a 75-year-old man with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with isolated deletion 5q (del5q) who presented with multiple nonhealing skin ulcers on the chest and upper extremities. The presenting skin lesions developed 1 month before presentation and began as small pustules that rapidly transformed into painful ulcers. He was treated with valacyclovir for a presumed diagnosis of shingles, but the lesions did not improve. Because of suspected necrotizing fasciitis, he underwent incision and drainage of the lesions. Cultures from the surgical specimen grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus hemolyticus. However, the lesions continued to worsen despite vancomycin and additional debridement. Thus, he was transferred to our facility.

Physical examination showed multiple cutaneous ulcers with gray undermined borders and red papules of varying depths involving the chest, back, and upper extremity; lesions were as large as 9 × 15 cm. A complete blood cell count showed a white blood cell count of 16.2 × 103/μL (to convert to 109/L, multiply by 1.0) with an absolute neutrophil count of 12.7 × 103/μL, hemoglobin level of 9.4 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10.0), and platelet count of 262 × 103/μL with no circulating blasts. Results of additional laboratory studies, including blood culture and tests for herpes zoster virus (via polymerase chain reaction), antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody were all negative. Additionally, the patient also had hypertension and hypercholesterolemia for which he was taking lisinopril and simvastatin, respectively. Pathologic sampling from skin lesions demonstrated a dense dermal infiltrate with predominantly neutrophils along with reactive histiocytes, fibroblasts, and angioplasia (Figure, A). Immunohistochemical staining showed myeloperoxidase-positive neutrophils (Figure, B), histiocytic markers (CD43, CD63, CD168), and CD117-positive mast cells, but no immature myeloid precursors. Results of Grocott-Gomori methenamine silver staining were unremarkable.

A, Hematoxylin-eosin staining shows polymorphonuclear neutrophils admixed with scattered histiocytes and vasculatures with a prominent endothelial lining. B, Immunohistochemical staining shows myeloperoxidase-positive neutrophils peripherally and in aggregates.

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is pyoderma gangrenosum. Pyoderma gangrenosum is a neutrophilic dermatosis that is associated with a variety of underlying conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease, hematologic malignancies, and autoimmune diseases. The characteristic skin lesions of pyoderma gangrenosum are painful, necrotic ulcers that often have undermined borders. The diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum is made clinically, but histologic confirmation may be helpful in some cases. Treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum is typically with systemic corticosteroids, but other agents, such as cyclosporine, azathioprine, and dapsone, may also be used.

The other possible diagnoses in this patient are leukemia cutis, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, and lymphomatoid papulosis. Leukemia cutis is a cutaneous manifestation of leukemia that typically presents with multiple, widespread, nonhealing skin ulcers. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is a small vessel vasculitis that is characterized by the presence of leukocytoclasis (fragmentation of neutrophils) in the walls of small blood vessels. Lymphomatoid papulosis is a chronic, relapsing, self-healing lymphoproliferative disorder that can present with skin lesions that resemble those of pyoderma gangrenosum.

In this patient, the diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum is supported by the clinical presentation, the histologic findings, and the absence of other underlying conditions that could explain the skin lesions. The other possible diagnoses are less likely in this patient because they do not explain all of the features of the presentation.

The patient is a 72-year-old woman with a history of end-stage kidney disease, two kidney transplants, and nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). She currently has visual changes in the left eye, including a relative afferent pupillary defect and an inferior visual field defect. The optic discs are anomalous in appearance, with central excavation in the left eye greater than the right eye.

The differential diagnosis for this patient's visual changes includes NAION, optic neuritis, and optic disc vasculitis. NAION is a common cause of visual loss in patients with kidney disease, and it is thought to be caused by ischemia of the optic nerve head. Optic neuritis is an inflammatory condition of the optic nerve, and it is most commonly seen in patients with multiple sclerosis. Optic disc vasculitis is a rare condition that involves inflammation of the blood vessels in the optic disc.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to obtain a cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. MRI is the most sensitive test for detecting optic nerve ischemia, and it can also help to rule out other causes of visual loss, such as optic neuritis and optic disc vasculitis.

**Answer:** A

Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the best next step in the evaluation of this patient. MRI is the most sensitive test for detecting optic nerve ischemia, and it can also help to rule out other causes of visual loss, such as optic neuritis and optic disc vasculitis.

The patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of multiple squamous cell carcinomas that were treated with Mohs micrographic surgery. He presents with a tender, enlarging scalp lesion of 6 months’ duration. Skin examination reveals a 5-mm bright pink, dome-shaped papule with overlying vessels located at the crown of the scalp. There was no purulent discharge or overlying skin changes. A shave skin biopsy was performed and submitted for histopathologic analysis.

The histopathologic findings show a dermal-based tumor composed of spindle-shaped cells arranged in a vague nodular configuration. The tumor cells are positive for smooth muscle actin. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of angioleiomyoma.

Angioleiomyomas are benign tumors of vascular smooth muscle cells. They are typically found in the skin and subcutaneous tissue, but can also occur in other organs. Angioleiomyomas are usually solitary lesions, but can be multiple. They are most common in adults, and there is no gender predilection.

The clinical presentation of angioleiomyomas is variable. Some lesions are asymptomatic, while others may be painful or tender. Angioleiomyomas can be red, purple, or brown in color. They are usually small, measuring less than 1 cm in diameter. However, they can grow larger, and some lesions have been reported to measure up to 10 cm in diameter.

The diagnosis of angioleiomyoma is made on the basis of clinical presentation and histopathologic findings. Angioleiomyomas are typically treated by excision. However, small, asymptomatic lesions may be managed conservatively.

The patient is a healthy female in her late 20s with a 2-year history of multiple, slowly growing, infiltrated erythematous-violaceous patches and plaques, with occasional slight pain extending from her left upper arm to the left side of her chest. No triggers, such as local infection, insect bite, or trauma, occurred before the appearance of the lesions. She denied fever, weight loss, or fatigue. Physical examination showed multiple firm, nonscaly, purple erythematous patches and plaques with irregular borders on her left axilla, medial upper arm, and lateral thoracic region. No extracutaneous involvement was observed. A skin biopsy specimen was obtained from the left side of her chest for histopathological examination.

The histopathological examination showed irregularly branched, thin-walled blood vessels dissecting through collagen bundles within the superficial to mid dermis. The endothelial cells were plump and dispersed between thickened collagen bundles without signs of atypia. The endothelial cells were positive for cluster of differentiation (CD) 31 (CD31).

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of microvenular hemangioma. Microvenular hemangiomas are benign vascular tumors that are characterized by the proliferation of small, thin-walled capillaries. They are most commonly found on the skin, but can also occur in other organs, such as the liver, spleen, and lungs.

Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic drug that is used to treat a variety of arrhythmias, including atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia, and torsades de pointes. Amiodarone is a lipophilic drug that has a long half-life and can accumulate in the body over time. Amiodarone can cause a number of side effects, including pulmonary toxicity, which is a serious and potentially fatal complication. Pulmonary toxicity is typically seen in patients who have received amiodarone for more than 6 months, but it can occur at any time. The most common symptoms of pulmonary toxicity are dyspnea, cough, and fatigue. Chest radiography may show infiltrates in both lung fields. Pulmonary function tests may show a decrease in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC). Treatment of pulmonary toxicity includes discontinuing amiodarone and administering corticosteroids.

The patient is a woman in her late 60s who presented to the emergency department after an episode of syncope. She described several other episodes occurring at rest over the past several weeks. She denied palpitations, chest pain, and shortness of breath. She was otherwise in excellent health and not taking any medications. She had no family history of syncope or sudden death. Her vital signs and physical examination were unremarkable. The initial electrocardiogram (ECG) results were normal, but premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) were noted on telemetry. Shortly thereafter, 2 episodes of fast polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PVT), 30 minutes apart, were recorded, both lasting less than 4 seconds. A repeat ECG showed PVCs. Laboratory test results including serum potassium and magnesium as well as 3 serial troponin levels were normal. Echocardiography showed normal left ventricular systolic function without wall motion abnormalities or valvular abnormalities. Coronary angiography showed a 50% stenosis of the left circumflex artery. Instant wave-free ratio across the stenosis was 1.0.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of ventricular arrhythmias. The ECG findings of PVCs and PVT support this diagnosis. The laboratory test results are normal, which suggests that the arrhythmias are not due to a metabolic or electrolyte abnormality. The echocardiography findings are normal, which suggests that the arrhythmias are not due to structural heart disease. The coronary angiography findings show a 50% stenosis of the left circumflex artery, but the instant wave-free ratio across the stenosis is 1.0, which suggests that the stenosis is not hemodynamically significant.

The patient's clinical presentation and the results of her diagnostic testing suggest that she is at risk for sudden cardiac death. The next step in her management should be to implant a defibrillator. A defibrillator is a device that is implanted in the chest and can deliver an electric shock to the heart if it detects a life-threatening arrhythmia. This will help to prevent sudden cardiac death.

The patient is a 70-year-old woman with hypertension, atrial fibrillation, congestive heart failure, and gallstones who presents with 3 days of nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. She is afebrile, her blood pressure is 80/60 mm Hg, and heart rate is 122/min. On physical examination, her abdomen is distended, tympanic, and slightly tender to palpation diffusely. Blood testing shows a white blood cell count of 10 450/μL (84.1% neutrophils); C-reactive protein level, 9.5 mg/dL; potassium level, 3.0 mEq/L (reference, 3.6-5.2 mEq/L); and creatinine level, 5.57 mg/dL (429.39 μmol/L, up from a baseline level of 0.80 mg/dL [70.72 μmol/L]). Sodium and liver function values are normal.

In the emergency department, she receives a 500-mL bolus of intravenous crystalloid fluid and 1 g of intravenous ceftriaxone. A nasogastric tube is placed and initially drained 300 mL of biliary fluid. A non–contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan is performed, which shows a thickened gallbladder with air and gallstones adherent to the duodenum, with a suspected fistula tract. There is also a 2.7-cm gallstone in the middle ileum and proximal bowel distension.

The patient's presentation is consistent with acute cholecystitis with a probable gallstone ileus. The CT scan findings confirm the diagnosis. The next step in management is to plan for surgical intervention. The patient should be resuscitated with intravenous fluids and antibiotics.

The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of a hysterectomy and estrogen replacement therapy. She presents with a palpable left axillary mass. Imaging studies show a 5.2-cm left axillary mass with no breast lesions. Pathology reveals a high-grade adenocarcinoma with papillary features that is positive for PAX8, p53, and WT1 and negative for GATA3.

The most likely diagnosis is high-grade carcinoma of the breast with occult primary. This is supported by the patient's history of breast cancer, the presence of a left axillary mass, and the positive immunohistochemical staining for PAX8, p53, and WT1. Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid is less likely in this patient because she does not have any risk factors for thyroid cancer, and the tumor is not located in the thyroid gland. High-grade serous carcinoma of gynecological origin is also less likely in this patient because she does not have any risk factors for gynecological cancer, and the tumor is not located in the gynecological tract. High-grade papillary carcinoma of unknown primary is a diagnosis of exclusion, and it is only made after all other possible diagnoses have been ruled out.

The patient is an 11-year-old girl with a painless, left-sided neck mass that has been slowly enlarging for 8 months. The mass is firm, fixed, well-circumscribed, and without overlying skin changes or cutaneous involvement. She has no other masses, cervical lymphadenopathy, or systemic symptoms.

The initial ultrasound imaging showed a hypoechoic mass. Fine-needle aspiration and core-needle biopsy were inconclusive, demonstrating histiocytes. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a well-circumscribed mass of mainly soft tissue density with contrast enhancement.

Given persistence of the lesion and inconclusive biopsies, the decision was made to pursue surgical excision. The mass was found to attach deep to the middle scalene and was fed by several unnamed vessels; however, there was no involvement of the clavicle.

Pathology confirmed complete excision of a well-circumscribed lesion with peripheral casing of bone, cyst-like spaces filled with serous fluid, walls of spindle-shaped fibroblasts, osteoclast-type giant cells, thin trabeculae of woven bone surfaced with osteoblasts, and scattered macrophages. There was local infiltration into surrounding skeletal muscle, but no atypical mitoses or pleomorphic cells were identified. The lesion was positive for USP6 locus rearrangement (17p13.2) on fluorescence in situ hybridization.

The differential diagnosis for a slow-growing pediatric neck mass includes a variety of benign and malignant tumors. The most common benign tumors include lymphadenopathy, hemangioma, and lipoma. The most common malignant tumors include rhabdomyosarcoma, Ewing sarcoma, and osteosarcoma.

In this case, the patient's age, the location of the mass, the lack of systemic symptoms, and the benign appearance on imaging studies all suggest a benign diagnosis. The finding of USP6 locus rearrangement on fluorescence in situ hybridization is highly specific for ossifying fibromyxoid tumor (OFMT). OFMT is a rare, benign soft tissue tumor that typically occurs in children and young adults. It is characterized by the presence of spindle-shaped fibroblasts, osteoclast-type giant cells, and thin trabeculae of woven bone. OFMT is typically treated with surgical excision.

The patient is a healthy, uncircumcised man in his 30s who presents with a 14-year history of dyspareunia and recurrent, purulent discharge from his penis. He has undergone multiple evaluations by dermatologists and urologists and has not responded to systemic antibiotics and topical corticosteroids. Physical examination reveals an erythematous, pinpoint orifice on his glans penis, with peripheral telangiectasias and a linear bluish structure on dermoscopy. Ultrasonography reveals a hypoechoic focal zone on the right side of the glans, with multiple hyperechoic bilaminar structures. A biopsy was performed.

The differential diagnosis for a pinpoint orifice on the glans penis includes pilonidal sinus, cutaneous larva migrans, median raphe cyst, and vellus hair cyst. Pilonidal sinus is a common condition that occurs in the sacrococcygeal region. It is caused by ingrown hairs that become infected. Cutaneous larva migrans is a parasitic infection that is caused by the larvae of certain nematodes. It is characterized by a linear, serpiginous rash. Median raphe cyst is a benign cyst that occurs along the median raphe of the penis. Vellus hair cyst is a small, hair-containing cyst that occurs in the skin.

The patient's history and physical examination are most consistent with a diagnosis of pilonidal sinus. The presence of an erythematous, pinpoint orifice on the glans penis, with peripheral telangiectasias and a linear bluish structure on dermoscopy, is characteristic of pilonidal sinus. The ultrasonographic findings of a hypoechoic focal zone on the right side of the glans, with multiple hyperechoic bilaminar structures, are also consistent with a diagnosis of pilonidal sinus.

The patient has a history of right ear pain and fullness, discomfort over her frontal and maxillary sinuses, and nasal congestion without discharge. Over the past 2 weeks, she has experienced drenching night sweats, cramps in her quadriceps, and weight loss of 3 kg. She denied respiratory symptoms, headaches, scalp tenderness, or jaw claudication. She took no regular medication and did not smoke.

At presentation, her visual acuities were perception of light OD and 20/20 OS. There was a right relative afferent pupillary defect. Dilated fundus examination showed a cherry red spot in the right macula with hyperreflectivity and thickening of the inner retinal layers on optical coherence tomography. External eye examination results and ocular motility were normal. Examination by an otolaryngologist revealed normal tympanic membranes and a dry but otherwise normal nasal mucosa on flexible endoscopy. Blood tests showed leukocytosis (white blood cell count, 15 000 /µL; to convert to 109 per liter, multiply by 0.001) with neutrophilia (white blood cell count, 12 500 /µL), elevated C-reactive protein (19.4 mg/dL; to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10), elevated plasma viscosity (2.06 mPas), and thrombocytosis (467 ×103/µL; to convert to ×109 per liter, multiply by 1). Kidney function was within normal limits. Chest radiograph results were unremarkable.

The patient's presentation is concerning for giant cell arteritis (GCA), a systemic vasculitis that typically affects patients over the age of 50. GCA can cause a variety of symptoms, including headache, scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and polymyalgia rheumatica. Ocular involvement in GCA is common, and can present as amaurosis fugax, retinal artery occlusion, or optic neuritis.

The gold standard for diagnosis of GCA is temporal artery biopsy. However, in patients with a high clinical suspicion of GCA, treatment can be initiated with high-dose corticosteroids without biopsy, while awaiting the results of the biopsy. Treatment of GCA with corticosteroids is typically life-long, and is aimed at preventing permanent visual loss and other complications.

In the patient described above, the findings of a right relative afferent pupillary defect, a cherry red spot in the right macula, and hyperreflectivity and thickening of the inner retinal layers on optical coherence tomography are all consistent with GCA. The patient's history of right ear pain and fullness, discomfort over her frontal and maxillary sinuses, and nasal congestion without discharge, as well as her elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and plasma viscosity, are also consistent with GCA.

Given the patient's high clinical suspicion of GCA, treatment with high-dose corticosteroids should be initiated without biopsy. The patient should also be referred to a rheumatologist for further management.

A magnetic resonance image (MRI) of orbits and sinuses is not necessary in this case, as the diagnosis of GCA is based on clinical findings and temporal artery biopsy. An MRI may be helpful in ruling out other possible causes of the patient's vision loss, such as a tumor or a stroke. However, in the absence of any other symptoms or findings that suggest these conditions, an MRI is not necessary.

Comencing broad-spectrum antibiotics is not indicated in this case, as the patient's symptoms are not consistent with an infectious process. The patient's white blood cell count is elevated, but this is not specific for infection. The patient's C-reactive protein and plasma viscosity are also elevated, but these findings are non-specific and can be seen in a variety of conditions, including GCA.

Requesting an urgent stroke consult is not indicated in this case, as the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a stroke. The patient's vision loss is sudden and painless, but this is not a typical presentation for a stroke. The patient's history of right ear pain and fullness, discomfort over her frontal and maxillary sinuses, and nasal congestion without discharge, as well as her elevated white blood cell count, C-reactive protein, and plasma viscosity, are all more consistent with GCA than a stroke.

The patient received a single dose of intravenous vancomycin and ceftriaxone, then was transitioned to ampicillin-sulbactam for presumed orbital cellulitis. After 48 hours, motility, proptosis, and chemosis worsened. Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits with and without contrast was remarkable for proptosis with optic nerve straightening, enhancement of the intraconal and extraconal fat, edema and enhancement of the right extraocular muscles, new thickening of the left sphenoid sinus with internal air-fluid level, and new inflammation of the left masticator space. A follow-up computed tomography of the sinus with contrast showed no evidence of osseous structure destruction to suggest invasive fungal sinusitis. Under guidance from the infectious disease service, antibiotics were broadened back to vancomycin and ceftriaxone with continued worsening.

The differential diagnosis for acute-onset orbital inflammation includes orbital cellulitis, orbital pseudotumor, and invasive fungal sinusitis. Orbital cellulitis is an infection of the soft tissues of the orbit, and it is most commonly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, or Haemophilus influenzae. Orbital pseudotumor is a noninfectious inflammatory condition of the orbit, and it is most commonly idiopathic, but it can also be associated with autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus or rheumatoid arthritis. Invasive fungal sinusitis is a rare, but serious, infection of the sinuses that can spread to the orbit.

In this case, the patient's history of multiple myeloma is a risk factor for invasive fungal sinusitis. The patient's presentation with acute-onset orbital inflammation, proptosis, and chemosis is concerning for orbital cellulitis, orbital pseudotumor, or invasive fungal sinusitis. The imaging findings of right preseptal edema and intraorbital fat stranding of the extraconal and intraconal fat without sinus disease are consistent with orbital cellulitis. However, the new thickening of the left sphenoid sinus with internal air-fluid level and new inflammation of the left masticator space are concerning for invasive fungal sinusitis.

The next step in the management of this patient is to obtain a biopsy of the orbital tissue. A biopsy will help to determine the underlying cause of the patient's orbital inflammation and guide further management. If the biopsy shows evidence of invasive fungal sinusitis, the patient will need to be treated with antifungal therapy. If the biopsy shows evidence of orbital cellulitis, the patient will need to be treated with antibiotics. If the biopsy shows evidence of orbital pseudotumor, the patient may be treated with corticosteroids.

The patient's presentation is concerning for sepsis, which is a life-threatening infection. The patient has acute chest pain, respiratory insufficiency, and a low hemoglobin level. These findings are consistent with sepsis.

The next step in management is to obtain blood cultures to identify the organism causing the infection. A vitreous tap can be performed to collect fluid from the eye to look for evidence of infection. Antibiotics should be started immediately after blood cultures are obtained.

Laser iridotomy is not indicated in this patient. Laser iridotomy is a procedure used to treat angle-closure glaucoma. The patient's glaucoma is not angle-closure glaucoma.

Observation is not an appropriate management strategy in this patient. The patient has signs of sepsis, which is a life-threatening infection.

Hemoglobin electrophoresis is not indicated in this patient. Hemoglobin electrophoresis is a test used to diagnose hemoglobinopathies, such as sickle cell anemia. The patient does not have a hemoglobinopathy.

Therefore, the correct answer is A. Obtain blood cultures, perform vitreous tap, and inject antibiotics.

The patient is a 56-year-old woman with metastatic hormone receptor–positive, ERBB2-negative breast cancer. She had locally advanced disease that was invading the skin overlying her right breast and metastatic disease to the thoracic and lumbar spine, liver, and mediastinal, axillary, and retroperitoneal lymph nodes. Her disease had progressed after receiving first-line therapy with palbociclib and anastrozole. Subsequent treatments with fulvestrant and paclitaxel were also followed by progressive disease. She received treatment with capecitabine; after 6 weeks of treatment, she developed some redness on her hands and feet that resolved on its own. She then presented to the clinic with pruritic, erythematous, scaly macules and papules on her forearms, faces, chest, and upper back (Figure). The rash had been present for 3 weeks and had recently worsened. Her palms and soles were spared. The rash did not respond to treatment with topical clindamycin, oral solumedrol, or doxycycline. She had a history of substantial sun exposure but no history of skin cancer.

The most likely diagnosis is **medication hypersensitivity reaction**. The patient has a history of metastatic breast cancer that has been treated with multiple lines of therapy, including capecitabine. She developed a rash after starting capecitabine treatment, which worsened despite treatment with topical clindamycin, oral solumedrol, and doxycycline. The rash is pruritic, erythematous, scaly, and involves the forearms, face, chest, and upper back. These findings are consistent with a medication hypersensitivity reaction.

Cutaneous deposits of metastatic breast cancer are less likely in this patient because she has no history of skin cancer. Inflammation of actinic keratoses is also less likely because the patient has no history of sun exposure and the rash does not involve the palms and soles. Discoid lupus erythematosus is also less likely because the rash is not photosensitive and the patient does not have any other systemic symptoms.

Granular cell tumors are the most common mesenchymal tumors of the larynx and trachea, accounting for approximately 50% of all laryngeal tumors in children. They are typically benign, but can be locally aggressive and rarely metastasize. Granular cell tumors are thought to arise from Schwann cells, and are composed of large, granular cells with abundant cytoplasm. They are typically well-circumscribed and encapsulated, and can be pedunculated or sessile. On histopathology, granular cell tumors show a characteristic "salt and pepper" appearance due to the presence of large, eosinophilic granules in the cytoplasm of the tumor cells. Treatment for granular cell tumors is typically surgical excision. The prognosis is excellent, with most patients having no recurrence after complete resection.

The patient is a 25-month-old child with unilateral hearing loss. Clinical findings suggested unilateral right middle ear effusion associated with ipsilateral conductive hearing loss. After an initial observation period, a right tympanostomy tube was inserted. During the procedure, a clear liquid pulsating from the middle ear was noted, and samples were sent for β-2-transferrine analysis. This confirmed the presence of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leak.

The patient was referred to a tertiary referral center hospital. The leak settled with conservative management, and imaging of the brain and skull base was performed. A high-resolution computed tomography scan of the temporal bone showed a lytic aspect of the right temporal bone extending to the petrous apex and the petrous bone, sparing the otic capsule. There was soft tissue opacification of the right mastoid air cells. Magnetic resonance imaging of the skull base with contrast was performed. It showed a hyperintense T2 signal in the petrous apex and mastoid air cells. There was a suspected communication into the soft tissues of the right neck in the posterior triangle. Magnetic resonance imaging also showed signs of Chiari malformation type 1. After a skull base multidisciplinary discussion, the patient underwent a bone biopsy through a transmastoid approach.

The histopathological examination of the biopsy specimen showed a proliferation of Langerhans cells in the bone marrow and soft tissues. The patient was diagnosed with Langerhans cell histiocytosis.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare, non-cancerous disease that affects the cells of the immune system. It is characterized by the proliferation of Langerhans cells, which are a type of white blood cell. LCH can affect any part of the body, but it most commonly affects the bones, skin, and lymph nodes.

The exact cause of LCH is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a genetic mutation. LCH is most commonly diagnosed in children under the age of 10, but it can occur in adults as well.

There is no cure for LCH, but there are treatments that can help to control the disease. Treatment typically involves a combination of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery.

The prognosis for children with LCH is generally good. With treatment, most children will go into remission and have a normal life expectancy. However, some children may experience long-term complications from the disease, such as bone deformities or hearing loss.

The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of essential thrombocytosis (ET) who has been treated with hydroxyurea for 14 years. She presents with numerous, primarily photodistributed, crusted, and ulcerated plaques of the trunk and extremities. The ulcerations have slowly increased in number and size over several years and are quite painful. She has a history of nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSCa), which has previously been treated surgically.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes hydroxyurea-induced ulcerations, hydroxyurea-induced squamous dysplasia, hydroxyurea-induced phototoxic eruption, and iatrogenic epidermodysplasia verruciformis.

Hydroxyurea-induced ulcerations are a well-known side effect of this medication. They typically occur in patients who have been treated with hydroxyurea for long periods of time. The ulcerations are usually located on sun-exposed areas of the skin, such as the face, neck, and hands. They are often painful and may be accompanied by crusting and bleeding.

Hydroxyurea-induced squamous dysplasia is a precancerous condition that can occur in patients who have been treated with hydroxyurea for long periods of time. The dysplasia is usually located on sun-exposed areas of the skin, such as the face, neck, and hands. It is characterized by abnormal changes in the cells of the skin.

Hydroxyurea-induced phototoxic eruption is a type of allergic reaction that can occur in patients who are exposed to sunlight while taking hydroxyurea. The eruption is characterized by redness, swelling, and blisters on the skin. It is usually most severe on sun-exposed areas of the skin, such as the face, neck, and hands.

Iatrogenic epidermodysplasia verruciformis is a rare condition that can occur in patients who have been treated with hydroxyurea for long periods of time. The condition is characterized by the development of multiple wart-like lesions on the skin. The lesions are usually located on sun-exposed areas of the skin, such as the face, neck, and hands.

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is hydroxyurea-induced ulcerations. This is because the patient has a history of long-term treatment with hydroxyurea, the ulcerations are located on sun-exposed areas of the skin, and they are painful and associated with crusting and bleeding.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes hydroxyurea-induced squamous dysplasia, hydroxyurea-induced phototoxic eruption, and iatrogenic epidermodysplasia verruciformis. However, these conditions are less likely than hydroxyurea-induced ulcerations.

She was diagnosed with neurofibromatosis at the age of 10 and underwent surgical resection of the tumors. However, the tumors recurred 5 years after surgery, with their size and number gradually increasing with age. Physical examination revealed scalp masses from 4 to 6 cm in diameter, with hard textures and smooth surfaces, and subcutaneous nodules of 1 × 1 cm to 2 × 2 cm with hard textures on the hands, feet, trunk, and lower extremities. The patient had no tenderness, swelling, or other skin manifestations. The patient had consanguineous parents, but no other family member, including her children, had the disease.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is juvenile hyaline fibromatosis (JHF). JHF is a rare, inherited disorder characterized by the development of multiple subcutaneous nodules. The nodules are usually present at birth or in early childhood and tend to increase in size and number with age. They are typically painless, firm, and non-tender. JHF is caused by mutations in the gene encoding the protein hyaluronan synthase 2 (HYAL2). HYAL2 is responsible for the production of hyaluronan, a glycosaminoglycan that is found in the extracellular matrix. Mutations in HYAL2 lead to the accumulation of hyaluronan in the skin and other tissues, which results in the formation of the characteristic nodules.

The diagnosis of JHF is based on the clinical presentation and the findings of a skin biopsy. The biopsy typically shows the presence of large amounts of homogeneous eosinophilic hyaline matrix with scattered fibroblasts. There is no specific treatment for JHF, but the nodules can be surgically removed if they are symptomatic. The prognosis for patients with JHF is generally good, although the nodules may recur.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of torsade de pointes (TdP). TdP is a polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation and cardiac arrest. The most common cause of TdP is a prolonged QT interval, which can be caused by a number of factors, including electrolyte abnormalities, medications, and structural heart disease.

The patient's ECG shows a prolonged QT interval with T-wave alternans, which are both risk factors for TdP. In addition, the patient has a history of cardiac arrest due to ventricular arrhythmias. These factors suggest that the patient is at high risk for recurrent TdP.

The most important step in the management of TdP is to identify and treat the underlying cause. In this case, the patient's QT interval is prolonged due to the use of metoprolol. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker that can prolong the QT interval. Therefore, the first step in the management of this patient is to discontinue metoprolol.

Once the underlying cause of TdP has been identified and treated, the next step is to prevent recurrence of TdP. This can be done by correcting any electrolyte abnormalities, discontinuing any medications that may prolong the QT interval, and implanting an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD).

In this case, the patient's electrolyte levels are normal. However, she is still at risk for recurrent TdP due to her prolonged QT interval and history of cardiac arrest. Therefore, it is recommended that she undergo an ICD implant.

The patient's symptoms of dyspnea and chest pain are consistent with a cardiac tamponade. Cardiac tamponade is a life-threatening condition that occurs when fluid accumulates in the pericardial sac, which surrounds the heart. This fluid can cause the heart to be compressed, which can lead to decreased cardiac output and shock.

The first step in the management of cardiac tamponade is to relieve the pressure on the heart. This can be done by performing pericardiocentesis, which is a procedure in which a needle is inserted into the pericardial sac to drain the fluid. Intravenous thrombolysis and catheter-directed thromboembolectomy are other treatment options for cardiac tamponade, but they are not as effective as pericardiocentesis.

The patient has 3 darkly pigmented corneal lesions, which are suspicious for fungal keratitis. Fungal keratitis is a serious infection of the cornea that can lead to vision loss. It is important to diagnose and treat fungal keratitis early to prevent permanent damage to the cornea.

The most common way to diagnose fungal keratitis is to obtain a sample of the aqueous humor (fluid inside the eye) or vitreous humor (fluid inside the back of the eye) and test it for fungal spores or hyphae. This test is called a fungal polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

If the PCR test is positive for fungal keratitis, the patient will need to be treated with antifungal medications. The type of antifungal medication and the length of treatment will depend on the type of fungus that is causing the infection.

The patient is a 48-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, very poorly controlled type 2 diabetes, hyperlipidemia, tobacco use, and asthma. She presented with 3 days of worsening right orbital swelling, eye pain, blurry vision, and 3 months of bilateral photophobia. She also reported bilateral rhinorrhea, congestion, and right frontal and temporal headaches. Her brother and father both had a history of chronic orbital swelling.

On examination, the patient had moderate chemosis, injected conjunctiva, and periorbital edema. Both eyes were proptotic, right worse than left. She had normal bilateral extraocular movements, pupillary light reflexes, and gross vision. Computed tomography with contrast revealed bilateral ethmoid and frontal sinus opacification and right worse than left orbital fat stranding. Magnetic resonance imaging with contrast demonstrated both enlargement and enhancement of bilateral extraocular muscles, especially the right superior rectus.

Initially the patient was started on antibiotic therapy. Right nasal biopsy, right endoscopic sinus surgery, and right anterior superior orbital tissue biopsy were performed. Intraoperatively, the sinus mucosa demonstrated only edema and mild secretions, but there was no necrosis or purulence. Both orbital and nasal cultures grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Orbital biopsy showed nodular lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates without evidence of fungal infection or necrosis. Further workup revealed elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, total IgG, and IgG4 levels and normal white blood cell count, thyroid-stimulating hormone, angiotensin-converting enzyme, lysozyme, antinuclear antibody, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) levels.

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is IgG4-related disease. IgG4-related disease is a systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by the infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells and lymphocytes into various organs and tissues. It can affect any organ system, but the most common sites of involvement are the salivary glands, pancreas, liver, kidneys, and retroperitoneum. Orbital involvement is rare, but it can occur in up to 10% of patients with IgG4-related disease.

The clinical features of IgG4-related disease are variable and can depend on the organs involved. In the case of orbital involvement, patients may present with orbital swelling, proptosis, diplopia, and vision loss. The diagnosis of IgG4-related disease is made based on clinical features, imaging findings, and laboratory tests. Imaging studies, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, may show enlargement of the involved organs. Laboratory tests may show elevated levels of IgG4 in the blood and urine.

The treatment of IgG4-related disease is generally with corticosteroids. In some cases, other immunosuppressive agents, such as rituximab, may be necessary. The prognosis of IgG4-related disease is generally good with treatment, but the disease can be relapsing and remitting.

The patient is a 69-year-old woman with a newly diagnosed T3N2cM0 poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma unrelated to human papillomavirus (HPV) of the lower lip mucosa. She presented to the medical oncology clinic 3 days after initiating neoadjuvant immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy with redness and swelling of the tumor site. Four days after treatment, a white head formed overlying the tumor that erupted through the skin surface. Thin, cloudy discharge that was not foul-smelling drained from the tumor from posttreatment days 5 to 10, at which point the drainage stopped spontaneously. Throughout, the patient reported no pain and remained afebrile. Laboratory results on days 5, 9, and 14 demonstrated the absence of leukocytosis, and serial wound cultures failed to demonstrate pathogenic growth. No antibiotics were administered. The patient completed the neoadjuvant immunotherapy and underwent a margin-negative tumor resection without intraoperative or postoperative complications.

The most likely diagnosis is immunotherapy-related inflammation. This is supported by the following findings:

* The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with an immune response to the tumor, including redness, swelling, and drainage.
* The patient's laboratory results are consistent with an immune response, including the absence of leukocytosis and the negative wound cultures.
* The patient's clinical course is consistent with an immune response, with the inflammation resolving after the completion of immunotherapy.

Infection and suppuration are less likely diagnoses. This is because the patient did not have fever or leukocytosis, and the wound cultures were negative. Tumor progression is also a less likely diagnosis. This is because the patient's clinical course was consistent with an immune response, with the inflammation resolving after the completion of immunotherapy. An allergic reaction is also a less likely diagnosis. This is because the patient did not have any symptoms of an allergic reaction, such as rash, hives, or swelling.

Since the initial onset, the bruise and pain had persisted despite icing and resting the area. She denied any personal or family history of bleeding disorders. On examination, an ill-defined indurated blue-green plaque was noted on the dorsum of the left hand. Radiography results showed soft tissue swelling but were otherwise unremarkable. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging showed a heterogeneously fluid hyperintense and T1 heterogeneously hyperintense lesion measuring approximately 1.6 × 0.5 × 2.9 cm that was centered within the dorsal subcutaneous soft tissue of the hand. An excision was performed.

The most likely diagnosis is pigmented dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (Bednar tumor). This is a rare, locally aggressive cutaneous neoplasm that typically presents as a solitary, slowly growing, painless, blue-brown papule or nodule on the extremities. The lesion is often misdiagnosed as a bruise or hematoma, and it may be several years before a definitive diagnosis is made. Histologically, pigmented dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is characterized by a proliferation of spindle-shaped cells arranged in fascicles and storiform patterns. The tumor cells often contain melanin pigment, which is responsible for the blue-brown color of the lesion.

The treatment of choice for pigmented dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is surgical excision with wide margins. In some cases, radiation therapy may be used as an adjunct to surgery. The prognosis for patients with pigmented dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is good, with most patients achieving long-term disease control with appropriate treatment.

The patient is a woman in her 60s who presented with a pruritic rash that initially developed on her legs 13 days before presentation and subsequently progressed to her feet, arms, hands, and trunk. Associated symptoms included a burning sensation and occasional pain. Her medical history was notable for endometrial adenocarcinoma status post hysterectomy and recent postoperative radiotherapy (total of 50.4 Gy in 28 fractioned doses), which was completed 4 days after the onset of the rash. She denied any new medications or exposure to chemotherapy, imaging with intravenous contrast, or recent travel. The remainder of her review of systems was unremarkable. On physical examination, there were numerous erythematous edematous coalescing papules and plaques on the upper and lower extremities and scattered erythematous papules and plaques on the back and buttocks. Some plaques were annular and polycyclic in configuration, with central hyperpigmentation. Her chest, abdomen, face, and oral mucosa were clear. A complete blood cell count was notable for an eosinophilia of 11%, with an absolute cell count of 0.80 ×103/uL. Results from a comprehensive metabolic panel were normal. A biopsy was performed on her right thigh for histopathological examination.

The most likely diagnosis is eosinophilic, polymorphic, and pruritic eruption associated with radiotherapy (EPPER). EPPER is a rare, self-limited skin eruption that occurs after radiotherapy. It is characterized by a pruritic rash with erythematous papules and plaques, often with central hyperpigmentation. The rash typically occurs within 2 weeks of radiotherapy and resolves within 6-8 weeks. The pathogenesis of EPPER is not fully understood, but it is thought to be an immune-mediated reaction to radiation damage.

The differential diagnosis for EPPER includes radiation-induced bullous pemphigoid, urticaria vasculitis, and urticaria multiforme. Radiation-induced bullous pemphigoid is a blistering skin disorder that occurs after radiotherapy. It is characterized by subepidermal blisters that often rupture, leaving denuded areas of skin. Urticarial vasculitis is a vasculitis that can occur after radiotherapy. It is characterized by erythematous papules and plaques that often have a central wheal. Urticaria multiforme is a hypersensitivity reaction that can occur after radiotherapy. It is characterized by erythematous papules and plaques that often have a central wheal.

The diagnosis of EPPER is made clinically, based on the history and physical examination findings. A biopsy may be helpful to rule out other causes of the rash. The treatment of EPPER is supportive. Topical corticosteroids and antihistamines can be used to relieve the itching. The rash typically resolves within 6-8 weeks.

The patient has a history of nonspecific T-wave abnormalities on ECG, which is a risk factor for ventricular tachycardia. He presented with new-onset chest discomfort, diaphoresis, and shortness of breath that woke him from sleep, which are symptoms of ventricular tachycardia. He was found to be in a wide complex tachycardia on arrival to the emergency department, and he required synchronized cardioversion with a biphasic direct current shock of 100 J to terminate the arrhythmia. His initial 12-lead ECG showed a wide complex tachycardia with left bundle branch block morphology, which is consistent with ventricular tachycardia. He continued in sinus rhythm with episodes of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia observed on telemetry. Cardiac catheterization revealed patent coronary arteries, which rules out coronary artery disease as a cause of his ventricular tachycardia. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was remarkable for a dilated right ventricle with moderately reduced systolic function and transmural late gadolinium enhancement with akinesis and dyskinesis involving the right ventricular free wall and outflow tract extending to the left ventricular anterior, septal, and apical segments. This finding suggests that the patient has right ventricular cardiomyopathy, which is a known cause of ventricular tachycardia.

Given the patient's history, presentation, and findings on cardiac catheterization and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, the most likely diagnosis is right ventricular cardiomyopathy with ventricular tachycardia. The next step in management is to implant an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). An ICD is a device that is implanted in the chest and can deliver an electric shock to terminate ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. This is the standard of care for patients with ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation, as it can prevent sudden cardiac death.

SAPHO syndrome is a rare, chronic, multisystem inflammatory disease characterized by synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis. It is most commonly seen in young adults, and men are more commonly affected than women. The exact cause of SAPHO syndrome is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disease.

The classic presentation of SAPHO syndrome is the triad of synovitis, acne, and pustulosis. However, the disease can present with a variety of other symptoms, including bone pain, fever, fatigue, and weight loss. The diagnosis of SAPHO syndrome is made based on the clinical presentation and the results of imaging studies, such as X-rays and MRI. There is no cure for SAPHO syndrome, but treatment can help to control the symptoms. Treatment typically includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, and antibiotics. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove affected bone.

The patient in this case has many of the classic features of SAPHO syndrome. He has a history of synovitis, acne, and pustulosis. He also has bone pain, fever, and fatigue. The results of his imaging studies are consistent with SAPHO syndrome. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is SAPHO syndrome.

  6%|▌         | 84/1525 [19:50<6:09:36, 15.39s/it]The correct answer is: A. Obtain serologic test results for Treponema pallidum.

The patient presents with irregular gray-white ulcers with a surrounding erythema on the soft palate, uvula, and tonsils. This is consistent with the clinical presentation of secondary syphilis, which is caused by the spirochete Treponema pallidum. Secondary syphilis is a systemic disease that can affect the skin, mucous membranes, lymph nodes, and central nervous system. It is typically diagnosed by serologic testing, such as the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test or the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test. If these tests are positive, a confirmatory test, such as the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test, can be performed.

Treatment for secondary syphilis is with penicillin, either intramuscularly or intravenously. Oral amoxicillin or topical nystatin are not effective treatments for syphilis.

Reasoning:
The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with the diagnosis of secondary syphilis. The irregular gray-white ulcers with a surrounding erythema on the soft palate, uvula, and tonsils are typical of secondary syphilis. The patient also has nontender bilateral submandibular lymphadenopathy, which is another common finding in secondary syphilis.

The most important diagnostic test for secondary syphilis is serologic testing. The VDRL test and the RPR test are the most commonly used serologic tests for syphilis. These tests are non-treponemal tests, which means that they detect antibodies to antigens that are not specific to Treponema pallidum. If these tests are positive, a confirmatory test, such as the FTA-ABS test, can be performed. The FTA-ABS test is a treponemal test, which means that it detects antibodies to Treponema pallidum itself.

Treatment for secondary syphilis is with penicillin, either intramuscularly or intravenously. Oral amoxicillin or topical nystatin are not effective treatments for syphilis.

The patient is a 7-year-old African American girl with a 2-month history of progressive painless right-sided neck swelling. She initially experienced fever and sore throat. Physical examination findings demonstrate minimally tender and nonmobile 4-cm right submandibular space swelling. Laboratory examination findings are significant for leukocytosis with neutrophilia, anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and elevated C-reactive protein level. Ultrasonography reveals multiple enlarged hyperemic lymph nodes within the right side of the neck, the largest measuring 3.4 × 2.4 × 2.1 cm in the submandibular space. She was treated with oral antibiotics without improvement. Ultrasonography at 1-month follow-up revealed interval enlargement of the lymph nodes, which appeared rounded in shape, without preservation of internal architecture. The mother reported that the patient lost 3.2 kg in 2 months, without any chills or night sweats, difficulty swallowing or breathing, change in voice, abdominal pain, recent travel, or exposure to animals or pets.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrates extensive unilateral right-sided neck adenopathy, the largest nodes measuring approximately 4 cm at level IB; an approximately 2-cm destructive mass involving the left maxillary malar eminence; and additional lesions involving the T4 vertebra and upper sternum. Fluorodeoxyglucose 18F-labeled positron emission tomography with computed tomography (FDG PET/CT) demonstrates extensive FDG-avid right-sided cervical lymphadenopathy and innumerable FDG-avid lytic foci involving the axial and appendicular skeleton.

The differential diagnosis for a young child with painless neck swelling includes a variety of benign and malignant conditions. Benign conditions include reactive lymphadenopathy, lymphadenitis, and cystic hygroma. Malignant conditions include Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Langerhans cell histiocytosis, and neuroblastoma.

The patient's history and physical examination findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). LCH is a rare, non-malignant disorder of the Langerhans cells, which are a type of white blood cell. LCH can affect any organ system, but the most common sites of involvement are the skin, bones, and lymph nodes. The classic presentation of LCH is a painless swelling of the lymph nodes, often in the neck or axillae. Other common symptoms include fever, rash, weight loss, and fatigue.

The laboratory findings in LCH are often non-specific, but may include leukocytosis, anemia, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Imaging studies, such as MRI and FDG PET/CT, can be helpful in diagnosing LCH and determining the extent of disease. The gold standard for diagnosis is a biopsy of affected tissue, which shows characteristic histopathologic features of LCH.

The treatment of LCH depends on the stage of disease and the organs involved. For localized disease, treatment may consist of observation, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. For more extensive disease, treatment may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and bone marrow transplantation.

The prognosis for LCH is generally good, with most patients achieving long-term remission. However, some patients may experience long-term sequelae, such as growth retardation, osteoporosis, and hypothyroidism.

The diagnosis is Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH).

 20%|█▉        | 302/1525 [1:10:54<5:22:26, 15.82s/it]Reasoning: The patient has a history of ROS1-rearranged lung adenocarcinoma, which is a rare type of lung cancer that responds well to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as crizotinib. The patient initially responded well to treatment with ceritinib, but after switching to crizotinib, he developed a dry cough and a new consolidation lesion on chest radiography. A CT scan showed that the lesion was consistent with lymphangitic carcinomatosis, which is a type of lung cancer that spreads through the lymphatic system. However, a bronchoscopy with bronchial brushing and biopsy did not identify any cancer cells. The patient's tumor marker carcinoembryonic antigen level also decreased, which is not consistent with disease progression. These findings suggest that the patient's new symptoms may be due to TKI-induced interstitial lung disease (ILD), a side effect of TKI treatment that can cause inflammation and scarring of the lung tissue. TKI-induced ILD is a serious condition that can be fatal, but it is often reversible if the TKI is discontinued and steroid treatment is started. Therefore, the best course of action for this patient is to discontinue crizotinib and start steroid treatment. The patient should also be monitored closely for signs of disease progression, such as worsening cough, shortness of breath, or weight loss.

 20%|█▉        | 303/1525 [1:11:10<5:21:25, 15.78s/it]**Reasoning:**
The patient is a male newborn with unilateral exophthalmos and a rapidly growing parotid mass. His prenatal course was complicated by maternal drug use, hepatitis C, and lack of routine prenatal care. Intraocular pressure of the right eye was elevated to 31 mm Hg (normal pressure, <20 mm Hg). Parotid ultrasonography demonstrated a lobulated solid vascular mass measuring 2.1 cm. The infant was referred to the ophthalmology and otolaryngology service. At the age of 5 weeks, a swollen right eye with a foggy cornea and conjunctival vascular anomaly were noted. A soft, mobile, right parotid mass had doubled in size.

Ocular B-scan ultrasonography revealed a large subretinal lesion with multiple intralesional, hyperechoic foci extending temporally from the optic disc to the periphery. Results of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed an intraocular mass in the right eye, with faint contrast enhancement thought to represent intratumoral calcification or hemorrhage, and a well-circumscribed, 3.1-cm, right superficial parotid mass with faint enhancement (Figure 1). 18F-fludeoxyglucose–positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) showed hypermetabolic masses at the posterior aspect of the right globe, the lateral aspect of the orbit, and the right parotid gland. Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis provided no evidence of distant metastasis. Cerebral spinal fluid analysis and examination of a bone marrow biopsy specimen showed no suspicious findings. A pathological specimen from the parotid gland featured small blue cells with a fine chromatin granular pattern and complete loss of integrase interactor 1 (INI-1).

The differential diagnosis for a newborn with unilateral exophthalmos and a rapidly growing parotid mass includes retinoblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor, and medulloepithelioma. Retinoblastoma is a rare, malignant tumor of the retina that occurs most commonly in children under the age of 2 years. It is typically bilateral, although unilateral cases do occur. Rhabdomyosarcoma is a soft tissue sarcoma that can occur in any part of the body, but is most common in the head and neck region. Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor is a rare, malignant tumor that can occur in any part of the body, but is most common in the brain and spinal cord. Medulloepithelioma is a rare, malignant tumor of the brain that occurs most commonly in children under the age of 5 years.

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is rhabdomyosarcoma. This is supported by the patient's age, the location of the mass, the findings on imaging studies, and the pathological findings. Retinoblastoma is less likely because the tumor is unilateral and the patient is older than the typical age for presentation. Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor is also less likely because the tumor is not located in the brain. Medulloepithelioma is also less likely because the tumor is not located in the brain and the patient is older than the typical age for presentation.

 20%|█▉        | 304/1525 [1:11:27<5:25:59, 16.02s/it]The correct answer is: **D. Stop ranitidine due to concern for reduced gastrointestinal magnesium absorption.**

Reasoning:

The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes, atrial fibrillation, hypothyroidism, and hypertension. She is taking several medications, including liraglutide, metformin, apixaban, sotalol, metoprolol, levothyroxine, venlafaxine, lisinopril, and ranitidine. Her prior serum magnesium levels ranged from 1.4 mg/dL to 1.6 mg/dL and a recent hemoglobin A1c level was 10.8%. Following baseline blood testing, the patient collected a 24-hour urine sample after discontinuing magnesium supplements for 24 hours.

The patient's hypomagnesemia is likely due to a combination of factors, including her medications, her diabetes, and her poor glycemic control. Ranitidine is a medication that can reduce gastrointestinal magnesium absorption. In this patient, stopping ranitidine is likely to improve her magnesium levels.

The other options are not as likely to be effective in this patient. Alcoholism is a possible cause of hypomagnesemia, but the patient does not have a history of alcoholism. Improving glycemic control is important for overall health, but it is not likely to improve the patient's hypomagnesemia. Starting insulin is not necessary in this patient, as she is already taking metformin and liraglutide. Insulin does not promote magnesium reabsorption at the proximal convoluted tubule.

Therefore, the best course of action is to stop ranitidine. This is likely to improve the patient's magnesium levels and resolve her hypomagnesemia.

 20%|██        | 305/1525 [1:11:40<5:11:22, 15.31s/it]The patient is a 48-year-old man with a history of rectal adenocarcinoma (cT3N2bM0) diagnosed 9 years prior. Following neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, low anterior resection, and 6 cycles of adjuvant FOLFOX therapy (fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin), he had developed a lung metastasis (KRAS wild type) 1 year later. He subsequently developed multiple lung metastases treated with palliative local interventions (lobectomy, radiofrequency ablation) and 4 lines of chemotherapy. Owing to symptomatic lung disease, he was enrolled in a clinical trial (NCT03502733) following informed consent and achieved a confirmed partial response. After 9 months, contrast computed tomography restaging scans noted a new, 1-cm posterior subglottic lesion of unclear origin. He had no shortness of breath or noisy breathing, dysphagia, voice change, or hemoptysis. A partial response was maintained without evidence of progression of lung disease.

The differential diagnosis based on imaging included a mass vs inspissated mucus. Examination using distal-chip flexible laryngoscopy revealed a 1-cm, broad-based, exophytic mass along the posterior wall of the subglottis with prominent vasculature. No other anatomic abnormalities in the upper aerodigestive tract or cervical lymphadenopathy were noted. The decision was made to proceed to the operating room for definitive endoscopic biopsy under general anesthesia. Examination revealed a subglottic mass that did not extend inferiorly beyond the caudal aspect of the cricoid cartilage. The mass was debulked and sent to pathology for analysis, including hematoxylin-eosin and immunohistochemical staining.

The histopathology report showed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with a positive CDX2 stain, consistent with metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma.

The patient was subsequently started on systemic chemotherapy for his metastatic disease. He tolerated treatment well and had no further progression of his disease at 6 months follow-up.

**Reasoning:**

The patient's history of rectal adenocarcinoma and lung metastases makes metastatic disease to the subglottis the most likely diagnosis. The presence of a subglottic mass on imaging and the absence of other anatomic abnormalities in the upper aerodigestive tract or cervical lymphadenopathy further support this diagnosis. The histopathology report showing a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with a positive CDX2 stain provides definitive diagnosis.

 20%|██        | 306/1525 [1:11:57<5:17:10, 15.61s/it]Reasoning: The patient is a 27-year-old woman with a history of heroin use who presented with syncope. She denied prodromal symptoms and reported this was her first syncopal episode. She reported a few episodes of dizziness in the couple days prior to presentation but denied chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, or the recent use of illicit drugs or new medications. Shortly after arrival at the emergency department, she had a 50-second run of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Her vital signs and the results of her physical examination were normal. Troponin levels, thyroid levels, and the results of a complete blood cell count and metabolic panel were all normal. The results of imaging studies, including echocardiography, computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography, and brain CT, were also unremarkable. Coronary angiography found no evidence of obstructive coronary disease. The results of the urine toxicology test were negative. An initial electrocardiogram (ECG) at presentation was reviewed (Figure).

The patient's history and presentation are concerning for a cardiac arrhythmia. The polymorphic ventricular tachycardia that she experienced shortly after arrival at the emergency department is a serious arrhythmia that can lead to sudden cardiac death. The patient's ECG at presentation shows a prolonged QT interval, which is a risk factor for ventricular arrhythmias.

The next step in the management of this patient is to perform treadmill stress testing for evaluation of inherited arrhythmias. This test will help to determine if the patient has an arrhythmia that is triggered by exercise. If the patient does have an arrhythmia that is triggered by exercise, she will need to be treated with medications or an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.

The patient's history of generalized weakness, increased sweating, severe nausea, and vomiting, followed by lethargy, vomiting, and urinary incontinence, is consistent with a toxin exposure. The patient's stuporous state on arrival to the emergency department and her need for intubation suggest a severe toxin exposure. The patient's laboratory tests showed a normal anion gap, which is not consistent with methanol poisoning. The patient's electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia at 53 bpm and borderline QT interval prolongation (QTc; 465 milliseconds), which is consistent with carbon monoxide poisoning. The patient's urine toxicology screen had negative results for acetaminophen, salicylates, opiates, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, and ethanol. The patient's cerebrospinal fluid was clear, with normal levels of glucose, total protein, and white blood cells and negative microbiology and cytology testing results. A malaria smear and antigen test, respiratory viral assay, and cultures of cerebrospinal fluid, blood, and urine had negative results. The patient's computed tomography of the head showed bilateral hyperdensity of the globus pallidi, which is consistent with carbon monoxide poisoning.

However, she has no history of glaucoma, and her intraocular pressure is well-controlled. The most likely explanation for her visual field defects is a congenital defect. In this case, the best course of action is to monitor the patient closely with serial examinations and repeated visual field testing. This will allow the physician to determine if the visual field defects are stable or progressive. If they are progressive, then further treatment may be necessary. However, if they are stable, then the patient may not need any further treatment.

 20%|██        | 309/1525 [1:12:42<5:08:50, 15.24s/it]**Reasoning:** The patient is a woman in her early 70s with a solitary, asymptomatic lump on her scalp. She was born with the lesion but noticed some growth following a minor local trauma a couple of months prior to seeking medical evaluation. The patient denied local inflammation, purulent discharge, and systemic symptoms. Her medical history was unremarkable apart from an allegedly benign breast nodule resection in her teenage years. In addition, her father died of metastatic cutaneous melanoma at 83 years old.

Clinically, there was an ill-defined, infiltrated plaque with a normochromic, exophytic nodule on her scalp vertex measuring 4.2 × 3.8 cm. It had a waxy surface with irregular transverse furrows and overlying alopecia. Dermoscopic evaluation findings revealed a homogeneous yellow hue with no visible vascular or pigmented structures and absence of follicular ostia. The lesion was firm and mildly tender to the touch and seemed adherent to the underlying bone. There were no palpable lymph nodes. A brain magnetic resonance imaging was performed for further elucidation, as well as a punch biopsy.

The brain MRI showed a well-circumscribed, non-enhancing mass in the right parietal lobe. The punch biopsy showed cellular infiltration in the reticular dermis with monomorphic cells in a syncytial configuration surrounding collagen bundles.

The most likely diagnosis is a proliferative nodule in a congenital melanocytic nevus. This is a benign condition that can occur in patients with a history of congenital melanocytic nevi. The clinical features of this condition are consistent with the patient's history and physical examination findings. The brain MRI findings are also consistent with a proliferative nodule in a congenital melanocytic nevus. The punch biopsy findings are also consistent with this diagnosis.

The other possible diagnoses are chondroid syringoma, cutaneous meningeal heterotopia, and scalp metastasis. Chondroid syringoma is a rare, benign tumor that typically occurs in the skin of the hands and feet. Cutaneous meningeal heterotopia is a rare condition in which meningeal tissue is found in the skin. Scalp metastasis is a rare condition in which cancer cells from another part of the body spread to the scalp.

The patient has a 25-year history of bulimia and is purging almost daily. She reported an inability to go more than 3 days at a time without purging and noted a reduction in the pressure and size of her lesions with respite from these daily episodes. This suggests that the lesions may be related to her bulimia and may improve with treatment of her eating disorder. Therefore, the best course of action is to observe the lesions while she continues psychiatric treatment.

 20%|██        | 311/1525 [1:13:10<4:53:01, 14.48s/it]**Reasoning:** The patient is a 67-year-old Asian woman with a history of swelling of the left upper eyelid that was initially treated with surgical drainage. The swelling persisted, and two months later, the patient developed nontender preauricular fullness. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed focal enhancement in the left upper eyelid and superficial lobe of the left parotid gland. The patient was referred to an ophthalmologist for diagnosis and treatment.

On examination, the patient's visual acuity was 20/20 in the right eye and 20/30 in the left eye. Ocular motility was full, and proptosis was absent. The left upper eyelid was thickened, and eyelid eversion was not possible because of mass effect. A small portion of the tumor was visualized at the supranasal eyelid margin. All eyelashes were intact. A nontender left preauricular mass of 1 cm in diameter was palpable. The remainder of the findings on eye examination were unremarkable. After eyelid eversion in the operating room, the mass measured 35 mm in basal diameter and 5 mm in thickness. The mass had an amelanotic appearance with a hairpin-shaped vascular pattern suggestive of an epithelial tumor.

The differential diagnosis for a mass in the upper eyelid includes basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, sebaceous carcinoma, and lymphoma. Based on the patient's history, examination findings, and imaging studies, the most likely diagnosis is basal cell carcinoma.

Basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer. It is a slow-growing, non-metastasizing tumor that typically arises on sun-exposed skin. The most common presentation of basal cell carcinoma is a small, raised, pearly papule with telangiectasias. Treatment for basal cell carcinoma typically involves surgical excision.

In this case, the patient has a large, invasive basal cell carcinoma of the upper eyelid. The tumor is extending into the orbit and parotid gland. Based on the patient's age and medical history, she is at high risk for recurrence of the tumor if it is not treated aggressively.

The best treatment for this patient is a complete posterior lamellar resection. This procedure involves removing the entire tumor, including the underlying orbicularis oculi muscle and the tarsus. The defect is then reconstructed with a skin graft or a local flap.

A: Administer topical interferon alfa-2b is not the best treatment for this patient. Interferon alfa-2b is a cytokine that has anti-tumor activity. It is used to treat a variety of cancers, including basal cell carcinoma. However, interferon alfa-2b is not as effective as surgery in treating basal cell carcinoma of the eyelid. Additionally, interferon alfa-2b can cause significant side effects, including fatigue, flu-like symptoms, and hair loss.

B: Start external beam radiotherapy is not the best treatment for this patient. External beam radiotherapy is a type of radiation therapy that is used to treat cancer. It is effective in treating basal cell carcinoma of the eyelid. However, external beam radiotherapy can cause significant side effects, including dry eyes, skin changes, and radiation-induced tumors.

C: Administer intralesional fluorouracil is not the best treatment for this patient. Intralesional fluorouracil is a chemotherapy drug that is injected directly into a tumor. It is effective in treating basal cell carcinoma of the eyelid. However, intralesional fluorouracil can cause significant side effects, including pain, inflammation, and necrosis.

D: Perform a complete posterior lamellar resection is the best treatment for this patient. A complete posterior lamellar resection is a surgical procedure that is used to remove a basal cell carcinoma of the eyelid. It is a safe and effective procedure that has a low risk of recurrence.

The patient is a woman in her 50s with a recent diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (subtype M5a, French-American-British classification) who was admitted to the hospital for induction chemotherapy. At presentation she had a 3-week history of a striking pruritic and generalized cutaneous eruption. The patient otherwise felt well and denied fever, malaise, insect bites, or starting new drug treatments. Except for leukopenia and a slightly elevated C-reactive protein level, results of other routine blood and urine tests were unremarkable. Physical examination revealed an erythematous eruption composed of small indurated and edematous papules (Figure, A and B). Confluent papules leading to large urticariform plaques, some with annular configuration, were present on the flanks, lower legs, breasts, and scalp. Hyperpigmented patches and focal areas of bruiselike discoloration were seen adjacent to acute lesions. Mucous membranes, palms, and soles were spared. A biopsy specimen was obtained (Figure, C and D).

The differential diagnosis for a generalized pruritic eruption includes a wide range of conditions, both benign and malignant. In this case, the patient's history of acute myeloid leukemia, the presence of a cutaneous eruption, and the findings on physical examination and biopsy are all consistent with a diagnosis of eosinophilic dermatosis of hematologic malignancy. This is a rare disorder that typically occurs in patients with hematologic malignancies, such as leukemia or lymphoma. The eruption is characterized by the presence of pruritic, erythematous papules and plaques that may coalesce to form large urticariform lesions. The lesions are often associated with hyperpigmentation and bruiselike discoloration. Histologically, the eruption is characterized by a perivascular and interstitial infiltrate of eosinophils.

The treatment of eosinophilic dermatosis of hematologic malignancy is aimed at the underlying hematologic malignancy. In addition, topical corticosteroids or systemic immunosuppressive agents may be used to control the cutaneous eruption.

She is somnolent and confused without focal neurologic deficits. Serum white blood cell count is elevated to 14.9 ×109/L. A computed tomography scan of her brain shows diffuse ventriculomegaly and sulcal effacement consistent with hydrocephalus and cerebral edema. A ventriculostomy is placed emergently. Laboratory analysis of cerebrospinal fluid shows 40 red blood cells/mm3; 3 nucleated cells/mm3; protein level, 11 mg/dL; and glucose level, 73 mg/dL. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain with and without contrast shows ventriculomegaly of the lateral and third ventricles, with a 0.4 × 0.4 × 0.6–cm nonenhancing lesion obstructing the aqueduct of Sylvius. No abnormal meningeal enhancement or parenchymal lesion is identified. On hospital day 5, in the midst of an ongoing infectious diseases workup, the measured intracranial pressure and rate of CSF drainage from the ventriculostomy suddenly decrease. Repeat MRI demonstrates resolved hydrocephalus, a patent aqueduct of Sylvius, and the aforementioned nonenhancing lesion now located in the fourth ventricle.

The most likely diagnosis is a parasitic infection of the central nervous system, such as neurocysticercosis. Neurocysticercosis is a common parasitic infection of the central nervous system caused by the larvae of the pork tapeworm Taenia solium. The infection is acquired by ingestion of eggs from the tapeworm, which are shed in the feces of an infected person. The eggs hatch in the small intestine and the larvae migrate to the brain, where they form cysts. The cysts can cause a variety of symptoms, including headache, seizures, and hydrocephalus.

The treatment for neurocysticercosis is a combination of anthelminthic therapy and steroids. Anthelminthic therapy kills the larvae of the tapeworm. Steroids reduce inflammation and swelling in the brain.

In this case, the patient has already been started on anthelminthic therapy. The next step is to monitor the patient's clinical status and repeat MRI scans to assess the response to therapy. If the patient's symptoms improve and the cysts resolve, then the patient can be discharged from the hospital. However, if the patient's symptoms worsen or the cysts do not resolve, then the patient may need to undergo surgery to remove the cysts.

The patient is a 70-year-old man with a history of hypertension and obstructive sleep apnea who presents with a 2-year history of nasal congestion, persistent rhinorrhea, postnasal drip, and chronic cough. Over the same period, he also developed thickened, brittle, and discolored fingernails and toenails. More recently, he developed progressive exertional dyspnea and edema of both lower extremities. He had no joint pain or swelling and no chest pain. He was taking amlodipine (5 mg daily) and ipratropium bromide nasal spray twice daily.

On examination, he was afebrile. Heart rate was 66/min; blood pressure, 132/72 mm Hg; respiratory rate, 18/min; and oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry, 97% on room air. He had yellow discoloration and thickening of his fingernails and toenails (Figure 1A). A few nails showed distal onycholysis. He had partially nonpitting edema of the lower extremities (Figure 1B). Auscultation revealed diminished breath sounds at the lung bases but no rhonchi or crackles. Percussion of the lung bases and vocal resonance were normal. Cardiac and abdominal examination findings were unremarkable.

Laboratory testing revealed normal complete blood cell count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and thyrotropin level. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 2 mm/h; C-reactive protein level was 0.1 mg/dL. Antinuclear antibody (ANA) was positive (1:160, nucleolar pattern), but results of testing for antibodies to extractable nuclear antigens and double-stranded DNA were negative. He had mildly low C3 complement level (63 mg/dL [reference range, 79-152 mg/dL]), but normal C4 complement level (20 mg/dL [reference range, 16-38 mg/dL]). Immunoglobulin levels were normal. A chest radiograph performed within the last 6 months to evaluate his chronic cough did not reveal any obvious cardiopulmonary disease. His electrocardiogram was normal. An echocardiogram revealed normal left and right ventricular systolic and diastolic function and a small to moderate pericardial effusion without evidence of tamponade. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the sinuses showed bilateral maxillary and posterior ethmoidal sinusitis.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to order measurement of serum ferritin level, serum iron level, and serum total iron-binding capacity. These tests will help to assess for iron deficiency, which is a common cause of nail changes.

The patient is a 72-year-old man with recently diagnosed metastatic appendiceal adenocarcinoma undergoing chemotherapy with capecitabine plus oxaliplatin. He presents with lower abdominal pain and watery, large-volume diarrhea up to 15 times per day for the previous 3 weeks. His diarrhea is nonbloody, woke him up from sleep, was accompanied by crampy abdominal pain, and was not associated with nausea or vomiting. The diarrhea persisted despite treatment with combinations of loperamide, atropine/diphenoxylate, colestipol, and tincture of opium. He required repeated intravenous infusions for fluid and electrolyte repletion. His physical examination results revealed normal vital signs and a mildly tender abdomen with hyperactive bowel sounds, but no peritoneal signs. His laboratory workup results were notable for severe hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, as well as positive fecal lactoferrin and elevated fecal calprotectin levels of 646 μg/g. His infectious workup results were unremarkable. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen/pelvis revealed diffuse long-segment wall thickening involving nearly the entire terminal ileum. An ileocolonoscopy revealed erythematous and congested mucosa with scattered erosions and ulcerations throughout the examined terminal ileum. Targeted biopsies were obtained.

The most likely diagnosis is **C:** ileal metastasis. The patient has a history of metastatic appendiceal adenocarcinoma, and the diarrhea is associated with other features of metastatic disease, such as hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and elevated fecal calprotectin levels. The computed tomography scan and colonoscopy findings are also consistent with metastatic disease.

Cytomegalovirus ileitis is a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's history and the lack of other features of infection, such as fever, leukocytosis, and elevated inflammatory markers. Capecitabine-induced terminal ileitis is also a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's history and the lack of other features of chemotherapy toxicity, such as mucositis, diarrhea, and hand-foot syndrome. Small bowel carcinoid tumor is a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's history and the lack of other features of carcinoid syndrome, such as flushing, diarrhea, and wheezing.

Visual field (VF) testing as well as ganglion cell layer (GCL) segmentation by optical coherence tomography (OCT) were obtained for both eyes, and show nasal thinning of the right eye and diffuse thinning of the left eye. These findings suggest that the patient is experiencing progressive vision loss due to glaucoma.

The next step in management is to refer the patient to a retina specialist for further evaluation and treatment.

He also noted a history of substantial blood glucose elevation after taking oral prednisone. These medical conditions increase the risk of developing complications from scleritis, such as retinal detachment. The patient's symptoms of severe, progressive pain, redness, and decreased visual acuity in the left eye are consistent with scleritis. The physical examination findings of marked inferior redness, including large-caliber episcleral vessels and scleral thinning that was greatest inferonasally, an epithelial defect overlying the thinned sclera, scleral tenderness to palpation, 16 to 25 cells per high-power field in the anterior chamber, and iris neovascularization are also consistent with scleritis. The B-scan ultrasonographic image of the left eye shows an inferior retinal detachment. This is a serious complication of scleritis that can lead to blindness if not treated.

The patient is a man in his 40s who presented with mobility of the anterior mandibular dentition. A consultation with a dentist 1 year prior revealed an impacted mandibular canine (No. 22). He denied any pain, swelling, or paresthesia, and his medical history was unremarkable. Clinical examination revealed fullness on the mentolabial fold but no gross facial asymmetry or mental nerve paresthesia. Intraorally, there was an expansile mass of the left anterior mandible with ill-defined margins, which crossed the midline and obliterated the gingivolabial sulcus.

Results of dental cone beam computed tomography imaging revealed a 4.3 × 4.0-cm radiolucent mandibular lesion with an unerupted mandibular canine in the center of the lesion, cortical destruction, and root deviation of teeth Nos. 23 through 26. An incisional biopsy was performed, and the patient underwent radical mandibular resection 2 months later. Histological sections from the resection demonstrated nests and cords of polygonal cells with clear to eosinophilic cytoplasm embedded in a dense collagenous stroma. The lesion was centered in the cortical bone and extended into the surrounding mucosa, fibroadipose tissue, and skeletal muscle. Perineural invasion was identified, and lymphovascular invasion was absent. The tumor involved multiple margins. Immunohistochemistry findings revealed the tumor cells were positive for p40. Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies demonstrated an EWSR1 gene rearrangement in 60% of the tumor cells.

Based on the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and histopathological results, the most likely diagnosis is clear cell odontogenic carcinoma. Clear cell odontogenic carcinoma is a rare, aggressive malignant neoplasm that arises from the odontogenic epithelium. It is characterized by nests and cords of polygonal cells with clear to eosinophilic cytoplasm. The tumor is often locally destructive and may metastasize to the lungs, liver, and lymph nodes. The treatment of clear cell odontogenic carcinoma is surgical resection with or without adjuvant radiation therapy.

The patient is a woman in her 70s who presented with an enlarged and variegated plaque on her left axilla, which she had had for 4 years. The lesion started as a small eczematous, pink-to-brown plaque. As the lesion was asymptomatic and slow growing, she did not initially seek treatment. Recently, the color of the lesion had changed to an alarming dark brown color. No breast mass or lymphadenopathy was observed. Her medical and family history was unremarkable. A skin biopsy specimen was obtained and submitted for further histopathologic analysis.

The histopathologic findings revealed an intraepidermal neoplasm consisting of pagetoid cells, characterized by round, pale, vacuolated cytoplasm, and large pleomorphic nuclei. Immunohistochemical findings showed positive staining for EMA. The lesion was surrounded by numerous reactive dendritic HMB-45–positive melanocytes scattered among the tumor cells.

Based on the clinical presentation, histopathologic findings, and immunohistochemical findings, the most likely diagnosis is pigmented extramammary Paget disease (PEMP). PEMP is a rare skin cancer that typically affects the anogenital region, but it can also occur in other areas of the body, such as the axilla. The typical presentation of PEMP is a slowly growing, pigmented plaque. The lesion is often eczematous or verrucous in appearance. PEMP is a locally aggressive tumor, but it rarely metastasizes. The treatment of PEMP is surgical excision.

The patient is a middle-aged man with a 3-month history of an asymptomatic nodule on his scalp. There are no systemic complaints, history of arthropod bite, immunosuppression, travel abroad, or contact with animals in the recent past. Physical examination reveals a skin-colored, firm, nontender, freely mobile 2 × 1.5-cm nodule with overlying normal skin on the right occipital region of the scalp. There is no lymphadenopathy. No other cutaneous lesions are present.

The histopathologic examination of the nodule reveals a nodule in the dermis with an unremarkable epidermis. Cross-sections of parasites are present, surrounded by a fibrous capsule. The parasite shows an outer cuticle, muscle layer underneath, and gravid uterus filled with microfilariae. The cuticle demonstrates a wavy pattern of longitudinal ridges on its outer surface. The fibrous capsule contains mixed inflammatory infiltrate of lymphocytes, eosinophils, histiocytes, and plasma cells. Findings of slitlamp examination and fundoscopy of the eyes are normal. Findings of routine hematologic and biochemical investigations are normal. No microfilaria was seen in peripheral blood. Findings of chest radiography and abdomen ultrasonography are unremarkable.

The most likely diagnosis is subcutaneous dirofilariasis. Dirofilariasis is a parasitic infection caused by the nematode Dirofilaria immitis. The parasite is transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito. The most common site of infection is the subcutaneous tissue, but the parasite can also infect the eyes, heart, and lungs. The clinical manifestations of subcutaneous dirofilariasis vary depending on the site of infection. In the subcutaneous tissue, the infection is usually asymptomatic and the nodule is the only finding. In the eyes, the infection can cause uveitis, keratitis, and retinal detachment. In the heart, the infection can cause cardiomyopathy and heart failure. In the lungs, the infection can cause pneumonia and pulmonary embolism.

The diagnosis of subcutaneous dirofilariasis is made by histopathologic examination of the nodule. The characteristic finding is the presence of cross-sections of the parasite in the dermis. The parasite is a large, white nematode with a thick cuticle. The cuticle has a wavy pattern of longitudinal ridges on its outer surface. The parasite has a muscle layer underneath and a gravid uterus filled with microfilariae.

The treatment of subcutaneous dirofilariasis is surgical excision of the nodule. The nodule should be excised with a margin of normal tissue. The patient should also be treated with antiparasitic medication, such as ivermectin or diethylcarbamazine.

He was treated with oral antibiotics and steroids, but his symptoms recurred. He then developed a saddle-shaped deformity on his nose and difficulty breathing when he laid supine. Physical examination revealed a saddle-nose deformity, left pinna perichondritis, and a soft inspiratory stridor. Laboratory tests showed elevated C-reactive protein levels, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and a microcytic hypochromic anemia. Antinuclear antibody, anti–double-stranded DNA, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative.

The differential diagnosis includes relapsing polychondritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and sarcoidosis. Relapsing polychondritis is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation of cartilage throughout the body. It most commonly affects the ears, nose, and joints. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a systemic vasculitis that can affect the lungs, kidneys, heart, and other organs. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by inflammation of the blood vessels, lungs, and other organs. Sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect any organ in the body.

The patient's history and physical examination findings are most consistent with relapsing polychondritis. The elevated C-reactive protein levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are consistent with inflammation. The microcytic hypochromic anemia is likely secondary to chronic inflammation. The negative results for antinuclear antibody, anti–double-stranded DNA, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies help to rule out other autoimmune disorders.

The patient is a 60-year-old African American woman with a 1-day history of new floaters in her right eye. She has no relevant medical history, was not taking any systemic or ocular medications, and denied a history of floaters. Her visual acuity was 20/40 OU, and her intraocular pressure was 18 mm Hg OU. An anterior segment examination was unremarkable in both eyes. Ophthalmoscopy findings were notable for a vitreous hemorrhage in the right eye. Salmon-patch intraretinal hemorrhages were noted in the temporal peripheral retina of both eyes (Figure 1). Widefield fluorescein angiography revealed retinal capillary nonperfusion of the peripheral retina with neovascularization elsewhere, in a sea fan–like pattern, in both eyes. The patient denied any known history of sickle cell disease or trait and any family history of sickle disease. Scatter laser photocoagulation was performed on the nonperfused temporal retina in the right eye, and the left eye was observed.

The most likely diagnosis is sickle cell retinopathy. Sickle cell retinopathy is a complication of sickle cell disease that occurs when abnormal hemoglobin causes red blood cells to become rigid and sickle-shaped. These sickle cells can block blood flow to the retina, leading to ischemia and neovascularization. Neovascularization is the growth of new blood vessels from the choroid (the vascular layer of the eye) into the retina. These new blood vessels are fragile and can bleed, leading to vitreous hemorrhage.

The treatment for sickle cell retinopathy is aimed at preventing further vision loss. This includes scatter laser photocoagulation to the areas of nonperfusion and panretinal photocoagulation to the entire retina. These procedures destroy the nonperfused retina and prevent the growth of new blood vessels. In some cases, vitreous hemorrhage may require vitrectomy to remove the blood and improve vision.

In the case of this patient, she is a 60-year-old African American woman with a 1-day history of new floaters in her right eye. She has no relevant medical history, was not taking any systemic or ocular medications, and denied a history of floaters. Her visual acuity was 20/40 OU, and her intraocular pressure was 18 mm Hg OU.

 21%|██        | 323/1525 [1:16:18<5:14:20, 15.69s/it]The correct answer is: **D. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis**.

Reasoning:

* The patient is a 9-year-old boy with a history of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and β-thalassemia trait. Both parents had a history of latent tuberculosis infection treated after immigrating to the US from Syria shortly after the patient’s birth.
* The patient presented with 1 month of progressive dyspnea, snoring, dysphagia, and weight loss.
* He was referred to the otolaryngology clinic, where flexible laryngoscopy revealed diffuse upper airway lymphoid hyperplasia and supraglottic edema.
* He was sent to the emergency department, where he was stridulous and afebrile with a normal white blood cell count and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate.
* A computed tomography scan of the neck revealed diffuse edema and contrast enhancement of the nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and supraglottis.
* A chest radiograph was normal.
* The patient was taken urgently to the operating room for direct microlaryngoscopy and intubated.
* Results of biopsies and cultures of the tonsils, adenoids, and supraglottis revealed diffuse non-necrotizing granulomas and oropharyngeal flora with negative acid-fast bacilli and Grocott methenamine silver stains.
* He remained intubated, and treatment with systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics was initiated.
* During this time, he had a normal angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level and normal titers for antinuclear antibody (ANA), cytoplasmic antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody, perinuclear antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody, antimyeloperoxidase antibody, antiproteinase 3 antibody, anti–double-stranded DNA antibody, Smith antibody, Sjogren antibodies, and histoplasma antibodies.
* He also had normal results on tuberculin purified protein derivative and interferon-γ release assay (QuantiFERON; Qiagen).

Based on the above information, the most likely diagnosis is granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). GPA is a rare, systemic vasculitis that can affect any organ system, but most commonly the kidneys, lungs, and upper airway. The characteristic pathologic finding in GPA is the presence of non-necrotizing granulomas. The clinical presentation of GPA is variable, but can include fever, weight loss, arthralgias, myalgias, cough, hemoptysis, and sinusitis. The diagnosis of GPA is made based on clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. Treatment for GPA typically consists of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents.

The other possible diagnoses in this case include tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, and epiglottitis. Tuberculosis is a chronic infection caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The most common presentation of tuberculosis is pulmonary tuberculosis, but extrapulmonary tuberculosis can also occur. The diagnosis of tuberculosis is made based on clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. Treatment for tuberculosis typically consists of a combination of antibiotics. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder of unknown etiology. The most common presentation of sarcoidosis is pulmonary sarcoidosis, but extrapulmonary sarcoidosis can also occur. The diagnosis of sarcoidosis is made based on clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. Treatment for sarcoidosis typically consists of corticosteroids. Epiglottitis is a bacterial infection of the epiglottis. The most common presentation of epiglottitis is a sudden onset of fever, sore throat, dysphagia, and stridor. The diagnosis of epiglottitis is made based on clinical findings. Treatment for epiglottitis typically consists of intubation and antibiotics.

In this case, the patient's history of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and β-thalassemia trait, as well as the presence of non-necrotizing granulomas on biopsy, are consistent with a diagnosis of GPA. The other possible diagnoses are less likely based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory tests.

The patient is a 4-year-old girl with an asymptomatic, unilateral retinal mass. The mass is white and located superonasally in the right eye. There is no visible calcification or subretinal fluid. The optic disc and posterior pole are normal in the right eye. The left posterior segment is normal.

The differential diagnosis for a retinal mass includes retinoblastoma, astrocytoma, and hemangioma. Retinoblastoma is the most common type of retinal tumor in children. It is a malignant tumor that can spread to the brain and other parts of the body. Astrocytoma is a type of brain tumor that can also occur in the retina. Hemangioma is a benign tumor that is made up of blood vessels.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to obtain an examination under anesthesia (EUA) with ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The EUA will allow the doctor to directly visualize the mass and obtain a biopsy if necessary. The ultrasonography will help to determine the size and location of the mass. The MRI will help to determine the extent of the mass and whether it has spread to other parts of the body.

If the mass is found to be retinoblastoma, the patient will need to undergo treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. If the mass is found to be astrocytoma or hemangioma, the patient may only need to undergo observation.

The patient has a mobile intracardiac mass on her tricuspid valve. This could be a thrombus, a tumor, or an infection. A thrombus is a blood clot that can form in the heart and travel to the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism. A tumor could be a primary cardiac tumor or a metastasis from another cancer. An infection could be caused by bacteria or fungi.

The next step in management is to determine the cause of the mass. This can be done with a positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT) scan. A PET-CT scan is a type of imaging test that uses a radioactive tracer to look for areas of abnormal activity in the body. If the mass is a thrombus, the patient will likely need anticoagulation therapy to prevent it from traveling to the lungs. If the mass is a tumor, the patient may need surgery to remove it. If the mass is an infection, the patient will likely need antibiotics.

The patient is a 56-year-old woman with stable atypical chest pain. She has a 20% pretest probability of coronary artery disease (CAD). Functional tests performed 3 months earlier were inconclusive. The patient has cardiovascular risk factors including arterial hypertension and a family history of CAD. With antihypertensive therapy, her blood pressure is 119/79 mm Hg. Blood lipids were as follows: total cholesterol, 167 mg/dL (abnormal >200 mg/dL); low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 80 mg/dL (abnormal >100 mg/dL); high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, 55 mg/dL (abnormal <60 mg/dL); and triglycerides, 80 mg/dL (abnormal >150 mg/dL). To evaluate for CAD, she underwent coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography, which showed no coronary stenosis.

The next step in management is to determine whether the patient needs further testing. The patient's symptoms are atypical, and she has a low pretest probability of CAD. The CT angiography showed no coronary stenosis, which is a strong negative predictor of CAD. Therefore, further testing is not necessary.

Answer:
C. No stenosis or plaque. Because of high negative predictive value, no further testing is necessary.

The arthritis is predominantly in the knee, shoulder, and hip, and the skin lesions are predominantly on the legs. The patient also has a history of pancreatitis. Laboratory test results reveal strikingly high levels of lipase and amylase, as well as normal levels of cancer antigen 19-9. Bone CT of the right shoulder and knee demonstrate cortical bone destruction and intraosseous medullary necrosis. An abdominal CT was performed, and the patient underwent surgery.

The most likely diagnosis is cancer-associated pancreatitis, panniculitis, and polyarthritis syndrome (PPP) syndrome. PPP syndrome is a rare, multisystem disorder characterized by pancreatitis, panniculitis, and polyarthritis. The syndrome is associated with a variety of malignancies, including pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, and lung cancer.

The patient is a teenage girl newly diagnosed with idiopathic intracranial hypertension by her neurologist. She presents with 2 weeks of headaches, dizziness, and blurred vision. Her best-corrected visual acuity is 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS. There is no afferent pupillary defect, her Ishihara color plate findings are 10/10, and extraocular movements are intact in both eyes. An anterior slitlamp examination had unremarkable findings. A fundus examination showed hemorrhagic optic disc edema, peripapillary and subfoveal subretinal fluid, tortuous and dilated retinal vasculature, many intraretinal hemorrhages in all 4 quadrants, and far peripheral temporal inner retinal whitening in both eyes (Figure 1A). Optical coherence tomography demonstrated peripapillary and subfoveal subretinal fluid, intraretinal fluid, and swollen optic nerve heads in both eyes (Figure 1B). A fluorescein angiogram showed markedly delayed venous filling (1 minute) in all quadrants and far peripheral capillary nonperfusion in both eyes.

The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are consistent with the diagnosis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). IIH is a rare disorder characterized by elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) in the absence of a structural cause. The most common symptoms of IIH are headache, nausea, vomiting, and blurred vision. Visual loss is the most serious complication of IIH and can be permanent if not treated.

The mainstay of treatment for IIH is to lower the ICP. This can be done with a variety of methods, including weight loss, diuretics, and optic nerve sheath fenestration. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove excess cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).

The patient in this case has severe IIH with optic nerve edema and visual loss. She is at high risk for further visual loss if the ICP is not lowered promptly. The most effective treatment for IIH-related visual loss is plasmapheresis. Plasmapheresis is a procedure that removes plasma from the blood and replaces it with fresh frozen plasma. This procedure has been shown to be effective in lowering the ICP and improving vision in patients with IIH.

Therefore, the best course of action for this patient is to advise urgent plasmapheresis in consultation with oncology.

The patient is a 73-year-old woman with a history of chronic cervical neck pain who presents with complaints of globus sensation, dysphagia, and localized throat swelling. On examination, she has an approximately 1.5-cm mucosally covered mass on her left lateral pharyngeal wall that is cystlike in appearance. The remainder of her examination findings are normal. The patient reports that this cyst had been drained 2 years before with resolution of her symptoms. Contrasted computed tomographic (CT) imaging of her head and neck reveals a pharyngeal cyst that extends to the atlantoaxial joint. Further magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the area demonstrates communication of the cyst with the atlantoaxial joint.

The most likely diagnosis is a Tornwaldt cyst. Tornwaldt cysts are rare, congenital anomalies that arise from remnants of the notochord. They are typically located in the posterior pharyngeal wall, near the atlantoaxial joint. Symptoms of Tornwaldt cysts can include neck pain, dysphagia, globus sensation, and otalgia. On examination, a mass may be palpable in the posterior pharyngeal wall. Imaging studies, such as CT or MRI, can confirm the diagnosis. Treatment of Tornwaldt cysts is generally not necessary unless symptoms are severe. In some cases, cysts may be drained or surgically removed.

The patient is a 72-year-old White woman who is experiencing episodes of nontraumatic transient vision loss for 2 weeks. On examination, visual acuity is 20/30 OU. Intraocular pressure (IOP) was 16 mm Hg OD and 41 mm Hg OS. The anterior segment was normal in the right eye. Anterior examination of the left eye revealed 10% hyphema. The patient was prescribed cyclopentolate, 1%, and prednisolone acetate, 1%, to reduce inflammation and lower the IOP in the left eye. Two days later, IOP was 16 mm Hg OD and 10 mm Hg OS. Slitlamp biomicroscopy revealed resolved hyphema and abnormal blood vessels at the superotemporal pupillary margin of the iris, prompting referral for further evaluation.On further examination, visual acuity was 20/40 OD and 20/50 OS, and IOP was 15 mm Hg OD and 16 mm Hg OS. Slitlamp examination results in the right eye appeared normal, whereas the left eye demonstrated subtle, multifocal ectatic vascular channels arranged circumferentially at the pupillary margin (Figure 1A, arrowheads). On fluorescein angiography (FA), both the right and left irises displayed multifocal, pinpoint areas of hyperfluorescence at the pupillary margin and was more noticeable on the left iris (Figure 1B, arrowheads). The remainder of the eye examination was unremarkable, and there was no sign of neovascularization of the retina or disc.

The most likely diagnosis is rubeosis iridis, a condition characterized by neovascularization of the iris. Rubeosis iridis can be caused by a variety of conditions, including diabetes, retinal vein occlusion, and uveitis. The most common cause of rubeosis iridis in the United States is diabetes.

The complications of rubeosis iridis include neovascular glaucoma, a type of glaucoma that is often difficult to treat. Neovascular glaucoma is caused by the growth of new blood vessels on the surface of the iris, which can block the drainage of aqueous humor from the eye. This can lead to a rapid increase in intraocular pressure, which can damage the optic nerve and cause blindness.

The treatment of rubeosis iridis depends on the underlying cause. In cases of diabetes, treatment is aimed at controlling blood sugar levels. In cases of retinal vein occlusion, treatment is aimed at restoring blood flow to the retina. In cases of uveitis, treatment is aimed at reducing inflammation.

In the case of this patient, the most likely course of treatment would be to photocoagulate the lesions with argon laser. This procedure involves using a laser to destroy the abnormal blood vessels in the iris. Photocoagulation is a safe and effective treatment for rubeosis iridis. It can help to prevent the development of neovascular glaucoma and preserve vision.

The patient is a 19-year-old White woman who presents with progressive bilateral nasal airway obstruction, crusting, and saddle nose deformity over a 6-month period. She denies systemic symptoms, including oral ulcers, sicca, photosensitivity, dermatitis, or arthralgias. Her medical history is negative for allergic rhinitis, asthma, chronic rhinosinusitis, epistaxis, nasal trauma, or surgery. Her family history is noncontributory. An in-office nasal endoscopy demonstrates synechiae bridging from the septum to the lateral nasal walls, polypoid changes, and yellow crusting bilaterally. Her immune workup shows elevated complement C3 (200 mg/dL) and total hemolytic complement (CH50; >60 U/mL) levels, with otherwise unremarkable levels of C4, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, rheumatoid factor, Sjögren antibodies, angiotensin-converting enzyme, antinuclear antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, bullous pemphigoid IgG antibodies, and quantitative immunoglobulins and IgG subclasses (IgG4, 53 mg/dL [to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 0.01]). Nasal cultures had positive results for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Bacteroides. Preoperative computed tomography showed no evidence of paranasal mucosal disease or bone erosion. An operative endoscopy with elevation of the mucoperichondrial flaps revealed an absence of the quadrangular cartilage caudal struts and irregular, friable tissue along the cartilage and perichondrium. Surgical pathology examination demonstrated prominent lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate (Figure, A), angiocentric fibrosis with a relative lack of eosinophils (Figure, B), and increased IgG4 absolute count (up to 50 cells per high-power field), although an IgG4-IgG ratio that was only slightly elevated (0.2) (Figure, C and D).

The most likely diagnosis is IgG4-related disease. IgG4-related disease is a chronic, multisystem disorder characterized by the infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells and other inflammatory cells into tissues and organs. It can affect any organ system, but the most common sites of involvement are the salivary glands, pancreas, liver, kidneys, lungs, and orbit. The diagnosis of IgG4-related disease is based on a combination of clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings. The presence of elevated serum IgG4 levels and IgG4-positive plasma cells in tissue biopsies is supportive of the diagnosis.

The treatment of IgG4-related disease is not well-established, but corticosteroids are often used as first-line therapy. Other treatment options include immunosuppressants, such as azathioprine or rituximab.

She noted a 5-kg weight loss in the preceding 3 months. Examination revealed nonreproducible chest tenderness, bibasilar crackles, and no extra heart sounds. A 12-lead electrocardiogram is shown in Figure 1A. Testing revealed leukocytosis (white blood cell count, 16 900 cells/μL [to convert to × 109 cells/L, multiply by 0.001]) with a differential of 6% neutrophils and 59% eosinophils, an elevated N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide of 3963 pg/mL (reference level, <900 pg/mL [to convert to ng/L, multiply by 1.0]), and an elevated initial troponin T of 0.36 ng/mL, which later peaked at 0.41 ng/mL (to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1.0). Her C-reactive protein level was 3.09 mg/dL (normal, <0.5 mg/dL [to convert to milligrams per liter, multiply by 10]). Subsequent plasma flow cytometry demonstrated 65% eosinophils, and a bone marrow biopsy with immunohistochemistry showed eosinophilia without evidence of clonal expansion. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging was performed (Figure 1B; Video).

The patient's presentation is concerning for Dressler syndrome, also known as post-myocardial infarction pericarditis. Dressler syndrome is a rare, self-limited inflammatory condition that can occur after myocardial infarction. It is characterized by fever, chest pain, pericardial effusion, and pleural effusion. The diagnosis of Dressler syndrome is based on clinical presentation and supportive laboratory findings, such as an elevated white blood cell count, elevated C-reactive protein level, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Treatment of Dressler syndrome is typically with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or colchicine. In severe cases, steroids may be necessary.

In this case, the patient's presentation is consistent with Dressler syndrome. She has a history of recent myocardial infarction, and she presents with fever, chest pain, pericardial effusion, and pleural effusion. Her laboratory findings are also consistent with Dressler syndrome, with an elevated white blood cell count, elevated C-reactive protein level, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate.

The initial management of Dressler syndrome is with NSAIDs or colchicine. In severe cases, steroids may be necessary. The patient should be monitored for signs of complications, such as cardiac tamponade or constrictive pericarditis.

Erythema gyratum repens (EGR) is a rare, scaly, annular eruption that typically occurs in middle-aged or elderly adults. It is often associated with an underlying malignancy, most commonly lung cancer. The diagnosis of EGR is made clinically, based on the characteristic appearance of the eruption. Histopathology may show a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate, but this is not specific for EGR. Treatment is aimed at the underlying malignancy.

In this case, the patient is a man in his 60s who presents with a widespread, intermittently pruritic eruption. Examination shows coalescing annular, arcuate, and serpiginous red scaling plaques in a concentric pattern diffusely involving the chest, back, and abdomen with extension to proximal extremities. Punch biopsies from the chest and back were obtained for histopathology and tissue culture. Treatment with topical corticosteroids under wet dressings was associated with partial improvement in the eruption and pruritus.

The clinical presentation of this patient is consistent with EGR. The histopathology findings are also consistent with EGR, showing a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate. However, the diagnosis of EGR cannot be made definitively without ruling out other possible causes of a concentric annular eruption. In this case, the patient was found to have a lung adenocarcinoma. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is EGR associated with lung adenocarcinoma.

He has a history of high myopia and a family history of glaucoma in a female family member. He denied other prior ocular history, trauma, or eye surgery. A review of systems had no remarkable findings, and the patient denied a prodromal viral illness.

On presentation, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20-2 OD and 20/25 OS, with a refraction of −6.25 OD and −5.50 OS (spherical equivalent). The intraocular pressure was 18 OU. Gonioscopy showed openness to the ciliary body with 1+ trabecular meshwork pigmentation, without synechiae or angle recession in either eye. A slitlamp examination demonstrated quiet conjunctiva, clear corneas, deep and quiet anterior chambers, mid-dilated round pupils, patchy iris atrophy, and transillumination defects bilaterally. Ophthalmoscopy showed an 0.8 cup-disc ratio without notching bilaterally but had otherwise normal results. Retinal nerve fiber layer optical coherence tomography showed borderline thinning with normal Humphrey visual fields in both eyes.

The most likely diagnosis is Fuchs' heterochromic iridocyclitis (FHIC). FHIC is a bilateral, non-inflammatory, progressive, degenerative disorder of the iris and ciliary body. It is characterized by iris atrophy, transillumination defects, and heterochromia (difference in color between the two eyes). The cause of FHIC is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder.

The first-line treatment for FHIC is topical corticosteroids. Other treatment options include topical immunosuppressive agents, such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus, and atrophic iris surgery.

The next step in the management of this patient is to perform an anterior segment fluorescein angiography (AS-FA). AS-FA is a diagnostic test that uses fluorescein dye to visualize the blood vessels in the anterior segment of the eye. AS-FA can help to confirm the diagnosis of FHIC and to assess the extent of the disease.

Fine-needle aspiration results showed metastatic p16-positive squamous cell carcinoma. No mucosal primary site was identified with positron emission tomography, computed tomography, or a head and neck examination. The patient underwent direct laryngoscopy with directed biopsies and bilateral tonsillectomy. Pathology results revealed a 1.8-cm primary cancer in the right tonsil, and the patient received a stage designation of T1 N1 M0. The tumor was intracapsular, and all surgical margins were negative. Multidisciplinary tumor board discussion concluded that surgical and nonsurgical treatment options were available, and the patient elected to proceed with further surgery, which would entail additional directed biopsies at the primary site with additional resection if necessary and selective neck dissection of levels Ib to IV. In preparation for the neck dissection, computed tomography of the neck with contrast was obtained. Imaging results revealed an enhancing structure at the skull base adjacent to the carotid sheath.

The most likely diagnosis is a persistent trigeminal artery. A persistent trigeminal artery is a rare congenital anomaly in which the trigeminal artery persists instead of regressing during development. The trigeminal artery arises from the internal carotid artery and supplies blood to the face and scalp. It is most often associated with other congenital anomalies, such as agenesis of the internal carotid artery.

The diagnosis of a persistent trigeminal artery is made on imaging studies, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. The imaging studies will show an enhancing structure at the skull base adjacent to the carotid sheath.

The treatment of a persistent trigeminal artery is not always necessary. If the artery is asymptomatic, it can be left alone. However, if the artery is symptomatic, such as causing headaches or facial pain, it can be treated with surgery.

ADEM is a demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system that typically follows a viral infection. The most common presenting symptoms are headache, fever, and multifocal neurological deficits. The diagnosis of ADEM is made based on the clinical presentation and the results of neuroimaging studies, which typically show multifocal white matter lesions. There is no specific treatment for ADEM, but supportive care and treatment of any underlying infections are often necessary. In some cases, corticosteroids may be used to reduce inflammation.

Answer: The correct answer is B. Perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the brain. MRI and MRA are the most sensitive imaging studies for the detection of white matter lesions in ADEM. These studies can help to confirm the diagnosis of ADEM and to exclude other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, such as multiple sclerosis or a brain tumor.

The other options are incorrect because:

* Option A, Observe the patient, is incorrect because the patient's symptoms are concerning for a serious underlying medical condition. It is important to perform further diagnostic testing to determine the cause of the patient's symptoms.
* Option C, Perform a vitreous tap for viral polymerase chain reaction, is incorrect because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a viral infection of the eye. A vitreous tap is not necessary in this case.
* Option D, Administer an intravitreal injection of foscarnet, is incorrect because foscarnet is a medication used to treat viral infections of the eye. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with a viral infection of the eye, so there is no indication for treatment with foscarnet.

Reasoning:

The patient in the case has a history of hypothyroidism, which can lead to vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A is essential for the maintenance of normal epithelial cells, including the cells of the conjunctiva. Deficiency of vitamin A can lead to keratinization of the conjunctiva, as seen in this patient. Additionally, the patient has neovascular fronds at the superior corneoscleral limbus, which can be a sign of vitamin A deficiency.

Therefore, the first step in management should be to test for vitamin A deficiency. If the patient is found to be deficient, then treatment with vitamin A supplementation should be initiated. Additionally, conjunctival biopsies should be performed to rule out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms, such as an immune disorder.

Observing the patient after stopping brimonidine-timolol drops without further intervention or evaluation (option C) is not appropriate. The patient's symptoms have been progressive for 6 months, and there is no evidence that the patient's symptoms are related to the use of brimonidine-timolol drops.

Performing extensive excision of the lesion with ocular surface reconstruction, followed by disposal of the biopsy specimen (option D) is also not appropriate. The patient's symptoms are not severe enough to warrant such a radical procedure. Additionally, there is no evidence that the patient's symptoms are due to a malignancy.

Notably, she had 4 months of extreme fatigue, 20.4 kg weight loss, and a recent episode of hematochezia. Her medical history included diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension that were well controlled with simvastatin, chlorthalidone, hydralazine hydrochloride, lisinopril, and verapamil hydrochloride. She had been taking these medications for 5 years with no new exposures. Age-appropriate cancer screening was up to date. She was afebrile and hemodynamically stable, but laboratory evaluation revealed that she had leukocytosis, normocytic anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hematuria, and proteinuria. On hospital day 2, she developed bright red blood per rectum, necessitating transfusion. A computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis revealed parenchymal lung nodules. On admission, punch biopsies of the skin were performed for both histological examination and bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacterial cultures.

The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with Sweet syndrome, a rare, febrile, neutrophilic dermatosis that is characterized by painful, tender, erythematous plaques and nodules that often ulcerate. Sweet syndrome is typically associated with underlying hematologic, rheumatologic, or neoplastic disorders. The most common associated hematologic disorders are acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. The most common associated rheumatologic disorders are rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. The most common associated neoplastic disorders are acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoma.

The patient's laboratory findings are also consistent with Sweet syndrome. Leukocytosis, normocytic anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and hematuria are all common findings in patients with Sweet syndrome. Proteinuria is less common, but it can be seen in patients with Sweet syndrome who have underlying renal disease.

The patient's imaging findings are also consistent with Sweet syndrome. Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis can reveal parenchymal lung nodules in patients with Sweet syndrome. These nodules are typically small, well-defined, and non-calcified.

The patient's biopsy findings are also consistent with Sweet syndrome. Histological examination of skin biopsy specimens from patients with Sweet syndrome typically reveals a dense infiltrate of neutrophils in the papillary dermis and upper reticular dermis. The neutrophils can be admixed with eosinophils, lymphocytes, and histiocytes. Focal vasculitis can also be seen in skin biopsy specimens from patients with Sweet syndrome.

In summary, the patient's clinical presentation, laboratory findings, imaging findings, and biopsy findings are all consistent with Sweet syndrome. Sweet syndrome is a rare, febrile, neutrophilic dermatosis that is characterized by painful, tender, erythematous plaques and nodules that often ulcerate. Sweet syndrome is typically associated with underlying hematologic, rheumatologic, or neoplastic disorders. The most common associated hematologic disorders are acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes. The most common associated rheumatologic disorders are rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. The most common associated neoplastic disorders are acute lymphoblastic leukemia and lymphoma.

The physical examination reveals swelling of the second, third, and fifth MCP joints and second and third PIP joints bilaterally, as well as decreased knee and hip range of motion with minimal knee effusions. The laboratory testing is within normal limits, and the HLA-B27 test is negative. The plain radiograph of the hands shows hook-like osteophytes at the second and third MCP joints bilaterally as well as asymmetric joint swelling in multiple MCP and PIP joints. The plain radiograph of the pelvis shows sclerosis and joint narrowing at both sacroiliac joints as well as joint narrowing and osteophytes in the hip joints bilaterally. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of osteoarthritis.

The next step in the management of this patient is to order a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the sacroiliac joint. This will help to confirm the diagnosis of osteoarthritis and to assess the severity of the disease. If the MRI shows that the osteoarthritis is severe, the patient may be referred for surgical consultation. However, most patients with osteoarthritis can be managed conservatively with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), physical therapy, and weight loss.

The patient is a 31-year-old woman with decreased exercise tolerance due to shortness of breath for the past 2 weeks. She has no chest pain but was experiencing heart palpitations a few times per week. She denies any significant medical history, takes only multivitamins, and mentions a childhood heart murmur that was never evaluated.On examination, her blood pressure was 125/85 mm Hg, with a heart rate of 71/min and respiratory rate of 18/min. Physical examination revealed a fixed split S2 and a 2/6 systolic murmur at the left upper sternal border. An electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus rhythm with incomplete right bundle-branch block. A chest radiograph was obtained (Figure 1). Transthoracic echocardiography demonstrated an enlarged right atrium and right ventricle; results of contrast echocardiography were negative.

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension is a condition in which the pressure in the pulmonary arteries is elevated. This can be caused by a number of conditions, including congenital heart defects, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and connective tissue diseases. The symptoms of pulmonary hypertension can vary, but they often include shortness of breath, fatigue, and chest pain.

The initial treatment for pulmonary hypertension is usually with medications that help to lower the pressure in the pulmonary arteries. These medications can be effective in improving symptoms and slowing the progression of the disease. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to treat the underlying cause of pulmonary hypertension.

In this case, the patient's history and physical examination are consistent with pulmonary hypertension. The electrocardiogram and chest radiograph are also non-specific findings that can be seen in patients with pulmonary hypertension. The transthoracic echocardiography demonstrates an enlarged right atrium and right ventricle, which are characteristic findings of pulmonary hypertension. The results of contrast echocardiography were negative, which helps to rule out other causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a left-to-right shunt.

The next step in the management of this patient is to order a cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Cardiac MRI is a more sensitive test than transthoracic echocardiography for detecting pulmonary hypertension. It can also provide information about the underlying cause of the patient's pulmonary hypertension, such as a congenital heart defect or COPD.

Once the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension is confirmed, the patient should be started on treatment with medications that lower the pressure in the pulmonary arteries. These medications can be effective in improving symptoms and slowing the progression of the disease. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to treat the underlying cause of pulmonary hypertension.

The patient is a man in his 60s with a history of hyperlipidemia, familial polyposis, and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) who has undergone an allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant 13 months earlier. He presents with asymptomatic green-gray nodules on the chest that have been stable since onset 4 months prior. Cutaneous examination reveals green-gray nodules and plaques on the left and right upper chest. Bilateral cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymph node chains are negative for adenopathy. The patient has not attempted measures to alleviate the nodules and denies experiencing exacerbating factors or pain. Biopsies of the skin lesions were performed.

The most likely diagnosis is chloroma, a rare cutaneous manifestation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Chloroma is characterized by green-gray nodules or plaques on the skin, often in the head, neck, or upper chest. It is caused by the accumulation of myeloid blast cells in the skin. The diagnosis is made by biopsy of the skin lesion.

Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare, aggressive skin cancer that can occur in any part of the body. It is most common in older adults, and is more common in men than women. Merkel cell carcinoma is often associated with sun exposure. The initial presentation of Merkel cell carcinoma is usually a small, painless nodule on the skin. The nodule may grow rapidly and become ulcerated. Merkel cell carcinoma can metastasize to the lymph nodes, lungs, liver, and brain. The diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma is made by biopsy of the skin lesion.

Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) is a rare, aggressive type of leukemia. It is characterized by the accumulation of blast cells in the blood and bone marrow. BPDCN can also involve the skin, lymph nodes, and other organs. The diagnosis of BPDCN is made by biopsy of the bone marrow.

Histiocytoid Sweet syndrome is a rare, inflammatory skin condition that is associated with fever, leukocytosis, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. It is most common in women, and is often associated with infections, medications, or autoimmune diseases. The initial presentation of histiocytoid Sweet syndrome is usually a painful rash of red or purple papules or plaques. The rash is often associated with fever, chills, and malaise. The diagnosis of histiocytoid Sweet syndrome is made based on the clinical presentation and skin biopsy.

In this case, the most likely diagnosis is chloroma, given the patient's history of AML and the presence of green-gray nodules on the chest. The other diagnoses are less likely given the patient's history and presentation.

The most likely diagnosis is Churg-Strauss syndrome (CSS). CSS is a rare, multisystem vasculitis characterized by eosinophilia, asthma, and granulomatous inflammation of the small and medium-sized blood vessels. The clinical presentation of CSS is highly variable, but it typically includes asthma, peripheral neuropathy, pulmonary infiltrates, and mononeuritis multiplex. Other possible manifestations include skin lesions, cardiac involvement, and gastrointestinal symptoms.

The diagnosis of CSS is based on clinical findings and laboratory tests. The characteristic laboratory finding is an elevated eosinophil count. Other laboratory abnormalities that may be seen in CSS include elevated serum IgE levels, positive antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) tests, and low complement levels.

The treatment of CSS is with corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents. The prognosis for patients with CSS is generally good, with most patients achieving remission with treatment. However, some patients may have persistent or recurrent disease, and CSS can be fatal in rare cases.

Reasoning:

The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with acute allergic keratoconjunctivitis. The most common cause of this condition is exposure to an allergen, such as the milky latex of the plant she handled. The patient's symptoms began 1 day after she was exposed to the allergen, which is consistent with the typical time course for allergic reactions. Her ocular findings include conjunctival hyperemia, chemosis, and a watery discharge. She also has corneal edema, which is a common finding in allergic keratoconjunctivitis.

The initial treatment for allergic keratoconjunctivitis is topical corticosteroid eyedrops. These medications help to reduce inflammation and swelling. The patient should also avoid further exposure to the allergen. If the symptoms are severe or do not improve with topical corticosteroids, oral antihistamines may be added.

Intrastromal injection of anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a treatment option for corneal edema caused by other conditions, such as diabetic retinopathy. However, it is not indicated for allergic keratoconjunctivitis.

Beginning oral and/or topical antiviral medications is appropriate for patients with herpetic keratitis, which is a viral infection of the cornea. However, the patient's history and examination findings are not consistent with herpetic keratitis.

The patient has already received broad-spectrum antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals, but the infection has not responded to treatment. The patient's white blood cell count is uptrending, raising concern for systemic spread of the infection. A transscleral subretinal biopsy would allow for direct visualization of the retina and collection of tissue for culture and other diagnostic tests. However, this procedure is invasive and carries a risk of complications, such as retinal detachment. Repeated diagnostic vitrectomy with repeated subretinal biopsy would also allow for direct visualization of the retina and collection of tissue for culture and other diagnostic tests. However, this procedure is also invasive and carries a risk of complications, such as retinal detachment. Increasing systemic immunosuppressive therapy would be unlikely to be effective in treating this infection. In fact, increasing systemic immunosuppressive therapy could increase the risk of systemic spread of the infection. Therefore, the best option is to continue intravitreal injections of antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral medications. These medications will help to treat the infection and prevent it from spreading to the rest of the body.

The most common presentation is a single, non-tender, ulcerated nodule on an exposed area of skin, such as the hands or feet. The lesion may be present for several months or even years before healing spontaneously.

In this case, the patient is a young girl who lives in a rural area on the Mediterranean coast. This is a region where cutaneous leishmaniasis is endemic.

The patient is an 81-year-old woman with systemic hypertension and atrial fibrillation who underwent Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) for visual acuity of counting fingers because of postphacoemulsification bullous keratopathy with no prior episodes of inflammatory eye disease. Her best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) improved to 20/40 two weeks later, limited because of a preexisting corneal scar. Five weeks later, there was a painless decrease in BCVA to 20/80. Small keratic precipitates (KPs) were noted. Because the patient admitted to inconsistent adherence to the topical steroid regimen, rejection was suspected. Prednisolone acetate, 1%, was increased from 4 times to 8 times daily. Five days later the KP resolved and a slow taper of the prednisolone was initiated. Six weeks later, while taking prednisolone 6 times daily, the patient developed new KPs in coin-shaped aggregates (Figure 1B) along with new anterior chamber (AC) inflammation. Her intraocular pressure (IOP) increased to 25 mm Hg. No vitritis or infiltrates were in the graft-host interface or capsular bag. Donor rim culture results were negative for mycobacteria, fungus, and bacteria, including Propionibacterium acnes.

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is cytomegalovirus (CMV) endotheliitis. CMV endotheliitis is a common cause of graft failure after DMEK. It is typically seen in patients with underlying systemic CMV infection, such as those who are immunocompromised. The diagnosis of CMV endotheliitis is based on the clinical presentation, including the presence of coin-shaped KPs, anterior chamber inflammation, and elevated IOP. Laboratory testing, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of aqueous humor for CMV DNA, can be helpful in confirming the diagnosis. Treatment of CMV endotheliitis typically involves the use of antiviral agents, such as ganciclovir or foscarnet. In some cases, it may also be necessary to use topical steroids or to perform a vitreous tap with intravitreal antibiotic injection.

In the case of this patient, the most appropriate next step is to obtain a PCR of aqueous humor for CMV DNA. This will help to confirm the diagnosis of CMV endotheliitis and to guide treatment. If the PCR is positive, the patient should be started on antiviral therapy. If the PCR is negative, other possible causes of graft failure should be considered, such as bacterial or fungal infection.

She denies nasal disturbance, prior sinus surgery, asthma, or acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin) sensitivity. Symptoms were refractory to treatment with several rounds of oral antibiotics and oral steroids. Physical examination findings revealed symmetric facial movement with prominent glabellar swelling and soft tissue thickening. Nasal endoscopy findings revealed a soft tissue mass anterior to the axilla of the middle turbinates bilaterally, with normal-appearing mucosa overlying. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were obtained for further evaluation, which showed a hyperintense soft tissue mass on anterior septum with extension into frontal sinus. Adjacent soft tissue thickening noted on skin overlying frontal sinus and nasal bones. No intracranial extension noted. Pathology results revealed uniform, epithelioid cells arranged in a whorled, lobulated growth pattern without atypia, necrosis, increased cellularity, or diffuse growth pattern.

Esthesioneuroblastoma typically presents in adults between the ages of 20 and 50 years. The most common presenting symptoms are nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and facial pain. Esthesioneuroblastoma can spread to the orbit, skull base, and brain. The treatment of esthesioneuroblastoma is surgical resection with or without adjuvant radiation therapy.

The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of hypertension who presents with exertional left calf discomfort. She has no history of spinal degenerative disease and does not have lower extremity arterial bruits, wounds, sensory deficits, edema, or hair loss. Results of an exercise treadmill ankle-brachial index (ABI) test show a resting ABI of 1.0 and an exercise ABI of 0.8. These findings are consistent with peripheral artery disease (PAD).

PAD is a condition in which the arteries that carry blood to the legs become narrowed or blocked. This can cause pain, cramping, and numbness in the legs, especially when walking or climbing stairs. PAD is a common condition, especially in older adults and people with risk factors such as smoking, diabetes, and high blood pressure.

The treatment for PAD depends on the severity of the disease. In mild cases, lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking, losing weight, and exercising regularly may be enough to control the symptoms. In more severe cases, medication or surgery may be necessary to open up the blocked arteries.

In this case, the patient's symptoms are consistent with PAD. The exercise ABI of 0.8 is below the normal range of 1.0 to 1.4, which suggests that there is a significant narrowing of the arteries in her legs. The patient also has risk factors for PAD, such as hypertension and age.

The next step in the management of this patient is to order a lower extremity arterial duplex ultrasound. This is a non-invasive test that can be used to assess the patency of the arteries in the legs. The results of this test will help to determine the severity of the patient's PAD and the best course of treatment.

The abdominal pain and distention, as well as the pelvic ascites and enhancing lesion at the base of the cecum, are concerning for metastatic disease. The ultrasound-guided paracentesis was nondiagnostic, so a more invasive procedure is likely necessary to obtain a diagnosis. Laparoscopic appendectomy and peritoneal biopsy would allow for the removal of the appendix and a biopsy of the peritoneal fluid. This would provide the most definitive diagnosis.

Answer: A

The other options are not as likely to provide a definitive diagnosis. Repeat image-guided paracentesis/cytology is less likely to be successful than a laparoscopic appendectomy and peritoneal biopsy, as the previous paracentesis was nondiagnostic. Colonoscopy with biopsy is not likely to be helpful, as the patient's symptoms are not concerning for colon cancer.

The patient is an older adult with a history of a mildly pruritic plaque on the elbow at the site of a prior injury. The medical history is unremarkable, and findings of a review of systems are negative. The patient has been treated in the past with topical steroids without improvement, and the size of the lesion has continued to grow slowly. Physical examination findings reveal a solitary, well-circumscribed pink plaque with overlying yellow-white micaceous scale with interspersed punctate hemorrhagic crusts. Lymphadenopathy is not identified. Punch biopsy for histopathologic examination was performed, with representative sections shown.

The most likely diagnosis is Koebnerized psoriasis vulgaris. Koebnerization is the development of psoriasis in a traumatized area of skin. This is a well-recognized phenomenon in psoriasis, and it is the most likely explanation for the patient's lesion. The history of a prior injury at the site of the lesion, the lack of other systemic symptoms, and the characteristic histopathologic findings all support the diagnosis of Koebnerized psoriasis vulgaris.

Sporotrichosis is a fungal infection that can cause skin lesions, but it is more likely to occur in the extremities, particularly the hands and feet. The lesions of sporotrichosis are usually solitary, and they are often described as verrucous or ulcerative. The histopathologic findings of sporotrichosis can be variable, but they typically show a granulomatous infiltrate with scattered yeast forms.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a systemic vasculitis that can cause skin lesions. However, the skin lesions of granulomatosis with polyangiitis are usually multiple and they are often located on the face, hands, and feet. The histopathologic findings of granulomatosis with polyangiitis show a necrotizing granulomatous vasculitis.

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder that can cause skin lesions. However, the skin lesions of sarcoidosis are usually multiple and they are often located on the face, upper trunk, and extremities.

Reasoning:

The patient is in shock secondary to a myocardial infarction. He has already received maximal medical therapy, including intravenous fluids, escalating doses of intravenous dopamine hydrochloride and epinephrine drips, and PCI. Despite these interventions, his blood pressure continues to rapidly decline, and he has experienced an asystolic cardiac arrest.

VA ECMO is a life-saving therapy that can be used to support patients in cardiogenic shock. It provides both cardiac and respiratory support by bypassing the heart and lungs. VA ECMO is a temporary measure that is used until the patient's heart can recover or until a heart transplant can be performed.

In this patient's case, VA ECMO is the best option to provide him with the support he needs to survive. It will allow his heart to rest and recover, and it will provide him with adequate oxygen and blood flow. Without VA ECMO, the patient is likely to die.

The other options are not appropriate in this patient's case. A percutaneous left ventricular assist device (LVAD) is a mechanical device that can be used to support the heart, but it is not appropriate for patients in cardiogenic shock. Pericardiocentesis is a procedure that is used to remove fluid from the pericardial sac, but it is not appropriate for patients in cardiogenic shock. Root and ascending aortography is a procedure that is used to visualize the aorta, but it is not appropriate for patients in cardiogenic shock.

The patient is a 45-year-old male professional voice user with a history of asthma being treated with inhaled steroids. He presented with a 1-year history of dysphonia. He reported throat tightness after significant voice use and consistent voice roughness that worsened over several weeks. On examination, he had moderate to severe dysphonia with predominant roughness and strain. Videostroboscopy findings were consistent with fungal laryngitis; a 2-week course of fluconazole was administered. Follow-up videostroboscopy findings demonstrated resolution of the fungal laryngitis but revealed residual fullness of the left false vocal fold and appearance of prolapsed ventricular mucosa obstructing the lateral extent of the left true vocal fold. There was a reduction of lateral excursion of the mucosal wave on the left. The patient continued to report dysphonia and increased vocal effort. A computed tomography scan with contrast showed no specific abnormalities. A direct laryngoscopy for evaluation and treatment was planned. Intraoperatively, there was a firm lesion in the left paraglottic space extending to the lateral aspect of the true vocal fold. A subtle but similar finding was seen on the right true vocal fold, not causing any mass effect. An incision was made in the mucosa of the ventricle overlying the lesion at its lateral extent, and a mucosal flap was elevated over the lesion. This revealed a cartilaginous lesion, which was removed using an AcuBlade CO2 laser (Lumenis) and cup forceps until the cartilaginous edge was smooth within the paraglottic space. The histologic specimen showed fragments of cartilage with no nuclear atypia or mitosis. At 3-months’ follow-up, the patient reported improvement in his voice with decreased effort and strain, which correlated with improvement in the Voice Handicap Index score and objective assessment by the clinicians.

Based on the clinical presentation and the histopathology findings, the most likely diagnosis is chondroma. Chondromas are benign tumors of cartilage that typically occur in the paraglottic space of the larynx. They are most commonly seen in adults, and there is a slight male predominance. The most common presenting symptom is hoarseness, which may be accompanied by throat pain, dysphagia, and stridor. On examination, a firm, submucosal mass may be seen on the vocal fold. Imaging studies, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis and determining the extent of the lesion. Treatment is surgical excision of the tumor. The prognosis is excellent, with most patients having a good voice outcome after surgery.

The patient is a 57-year-old African American man with a brown pigmented patch on the left side of the hard palate. The lesion was of unknown duration and was reported by the patient to be asymptomatic, although he did endorse occasional pruritus. An extraoral examination was performed without any abnormal findings. On intraoral soft tissue examination, a brown pigmented patch located predominantly on the hard palate was observed. The lesion had well-defined but irregular borders, measured 2 × 1.2 cm in size, and was nontender to palpation. Findings of the remainder of the intraoral soft tissue examination were within normal limits. An incisional biopsy was performed, and the specimen was sent for microscopic diagnosis.

Histologic examination findings revealed soft tissue covered by benign-appearing stratified squamous epithelium, focally spongiotic and acanthotic. Within the epithelium, numerous benign dendritic melanocytes were identified. The underlying connective tissues were unremarkable.

Based on the history, physical examination, and histopathology findings, the most likely diagnosis is focal melanotic macule (focal melanosis). Focal melanotic macules are common, benign lesions that are typically found in middle-aged and older adults. They are more common in African Americans and Hispanics. The lesions are usually asymptomatic, but they may occasionally be pruritic. Focal melanotic macules are typically solitary, but they may be multiple. They are usually brown or black in color, and they may be flat or slightly raised. The borders of the lesions are usually well-defined, but they may be irregular. The lesions are typically less than 1 cm in diameter, but they may be larger. Focal melanotic macules are diagnosed based on the history, physical examination, and histopathology findings. The histopathology findings show increased numbers of melanocytes in the epidermis. The melanocytes are typically dendritic in shape. The lesions are benign and do not require treatment. However, they should be monitored for any changes in size, shape, or color.

The patient is a 34-year-old man with a 3-month history of progressive, unilateral lower lip and chin numbness and ipsilateral facial fullness. The hypoesthesia is limited to the distribution of the mandibular branch of the left trigeminal nerve (V3). On review of systems, the patient denied experiencing visual changes, dizziness, headaches, oral or neck pain, voice changes, weight or appetite changes, or swallowing dysfunction; however, he did report biting his lip occasionally due to the numbness. On examination, there were no palpable masses noted in the head, neck, or face. Aside from the V3 sensory deficit, the patient had no cranial nerve deficits. The patient has no significant medical history; prior surgical history was notable for tonsillectomy. Magnetic resonance imaging of the face revealed a T1 isointense, T2 hyperintense 5.9-cm lesion in the left masticator space, which appeared to be centered in the lateral pterygoid muscle with benign-appearing remodeling of the posterior maxillary wall.

The most likely diagnosis is a schwannoma. Schwannomas are benign tumors that arise from Schwann cells, which are the cells that myelinate nerve fibers. They are the most common type of nerve sheath tumor, and they can occur anywhere in the body. Schwannomas are typically slow-growing tumors, and they often present with symptoms of nerve compression, such as numbness, weakness, or pain. On imaging, schwannomas are typically well-circumscribed, lobulated masses that are isointense to hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. They may enhance with contrast.

Other possible diagnoses include juvenile angiofibroma, odontogenic keratocyst, and chondrosarcoma. Juvenile angiofibromas are benign tumors that arise from the nasopharyngeal mucosa. They are typically seen in adolescent males, and they often present with nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and facial pain. On imaging, juvenile angiofibromas are typically heterogeneous masses that are hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. They may enhance with contrast. Odontogenic keratocysts are benign tumors that arise from the odontogenic epithelium. They are typically seen in young adults, and they often present with a painless swelling in the jaw. On imaging, odontogenic keratocysts are typically well-circumscribed, unilocular masses that are hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. They may enhance with contrast. Chondrosarcomas are malignant tumors that arise from cartilage. They are typically seen in adults, and they often present with pain, swelling, and a mass in the bone. On imaging, chondrosarcomas are typically heterogeneous masses that are hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. They may enhance with contrast.

In this case, the patient's history and imaging findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of schwannoma. The patient's progressive, unilateral lower lip and chin numbness and ipsilateral facial fullness are consistent with nerve compression by a mass in the left masticator space. The mass is isointense to hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images, which is typical of a schwannoma. The mass does not enhance with contrast, which is also typical of a schwannoma.

 24%|██▎       | 360/1525 [1:24:53<4:56:28, 15.27s/it]The correct answer is: Metastatic sarcoma.

Reasoning:

* The patient is a young adult nonsmoker with a history of asthma. This is a relatively young age to develop metastatic disease, and the history of asthma is not a risk factor for any of the other options.
* The patient presented with a palpable mass on the left side of the neck that had been present for several months, reportedly unchanged. This is consistent with a slow-growing tumor.
* The patient had been treated presumptively for infection with antibiotics, with no improvement. This suggests that the mass is not infectious.
* No fever, odynophagia, dysphagia, otalgia, or other constitutional symptoms were reported. This is consistent with a slow-growing tumor that is not yet causing significant symptoms.
* Physical examination findings demonstrated a palpable, soft, nontender left level II/III neck mass. This is consistent with a mass that is not invading adjacent structures.
* Clinical examination findings of the thyroid and upper aerodigestive tract were unremarkable. This suggests that the mass is not arising from the thyroid or upper aerodigestive tract.
* Contrast-enhanced neck computed tomography (CT) showed a large avidly enhancing mass centered at the left carotid bifurcation splaying the internal and external carotid arteries and extending cranially along the cervical internal carotid artery. The left internal jugular vein was displaced posteriorly. There was also a smaller mass with similar appearance at the right carotid bifurcation. This is consistent with a large, aggressive tumor that is invading adjacent structures.
* Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT showed several enhancing masses in the liver. This is consistent with metastatic disease.
* Based on CT findings, gallium Ga 68 (68Ga) dotatate positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed; results demonstrated intense radiotracer avidity in bilateral carotid space masses, hepatic masses, and numerous CT occult osseous lesions. This is consistent with a highly aggressive tumor that is metastatic to multiple sites.

Based on the above, the most likely diagnosis is metastatic sarcoma.

He was found to be anemic and had a history of tick bite. Infectious serology test results for Lyme disease, syphilis, malaria, Anaplasma species, Cryptococcus species, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and rickettsia were negative. Rheumatologic serology test results for antinuclear antibodies, including Sjögren anti-Ro and anti-La, anti-DNA, and anti-Smith, were also negative. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody testing revealed elevated proteinase 3 antibody level. In the setting of anemia, infectious-disease consultants raised concern for babesiosis. Peripheral blood smear and polymerase chain reaction were performed; empirical therapy of azithromycin, 500 mg daily, plus atovaquone, 750 mg twice daily, was initiated. Polymerase chain reaction results for babesiosis later returned as negative.

Ocular examination revealed uncorrected distance acuity of 20/50 OD and 20/60 OS. Intraocular pressure values were normal, and there was no afferent pupillary defect. Slitlamp evaluation showed bilateral rare anterior vitreous cell. Dilated fundus examination revealed bilateral reddened foveal lesions and irregular macular pigmentation.

The next step in management is to obtain optical coherence tomography (OCT). OCT is a non-invasive imaging technique that can provide detailed images of the retina. In this case, OCT can be used to assess the extent of damage to the fovea, the central part of the retina responsible for sharp vision. This information can help to guide further management, including the possibility of laser therapy.

The patient is a 64-year-old man with bilateral optic nerve head edema. He denies having any symptoms of increased intracranial pressure (ICP), including headaches, pulsatile tinnitus, and transient visual obscurations. Findings on computed tomography of the brain without contrast were unremarkable. He was then seen by an ophthalmologist who confirmed bilateral severe optic nerve edema and requested magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits without contrast. It demonstrated signs of increased ICP, including empty sella, posterior flattening of the globes, and widened optic nerve sheaths, but no other abnormalities.

The next step in the management of this patient is to obtain venography (computed tomography or magnetic resonance) of the brain. This will help to determine the underlying cause of the increased ICP. Possible causes include a brain tumor, a subdural hematoma, or a cerebral venous thrombosis. Once the cause of the increased ICP is identified, treatment can be initiated.

Reasoning: The patient's history of heavy tobacco and alcohol consumption puts him at risk for nutritional deficiencies, including vitamin B12 and folate deficiency. Vitamin B12 and folate are essential for the proper functioning of the nervous system, and deficiency can lead to optic neuropathy, which is a condition that damages the optic nerve and can cause vision loss.

The patient's presentation is consistent with optic neuropathy, with bilateral optic nerve hyperemia, blurred margins, and subtle telangiectatic vessels on the surface of the optic nerve bilaterally. Humphrey 24-2 Swedish Interactive Testing Algorithm fast visual field testing showed central scotomas in both eyes, which further supports the diagnosis of optic neuropathy.

Treatment of optic neuropathy due to nutritional deficiency typically involves supplementation with vitamin B12 and folate. In some cases, other treatments may also be necessary, such as corticosteroids or surgery.

A. Liver function tests are not necessary in this case, as the patient's history and presentation are not consistent with liver disease.

C. Treatment with disulfiram is not indicated in this case, as the patient does not have alcohol dependence.

D. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain is not necessary in this case, as the patient's history and presentation are not consistent with a brain tumor or other intracranial lesion.

Netarsudil is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, which is a type of medication used to treat glaucoma. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors work by reducing the production of aqueous humor, which is a fluid that fills the eye. This can help to lower intraocular pressure, which is the pressure inside the eye.

However, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors can also cause corneal edema. This is because they can decrease the production of tears, which help to keep the cornea moist. Corneal edema is a condition in which the cornea becomes swollen. This can cause blurred vision, pain, and irritation.

In this case, the patient is experiencing worsening corneal edema after starting netarsudil. The best course of action is to stop netarsudil. This will help to reduce the swelling in the cornea and improve the patient's vision.

The patient is a 23-year-old woman with a 1-month history of worsening pain, dynamic color changes, and ulcerations involving the fingertips of both hands. She also reports hair loss, dryness of the eyes and mouth, and mild esophageal dysphagia. On examination, she has periungual erythema with dilated nailfold capillaries but no splinter hemorrhages. Her hands and fingers are mildly edematous, and the fingertips variably show purple discoloration, distal pitting scars, and ischemic ulcers. Laboratory studies show a white blood cell count of 3270/μL, hemoglobin level of 14.5 g/dL, platelet count of 143 ×103/μL, creatinine level of 1.0 mg/dL, and C-reactive protein level of 0.1 mg/dL. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the bilateral upper extremities shows normal vasculature. Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) are positive at 1:640 or greater by indirect immunofluorescence in a composite nuclear and nucleolar fine speckled staining pattern. Subserologic testing showed high positive anti-Ro52 (176; <20), anti-Ro60 (563; <20), and anti–Scl-70 antibodies (786; <20).

The most likely diagnosis is systemic sclerosis (SSc), a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by fibrosis of the skin and internal organs. SSc is more common in women than men, and typically presents in the third to fourth decades of life. The classic triad of SSc is Raynaud's phenomenon, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasias. Other common manifestations include esophageal dysmotility, pulmonary hypertension, and renal crisis.

The diagnosis of SSc is made based on clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. Antinuclear antibodies are present in 95% of patients with SSc, and the most specific antibodies are anti-topoisomerase I (anti-Scl-70) and anti-centromere antibodies. Chest radiography may show pulmonary fibrosis, and high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) may show more detailed findings. Cardiac evaluation is important to assess for pulmonary hypertension and aortic regurgitation.

There is no cure for SSc, but treatment is aimed at controlling the symptoms and preventing complications. Raynaud's phenomenon is treated with calcium channel blockers, vasodilators, and sympatholytics. Esophageal dysmotility is treated with prokinetic agents. Pulmonary hypertension is treated with vasodilators and anticoagulation. Renal crisis is treated with plasmapheresis and immunosuppressive drugs.

The patient in this case has many of the characteristic features of SSc, including Raynaud's phenomenon, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasias. Her laboratory tests are also consistent with SSc, with positive ANA and anti-Scl-70 antibodies. Given the patient's presentation, the most appropriate next step is to initiate treatment with intravenous pulse-dose methylprednisolone. This treatment will help to suppress the immune system and reduce inflammation. The patient should also be referred to a rheumatologist for further management.

The patient is a middle-aged African American woman who presents with a 6-month history of erythematous and scaly plaques on her lower legs associated with 30-kg weight loss. The plaques began around her ankles and spread proximally, reaching the upper thighs by the time of presentation. She also noted new lesions on her arms and abdomen in the preceding weeks. The eruption was asymptomatic, and the plaques were preceded by lower extremity edema and weakness, resulting in difficulty ambulating and frequent falls. The patient also reported allodynia, tingling, and numbness in her lower legs. She took no medications and her medical history was significant for a first-trimester miscarriage. She was a schoolteacher and had not traveled outside of the country in the past 10 years.

On physical examination, the patient had erythematous and indurated plaques, some with overlying coarse scale on her lower extremities. Her neurological examination showed symmetric 4/5 strength and decreased reflexes in her lower extremities. Sensation to light touch and proprioception were diminished below the knee. Two punch biopsies were performed for histologic review, which showed granulomatous inflammation throughout the dermis with mild hyperparakeratosis around a hair follicle.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes plaque and ichthyosiform sarcoidosis, lymphomatoid granulomatosis, interstitial granulomatous dermatitis, and cutaneous tuberculosis.

Plaque and ichthyosiform sarcoidosis is a rare variant of sarcoidosis that typically presents with erythematous, scaly plaques on the extremities. The plaques are often associated with systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy. Histologically, plaque and ichthyosiform sarcoidosis is characterized by granulomatous inflammation in the dermis.

Lymphomatoid granulomatosis is a rare, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that typically presents with fever, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy. The skin lesions of lymphomatoid granulomatosis are often papules, nodules, or tumors. Histologically, lymphomatoid granulomatosis is characterized by a mixed cellular infiltrate in the dermis, with lymphocytes, plasma cells, and histiocytes.

Interstitial granulomatous dermatitis is a rare, idiopathic skin disorder that typically presents with erythematous, papular, or nodular lesions on the extremities. The lesions of interstitial granulomatous dermatitis are often associated with systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and arthralgias. Histologically, interstitial granulomatous dermatitis is characterized by granulomatous inflammation in the dermis and subcutis.

Cutaneous tuberculosis is a rare form of tuberculosis that typically presents with papules, nodules, or ulcers on the skin. The skin lesions of cutaneous tuberculosis are often associated with systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy. Histologically, cutaneous tuberculosis is characterized by granulomatous inflammation in the dermis.

In this patient, the most likely diagnosis is plaque and ichthyosiform sarcoidosis. The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with sarcoidosis, and the biopsy findings are characteristic of plaque and ichthyosiform sarcoidosis.

The plaque is erythematous, violaceous, indurated, and scaly, with some papules. The results of routine blood tests and biochemistry analysis were within normal limits. A biopsy sample was obtained for histopathologic examination, which revealed perifollicular lymphocytic infiltrates around cystically dilated follicular infundibula and exocytosis of atypical lymphocytes into the epithelium, with admixed plasma cells, eosinophils, and multinucleate giant cells. Alcian blue staining showed focal mild follicular mucin deposition. Immunohistochemical analysis showed lymphocytic infiltrates positive for CD3, CD4, CD5, and CD7 and negative for CD8, CD20, CD30, CD79a, and CD56. The ratio of CD4 to CD8 cells within hair follicles was greater than 7:1. Monoclonal T-cell gene rearrangement was demonstrated.

The most likely diagnosis is unilesional folliculotropic mycosis fungoides (MF). MF is a rare, chronic, T-cell lymphoma that typically presents with patches or plaques on the skin. The lesions are often scaly and pruritic, and they may be indurated or violaceous. MF can also involve the lymph nodes, skin appendages, and viscera.

The histopathologic findings of MF are characteristic, and they include perifollicular lymphocytic infiltrates, exocytosis of atypical lymphocytes into the epithelium, and follicular mucinosis. Immunohistochemical staining is helpful in confirming the diagnosis, as MF lesions typically show a predominance of CD4-positive T cells. Monoclonal T-cell gene rearrangement is also a helpful diagnostic finding.

The treatment of MF depends on the stage of the disease. Early-stage MF is often treated with topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors. More advanced disease may be treated with phototherapy, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy.

She presented with a 3-month history of gradual vision loss and 1-month history of confusion and difficulty with word finding. She had been diagnosed with hormone receptor–positive right breast cancer 8 years prior and underwent lumpectomy and treatment with an aromatase inhibitor, with remission since. Five years later, she subsequently developed left inguinal adenopathy, which biopsy results showed was follicular lymphoma. At that time, she was treated with a course of bendamustine and rituximab with subsequent maintenance treatment with rituximab for 2 years. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was performed, demonstrating T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensity in the left occipital and temporal lobes, crossing the corpus callosum and extending into the right occipital lobe without enhancement.

The most likely diagnosis is central nervous system lymphoma (CNS lymphoma). This is a type of lymphoma that affects the brain and spinal cord. It is most common in people with a history of cancer, such as the patient in this case. The symptoms of CNS lymphoma can vary depending on the location of the tumor, but they often include headache, seizures, confusion, and difficulty with vision, speech, or movement.

He presents with 3 weeks of progressively worsening dysphonia, dyspnea, and biphasic stridor. On arrival to the hospital, he has a computed tomography scan performed, which demonstrates an obstructive laryngeal mass but no signs of local invasion or lymphadenopathy. He is taken urgently to the operating room where an awake tracheostomy is performed without complication. Findings of a direct laryngoscopy demonstrate violaceous nodules of the base of the tongue as well as a mass of the infraglottis and subglottis, which was nearly completely obstructing the airway. Full physical examination findings also demonstrate violaceous nodules involving the patient’s lower extremities. Results of an excisional biopsy demonstrate a subepithelial spindle cell lesion with extravasation of erythrocytes and stained strongly for human herpesvirus-8.

Kaposi sarcoma is a vascular neoplasm that is seen in patients with advanced HIV infection. It is characterized by the development of violaceous nodules or plaques on the skin, mucous membranes, and viscera. The diagnosis is made by biopsy, which shows the characteristic spindle cell proliferation with extravasation of erythrocytes.

Syphilitic gumma is a granulomatous lesion that is seen in patients with untreated syphilis. It is characterized by the development of a firm, painless nodule that can ulcerate. The diagnosis is made by biopsy, which shows the characteristic spirochetes.

The patient is a 44-year-old woman with a 6-year history of a slow-growing, painless parotid mass. The mass is solid and hypoechoic on ultrasound, with minimal vascularity and no extraparotid extension. Fine-needle aspiration shows sheets and clusters of bland polygonal epithelial cells admixed with bright pink filamentous matrix. The final pathology shows histologic findings compatible with salivary gland carcinoma, with microcystic and papillary architecture. Abundant bubbly secretion is present within these microcystic spaces, and this material is positive for periodic acid–Schiff. Immunohistochemically, there is positivity for epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratin (CK) 7 and CK19, S100 protein, and gross cystic disease fluid protein 15 (GCDFP-15). Stains for gastrointestinal stromal tumors 1 (DOG1) and p63 are negative. The tumor appears to be contained within the surgical excision margins. There was perineural invasion without evidence of neoplastic emboli in the peritumoral lymphovascular spaces. The patient underwent a right parotidectomy I to IV1 and a level II superselective neck dissection.

The differential diagnosis for a salivary gland carcinoma with microcystic and papillary architecture includes acinic cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, not otherwise specified, secretory carcinoma, and low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Acinic cell carcinoma is the most common type of salivary gland carcinoma, accounting for about 25% of cases. It is typically a low-grade tumor with a good prognosis. Adenocarcinoma, not otherwise specified, is a heterogeneous group of tumors that account for about 50% of salivary gland carcinomas. The prognosis varies depending on the tumor grade. Secretory carcinoma is a rare type of salivary gland carcinoma that is typically seen in young women. It is a low-grade tumor with a good prognosis. Low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma is the second most common type of salivary gland carcinoma, accounting for about 20% of cases. It is typically a low-grade tumor with a good prognosis.

In this case, the patient has a 6-year history of a slow-growing, painless parotid mass. The mass is solid and hypoechoic on ultrasound, with minimal vascularity and no extraparotid extension. Fine-needle aspiration shows sheets and clusters of bland polygonal epithelial cells admixed with bright pink filamentous matrix. The final pathology shows histologic findings compatible with salivary gland carcinoma, with microcystic and papillary architecture. Abundant bubbly secretion is present within these microcystic spaces, and this material is positive for periodic acid–Schiff. Immunohistochemically, there is positivity for epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratin (CK) 7 and CK19, S100 protein, and gross cystic disease fluid protein 15 (GCDFP-15). Stains for gastrointestinal stromal tumors 1 (DOG1) and p63 are negative. The tumor appears to be contained within the surgical excision margins. There was perineural invasion without evidence of neoplastic emboli in the peritumoral lymphovascular spaces. The patient underwent a right parotidectomy I to IV1 and a level II superselective neck dissection.

The clinical and pathologic features of this case are most consistent with a diagnosis of secretory carcinoma.

Intraocular pressures were normal in each eye. Anterior segment and fundus examination results were normal in the right eye. In the left eye, the media were clear, and there were multiple patchy, yellow choroidal lesions with obliteration of the normal choroidal vasculature throughout the entire fundus. There was no sign of vitritis or retinitis and no history of previous trauma, uveitis, sarcoidosis, or cancer. Ocular ultrasonography revealed diffuse ciliochoroidal thickening measuring 2.9 mm in elevation. Optical coherence tomography disclosed generalized, undulating choroidal infiltration in a seasick pattern, so to speak, given its resemblance to a stormy ocean surface, with overlying draping of the retina in the foveal region. A relook at the anterior segment in the left eye revealed a faint conjunctival thickening at the limbus suggestive of lymphoid tumor. Incisional biopsy of the epibulbar lesion revealed sheetlike infiltration of small monomorphic lymphocytes with irregular nuclear contours and Dutcher bodies.

The most likely diagnosis is primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). PCNSL is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that affects the brain and spinal cord. It is the most common type of primary brain tumor in adults. PCNSL is usually diagnosed in people who are over the age of 60, and it is more common in men than in women. The cause of PCNSL is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

The most common symptoms of PCNSL are headache, seizures, and vision problems. Other symptoms may include weakness, numbness, confusion, and personality changes. PCNSL is often diagnosed after a person has a brain biopsy. Treatment for PCNSL usually involves a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The goal of treatment is to cure the cancer or to control it for as long as possible.

In the case of the patient in the question, the most likely next step is to complete serum immunoglobulin level tests, DNA molecular analysis, and bone marrow biopsy. These tests will help to confirm the diagnosis of PCNSL and to determine the extent of the disease. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, the patient will be started on treatment. The treatment plan will be based on the patient's age, overall health, and the stage of the disease.

Reasoning:

The patient has a 9-day history of a progressively enlarging right lower eyelid lesion that was not painful but was associated with ipsilateral facial numbness. On examination, he manifested a 9 × 6-mm ulcerated marginal lesion of the central right lower eyelid with surrounding edema and erythema. There was no associated lash loss and the region was nontender to palpation. There was notable hypoesthesia in the distribution of the trigeminal maxillary branch. On examination, his best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU. The pupils were round and brisk without an afferent pupillary defect. He manifested full extraocular movements. The anterior segment examination, applanation tonometry, and dilated fundus examination results were within normal limits.

The differential diagnosis for this patient's presentation includes herpes zoster ophthalmicus, bacterial cellulitis, and sebaceous carcinoma. Herpes zoster ophthalmicus is the most likely diagnosis given the patient's history of a painful vesicular eruption in the distribution of the ophthalmic branch of the trigeminal nerve, followed by a progressive ulcerated lesion of the right lower eyelid. Bacterial cellulitis is a less likely diagnosis given the patient's lack of pain and tenderness, and the absence of systemic signs of infection. Sebaceous carcinoma is a rare malignancy that can present as an ulcerated lesion of the eyelid.

The next step in the management of this patient is to perform an excisional biopsy of the lesion. This will allow for definitive diagnosis and treatment. If the lesion is confirmed to be herpes zoster ophthalmicus, the patient will be treated with antiviral therapy. If the lesion is confirmed to be bacterial cellulitis, the patient will be treated with antibiotics. If the lesion is confirmed to be sebaceous carcinoma, the patient will be treated with surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.

A. Continued antibiotic therapy is not the best next step in this patient's management because the patient does not have evidence of bacterial infection.

B. Wound debridement is not the best next step in this patient's management because the lesion is not infected and there is no evidence of necrosis.

D. Computed tomography scan of the orbits is not the best next step in this patient's management because the patient does not have evidence of orbital involvement.

The patient presents with a rapidly progressive retinal vaso-occlusive disease. The most likely cause of this is a demyelinating disorder, such as multiple sclerosis. Systemic corticosteroids are the first-line treatment for multiple sclerosis, and they are also effective in treating retinal vaso-occlusive disease associated with multiple sclerosis. Intraocular corticosteroid injections may also be helpful, but they are not as effective as systemic corticosteroids. High-dose oral valacyclovir is a treatment for herpes zoster, which is a viral infection that can cause retinal vaso-occlusive disease. However, the patient does not have any symptoms of herpes zoster, and her fundus examination does not show any evidence of herpes zoster infection. Benzathine penicillin G is a treatment for bacterial infections, such as syphilis. However, the patient does not have any symptoms of syphilis, and her fundus examination does not show any evidence of syphilis infection.

The patient is a young man with a slowly progressive history of peripheral vision loss. He has no history of trauma, tobacco, alcohol, or drug use. His family history is unremarkable. His physical examination is unremarkable except for mild optic nerve pallor and vascular attenuation in both eyes. The dilated fundus examination shows subtle areas of increased pigmentation in the superior retina of the right eye only. The fundus autofluorescence results show bilateral peripheral mottled hypoautofluorescence contrasting a ring of hyperautofluorescence around the macula. Automated perimetry shows symmetrical severe bilateral field constriction with a remaining island of 6° of central vision.

The differential diagnosis for this patient's presentation includes optic neuritis, multiple sclerosis, retinal vasculitis, and Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy.

Optic neuritis is an inflammation of the optic nerve that can cause sudden vision loss. It is often associated with multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including vision loss, numbness, tingling, weakness, and fatigue. Retinal vasculitis is an inflammation of the blood vessels in the retina. It can be caused by a variety of conditions, including systemic lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis, and Behçet's disease. Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy is a genetic disorder that affects the optic nerve. It causes sudden, painless vision loss in one or both eyes.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to obtain a full-field electroretinogram (ERG). The ERG is a test that measures the electrical activity of the retina. It can be used to diagnose optic neuritis, multiple sclerosis, retinal vasculitis, and Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy.

This is consistent with the diagnosis of iris cysts. Iris cysts are usually benign, but they can cause vision problems if they grow large enough. In this case, the patient has already reported progressive visual obscuration in his left eye. Therefore, it is important to rule out any underlying medical conditions that could be causing the cysts or contributing to their growth. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is a good choice for this purpose. A CT scan can detect a variety of medical conditions, including tumors, infections, and inflammation. It can also be used to assess the size and location of the cysts. If the CT scan is normal, then the patient can be treated with laser surgery to remove the cysts. However, if the CT scan shows any abnormalities, then further testing may be necessary.

 25%|██▍       | 377/1525 [1:28:50<4:10:28, 13.09s/it]The correct answer is D: Perform right upper lobe resection.

The patient has a large cavitary mass in the right upper lobe of her lung. This mass has enlarged and is now invading the pleura. She has developed hypoxemia and required intubation. A right-sided tension pneumothorax developed and required emergency chest tube placement. The pleural fluid is charcoal-black in color, suggesting the presence of necrotic tissue.

The patient's clinical presentation and imaging findings are consistent with a diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. This is a serious fungal infection that can be life-threatening. The treatment for invasive aspergillosis is surgical resection of the infected lung tissue. This is the only way to ensure that the infection is completely eradicated.

Antimicrobial therapy is also important in the treatment of invasive aspergillosis. However, antimicrobials alone are not sufficient to cure the infection. Surgical resection is necessary to remove the infected tissue.

The patient in this case has already received empiric antimicrobial therapy with vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam. However, her clinical condition has continued to deteriorate. She now requires intubation and has developed a tension pneumothorax. These findings suggest that the infection is not responding to antimicrobial therapy.

The next step in the management of this patient is to perform right upper lobe resection. This will remove the infected lung tissue and allow the patient to receive definitive treatment with antimicrobials.

The patient is a white woman in her early 40s who has been experiencing generalized pruritus for 10 years. She has no other medical history. She has been treated with topical corticosteroids with no control of the symptoms. Physical examination reveals erythematous papules, some of them crusted, and some excoriations located over the trunk and upper extremities. In addition, some scales and fissures are seen on her lower lip. A new biopsy sample was taken to rule out actinic cheilitis.

The most likely diagnosis is actinic prurigo cheilitis. Actinic prurigo is a chronic, pruritic skin condition that is associated with sun exposure. It is characterized by the development of erythematous papules, some of which may crust or become excoriated. The lesions are typically located on the sun-exposed areas of the skin, such as the face, neck, and extremities. Actinic prurigo is more common in women and is often associated with a history of atopic dermatitis.

The diagnosis of actinic prurigo is based on the clinical presentation and a history of sun exposure. A skin biopsy may be performed to rule out other conditions, such as actinic keratosis or squamous cell carcinoma. There is no cure for actinic prurigo, but the symptoms can be managed with topical corticosteroids, antihistamines, and phototherapy.

Reasoning:

* The patient has a history of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, which is a known metastatic tumor.
* The patient has multiple hypodense lesions in the apex of her heart, which are suggestive of metastases.
* The patient's transthoracic echocardiogram revealed several discrete, partially mobile frondlike masses originating from her cardiac apex, which are also suggestive of metastases.
* Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the presence of multiple, hypointense masses in the apex of the left ventricle, which are consistent with metastases.

Myxoma, angiosarcoma, and apical left ventricular thrombus are all rare cardiac tumors. Myxomas are the most common type of primary cardiac tumor, but they are typically benign. Angiosarcomas are malignant tumors that can arise from the heart or other organs. Apical left ventricular thrombi are blood clots that form in the apex of the left ventricle. They are most commonly associated with atrial fibrillation, but they can also occur in patients with other cardiac conditions, such as myocardial infarction or infective endocarditis.

In the patient's case, the history of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, the presence of multiple hypodense lesions in the apex of the heart, the findings on transthoracic echocardiography, and the confirmation of multiple, hypointense masses in the apex of the left ventricle by cardiac magnetic resonance imaging are all consistent with the diagnosis of cardiac metastases from pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

The patient is a 32-year-old man with a diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy who is presenting with angina and dyspnea with exertion. His cardiomyopathy followed a diagnosis of myocarditis after repeated putative chest colds and chest pain at age 14 years. His ejection fraction is 40%. An exercise nuclear stress test revealed a fixed, severe apical defect, a partially reversible severe anterior wall defect, moderate global hypokinesis, and severe hypokinesis of the distal anterior wall and apex. His ejection fraction is estimated to be 32%. Given these findings, left-sided heart catheterization was performed.

The most likely cause of the patient's cardiomyopathy is myocarditis. Myocarditis is an inflammation of the heart muscle that can be caused by a variety of factors, including viral infections, bacterial infections, autoimmune diseases, and toxins. Myocarditis can lead to a decrease in the function of the heart muscle, which can cause symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue.

The treatment of cardiomyopathy depends on the severity of the disease and the underlying cause. In some cases, treatment may not be necessary. In other cases, treatment may include medications, such as diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and beta-blockers, to improve the function of the heart muscle. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to repair or replace the heart valve.

In the case of the patient described above, the most appropriate treatment is likely to be percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). PCI is a procedure that is used to open narrowed or blocked arteries. In this case, the left anterior descending artery is narrowed, which is likely the cause of the patient's angina and dyspnea. PCI can be used to open the narrowed artery and improve blood flow to the heart muscle.

Coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) is another procedure that can be used to treat cardiomyopathy. CABG involves taking a blood vessel from another part of the body and using it to bypass a narrowed or blocked artery. CABG is usually only recommended for patients who have severe cardiomyopathy and who are not candidates for PCI.

Coronary artery reimplantation is a surgical procedure that is used to repair a narrowed or blocked coronary artery. In this procedure, the narrowed or blocked artery is opened and then sutured back together. Coronary artery reimplantation is usually only recommended for patients who have severe cardiomyopathy and who are not candidates for PCI or CABG.

Continue medical management is not the most appropriate treatment for the patient described above. The patient's cardiomyopathy is severe and he is experiencing symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and fatigue. Continued medical management is unlikely to improve his symptoms or slow the progression of his disease.

The patient is an 80-year-old man with a history of coronary artery disease, hypothyroidism, and prostate cancer in remission who presents with 3 months of painless progressive vision loss, followed by gait changes, memory loss, and 10-lb unintentional weight loss. On ophthalmic examination, visual acuity is hand motion OU, with briskly reactive left pupil and trace right relative afferent pupillary defect. He can detect 2/4 gross colors in the right eye and 1/4 gross colors in the left eye. Confrontation visual fields reveal dense right homonymous hemianopia with additional asymmetric deficits on Goldmann perimetry. Extraocular movements are full with gaze-evoked nystagmus. Horizontal vestibulo-ocular reflex, assessed by head impulse testing, is normal. Slitlamp and dilated fundus examination reveal pseudophakia and mild epiretinal membrane in the right eye and mild nuclear sclerosis in the left eye. Magnetic resonance imaging brain and orbits with and without contrast and magnetic resonance angiography head and neck were unremarkable. An electroencephalogram showed no localizing signs. Syphilis screen was negative. Serum thiamine, vitamin B12, and thyrotropin levels were normal. Cerebrospinal fluid composition, infectious studies, cytology, flow cytometry, and paraneoplastic panel showed only mildly elevated protein.

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is Lewy body dementia. Lewy body dementia is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of Lewy bodies, which are abnormal protein deposits, in the brain. The symptoms of Lewy body dementia can vary from person to person, but they typically include cognitive decline, visual hallucinations, and changes in behavior. There is no cure for Lewy body dementia, but there are treatments that can help to manage the symptoms.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to order a cerebrospinal fluid prion disease panel. This test will help to rule out Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is a rare but fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by prions. Prions are misfolded proteins that can damage healthy brain cells. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is characterized by rapidly progressive dementia, visual hallucinations, and ataxia. There is no cure for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and the disease is usually fatal within a year of diagnosis.

The patient is a 37-year-old woman with slowly progressive unilateral blepharoptosis that had been worsening for several years. The patient is otherwise asymptomatic, and a complete review of systems was negative. The results of her physical examination were notable for left-sided blepharoptosis with a palpable mass of the upper eyelid laterally. Eyelid eversion examination findings showed a yellow nodular lesion along the tarsal conjunctiva. An incisional biopsy was performed. Histopathologic examination results showed amorphous acellular proteinaceous deposits that positively stained with Congo red. Polarized microscopy of the deposits showed apple-green birefringence.

The most likely diagnosis is amyloidosis. Amyloidosis is a group of diseases characterized by the deposition of amyloid, a protein that forms abnormal aggregates. Amyloidosis can affect multiple organs and systems, including the skin, eyes, heart, kidneys, and nerves.

The treatment of amyloidosis depends on the type of amyloidosis and the organs involved. In general, treatment is aimed at reducing the production of amyloid and removing amyloid deposits. This may be done with medications, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove amyloid deposits.

In the case of the patient described above, the next step would be to order a systemic laboratory workup to determine the type of amyloidosis and the extent of disease involvement. This would include blood tests, such as a complete blood count, liver function tests, and kidney function tests. Imaging studies, such as a chest X-ray, an abdominal ultrasound, and a CT scan of the head and neck, may also be ordered.

Once the type of amyloidosis and the extent of disease involvement have been determined, a treatment plan can be developed. The treatment plan may include medications, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove amyloid deposits.

The physical examination reveals a 1-cm nummular plaque with centralized micaceous scale and a smooth erythematous border on the right lateral lower leg. A tangential-shave biopsy was performed to characterize the lesion.

Histopathological testing revealed an epidermis featuring elongated rete ridges, keratinocyte enlargement, and a few Civatte bodies, with overlying parakeratotic crust and neutrophilic cell debris. Marked epidermotropism of atypical lymphocytes with irregular nuclear contours and halos, both singly and in small collections (Pautrier microabscesses) were also observed. Also, lymphocytes were present along the epidermal side of the dermoepidermal junction. Periodic acid–Schiff stained sections failed to show fungal or yeast elements. Immunohistochemical staining was markedly positive for CD3, CD5, and CD8; CD4 reactivity was less robust and mainly restricted to dermal lymphocytes. Also, CD20 was present in 5% of dermal lymphocytes, and CD30 showed variable staining of 5% of lymphocytes.

A slight atrophy of the hyperpigmented skin was palpable without any signs of induration. The first onset was in her childhood, at the age of 6 years, with a small hyperpigmentation on the right side of her lower chest remaining stable for years. In her early 20s the area of hyperpigmentation started to spread slowly over the above-mentioned areas and became more and more intense. Intravenous penicillin G therapy with 10 million units 3 times daily over 1 week combined with a UV-A1 phototherapy in 18 sessions with a maximum dose of 40 J/cm2 and a cumulative overall dose of 670 J/cm2 showed no effects. A punch biopsy was obtained.

The differential diagnosis includes epidermal nevus, linear atrophoderma of Moulin, lichen striatus, and segmental incontinentia pigmenti. Epidermal nevus is a congenital malformation of the epidermis that presents as a localized area of hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation. Linear atrophoderma of Moulin is a rare, congenital disorder characterized by atrophic, linear streaks of skin. Lichen striatus is a self-limiting inflammatory dermatosis of unknown etiology that presents as linear streaks of erythema, scaling, and atrophy. Segmental incontinentia pigmenti is a rare, X-linked dominant disorder characterized by linear streaks of hypopigmentation, hyperpigmentation, and verrucous lesions.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is segmental incontinentia pigmenti. This is supported by the following findings:

* The patient is a woman in her late 20s, which is the typical age of onset for segmental incontinentia pigmenti.
* The lesions are unilateral and follow the lines of Blaschko, which is a characteristic feature of segmental incontinentia pigmenti.
* The lesions are atrophic, which is a common finding in segmental incontinentia pigmenti.
* The lesions have been present since childhood and have gradually worsened, which is the typical course of segmental incontinentia pigmenti.
* Intravenous penicillin G therapy and UV-A1 phototherapy have been ineffective, which is consistent with the poor response to treatment seen in segmental incontinentia pigmenti.

The diagnosis of segmental incontinentia pigmenti can be confirmed by histopathologic examination, which typically shows atrophic epidermis with hyperpigmentation of the basal layer and a lack of elastic fibers in the dermis.

The patient is an elderly man with a history of congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, atrial fibrillation, transient ischemic attack, and Parkinson disease. He has a pacemaker and is dependent in all activities of daily living. He presents with a 4-month history of new-onset persistent facial eruption. He denies a history of facial flushing. The patient was initially treated for rosacea at an outside hospital with topical 1% metronidazole cream for 1 month without improvement and developed acute facial purpura after 1 day of treatment with oral doxycycline, which was discontinued. Because of the eruption's rapid onset and violaceous appearance, as well as empirical treatment failure, the patient was referred for further evaluation. On examination, the patient had asymmetric, centrofacial, erythematous-violaceous indurated telangiectatic and ecchymotic plaques over a phymatous background. A series of punch biopsies were performed.

The histopathologic image shows ectatic vessels with plump endothelia involving the deep dermis and hypodermis. On higher magnification, ectatic vascular channels were lined by atypical plump endothelial cells. Immunohistochemistry was negative for Human herpesvirus 8.

The differential diagnosis includes Kaposi sarcoma, elder abuse, rosacea-like angiosarcoma, and telangiectatic metastatic carcinoma.

Kaposi sarcoma is a vascular neoplasm that is typically seen in patients with AIDS. It is caused by Human herpesvirus 8. The patient in this case does not have AIDS and his biopsy was negative for Human herpesvirus 8, so Kaposi sarcoma is unlikely.

Elder abuse is a form of abuse that occurs in older adults. It can take many forms, including physical abuse, emotional abuse, financial abuse, and neglect. The patient in this case does not have any signs of physical abuse, emotional abuse, financial abuse, or neglect, so elder abuse is unlikely.

Rosacea-like angiosarcoma is a rare type of skin cancer that can resemble rosacea. It is typically seen in middle-aged and older adults. The patient in this case is an elderly man, and his biopsy shows ectatic vessels with plump endothelia involving the deep dermis and hypodermis, which are findings that are consistent with rosacea-like angiosarcoma. Therefore, rosacea-like angiosarcoma is the most likely diagnosis.

Telangiectatic metastatic carcinoma is a type of metastatic cancer that can cause telangiectasias. It is typically seen in patients with breast cancer, lung cancer, and prostate cancer. The patient in this case does not have a history of any of these cancers, and his biopsy was negative for Human herpesvirus 8, so telangiectatic metastatic carcinoma is unlikely.

The patient is a 39-year-old woman with a 3-week history of worsening spasms in her axial and lower limb muscles and new-onset urinary retention. The spasms first appeared in her abdominal muscles 2 weeks after a cold. Soon after, they spread to all of her axial muscles and both lower limbs. These paroxysmal episodes lasted a few seconds, occurred up to 20 times a day, and were exacerbated by external stimuli. There was no impairment of consciousness during the attacks. A review of her previous records revealed a diagnosis of Hashimoto thyroiditis 1 month earlier. She had no history of tobacco, alcohol, or drug use.

On admission, the patient was hyperhidrotic and tachypneic. Neurological examination revealed an abnormal mental status, slow saccades, symmetric and severe hypertonia and rigidity throughout her trunk and all 4 extremities, severe spasms, patella clonus associated with brisk deep tendon reflexes, marked myoclonus on tactile and acoustic stimulation, and bilateral extensor plantar responses.

Laboratory results were significant for an elevated level of thyroperoxidase antibodies (50.85 IU/mL; normal, <5.16 IU/mL) and thyroglobulin antibodies (88.35 ng/mL; normal: <4.11 ng/mL; to convert to micrograms per liter, multiply by 1). Cerebrospinal fluid testing results revealed normal protein level and cell counts, as well as absent oligoclonal bands or evidence of infection. Her paraneoplastic panel results were negative. Cranial and spinal magnetic resonance imaging yielded no abnormalities. Needle electromyography (EMG) results showed a continuous firing of normal motor unit potentials at rest within the axial and lower limb muscles. A routine electroencephalogram (EEG) showed mild background slowing without periodic discharges. Computed tomography scan results of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis were negative. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia.

The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of progressive encephalomyelitis with rigidity and myoclonus (PERM). PERM is a rare, autoimmune disorder characterized by progressive rigidity, myoclonus, and seizures. It is typically associated with antibodies to the glycine receptor. The diagnosis of PERM is made based on clinical findings, laboratory testing, and imaging studies. There is no cure for PERM, but treatment with immunosuppressive medications can help to control the symptoms.

The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a 7-month history of multiple painful erythematous plaques on her lower legs. The lesions appeared as erythematous nodules on the left leg with tenderness and pruritus and rapidly progressed to both legs. Marked lower-leg edema was noted 20 days prior to the visit. She also had an intermittent fever during the past 3 months that did not respond to antibiotic therapy. The patient’s medical history was unremarkable.

Physical examination revealed ill-defined, indurated erythematous-violaceous plaques on the lower extremities with substantial edema. Complete blood cell count revealed a normal white blood cell count with moderate anemia (hemoglobin level, 87 g/L; normal range 115-150 g/L). Additional laboratory tests demonstrated an elevated level of serum lactate dehydrogenase (749 U/L; normal range 100-240 U/L) (to convert to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167). Quantification of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA in sera showed a high viral load of EBV in peripheral blood (1 800 000 copies/mL, normal range <500 copies/mL). A skin biopsy specimen was obtained from a violaceous plaque.

The most likely diagnosis is intravascular large B-cell lymphoma (ILBCL). ILBCL is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that typically affects older adults. It is characterized by the infiltration of large B-cell lymphocytes into the blood vessels. The clinical presentation of ILBCL is variable, but it often includes fever, weight loss, and fatigue. The diagnosis is made based on a biopsy of the involved tissue, which shows the characteristic infiltration of large B-cell lymphocytes into the blood vessels.

The treatment of ILBCL depends on the stage of the disease. In early-stage disease, treatment may consist of chemotherapy or radiation therapy. In more advanced disease, treatment may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and stem cell transplantation.

The prognosis for patients with ILBCL varies depending on the stage of the disease. Patients with early-stage disease have a good prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate of over 80%. Patients with more advanced disease have a poorer prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate of around 50%.

The patient is a 38-year-old woman who presented with worsening dyspnea and lower extremity edema at 1 week post partum. Her history is significant for a planned vaginal delivery that was complicated by breached position of the fetus, fetal distress, and new onset of fever. The delivery was converted to a cesarean birth, which was uncomplicated. Perioperatively, she had an episode of chest pain that resolved spontaneously. Her physical examination findings showed a new heart murmur. A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) was performed, which showed a normal-sized left ventricle and preserved left ventricular ejection fraction, severe aortic regurgitation (AR), and a mildly dilated aortic root.

The differential diagnosis for this patient's presentation includes aortic dissection, infective endocarditis, and acute aortic regurgitation. Aortic dissection is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate diagnosis and treatment. Infective endocarditis is a bacterial infection of the heart valves that can also be life-threatening. Acute aortic regurgitation is a condition in which the aortic valve does not close properly, allowing blood to flow back into the left ventricle.

The next step in the management of this patient is to perform a transesophageal echocardiography (TEE). TEE is a more sensitive and specific test than TTE for the diagnosis of aortic dissection, infective endocarditis, and acute aortic regurgitation. If the TEE is negative for these conditions, the patient can be managed conservatively with diuretics and afterload reduction. If the TEE is positive for one of these conditions, the patient will require further management, such as surgery or antibiotics.

The patient has severe progressive bilateral vision loss with headaches. She has bilateral disc edema, a non-contrast head CT and CT angiogram that are remarkable only for bilateral optic nerve head abnormalities, a magnetic resonance imaging that is concerning for prominent optic nerves, and a lumbar puncture that reveals a cerebrospinal fluid opening pressure of 40 cm of water. Her cerebrospinal fluid protein, glucose, IgG, and oligoclonal band levels are within normal limits, and her renal function is normal. She was started receiving oral acetazolamide, 500 mg, twice daily for presumed idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) and transferred to the hospital. On admission, she was noted to have near-complete vision loss in both eyes, severe postural headaches, and nausea with vomiting. Her visual acuity was hand motion OD and no light perception OS. Her fundoscopic examination revealed severe papilledema (Frisen grade 4-5 OD; grade 5 OS). A magnetic resonance venography was performed and revealed bilateral filling defect of the transverse sinuses, suggestive of bilateral nonocclusive dural venous sinus thromboses (DVST). The patient continued receiving acetazolamide, 500 mg, twice daily, which was dose escalated to 2000 mg twice daily over 24 hours.

The next step in management is to consult neurosurgery for consideration of drain or shunt placement. DVST is a rare but serious condition that can cause vision loss, seizures, and other neurological problems. The treatment for DVST is typically anticoagulation, but this may not be effective in all cases.

The patient is an older woman with a history of chronic kidney disease and genital herpes simplex virus (HSV). She presents with an 8-month history of a growing, painful tumor on her right buttock. The tumor is verrucous, exophytic, and has scant yellow drainage. Superficial bacterial cultures obtained from the lesion grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. An incisional biopsy was performed, which showed a hyperplastic epidermis with ulceration, necrosis, and a very dense inflammatory infiltrate. The epithelium showed focal multinucleated keratinocytes, some with gray-blue cytoplasm.

Based on the clinical presentation and histopathologic findings, the most likely diagnosis is giant condyloma acuminatum (Buschke-Löwenstein tumor). This is a rare, benign genital tumor that is caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). It is typically seen in young and middle-aged adults, and is more common in men than women. The tumor is usually multifocal and presents as a large, cauliflower-like mass. It can be locally destructive, but it does not metastasize.

The differential diagnosis for giant condyloma acuminatum includes squamous cell carcinoma, CD30-positive primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma, and herpes vegetans. Squamous cell carcinoma is a malignant tumor that can arise in any part of the skin, including the perianal region. It is more common in older adults, and is associated with chronic sun exposure. CD30-positive primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a rare, aggressive lymphoma that typically affects young adults. It can present as a single or multiple skin lesions. Herpes vegetans is a rare, chronic, recurrent infection of the skin and mucous membranes that is caused by HSV. It is characterized by verrucous, exophytic lesions.

The treatment for giant condyloma acuminatum is surgical excision. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy may be used in cases that are not amenable to surgery. The prognosis for patients with giant condyloma acuminatum is good, with most patients achieving long-term remission after treatment.

The initial biopsy showed an epidermotropic infiltrate of hyperchromatic, convoluted, atypical CD3+, CD4−, and CD8+ lymphocytes with haloed nuclei with basilar tagging and papillary dermal fibrosis. Studies of T-cell gene rearrangements identified a clonal population. Blood-flow cytometry did not reveal aberrant T-cell immunophenotypes. The patient was treated initially with topical and intralesional corticosteroids and narrow band UV B phototherapy. Oral bexarotene was subsequently added for recalcitrant disease. Within 2 months, she developed isolated, painful tumors. A second biopsy showed an epidermotropic infiltrate of CD3+, CD4−, and CD8− weak lymphocytes, which were positive for TIA-1, granzymes, and B factor (Bf) 1 and negative for CD30 and CD56. The results of flow cytometry and imaging were unremarkable. After an initial favorable response with chlorambucil, she developed expanding ulcerated tumors complicated by a polymicrobial superinfection. Chlorambucil was discontinued in favor of antimicrobial treatment. She then received liposomal doxorubicin, although skin involvement continued to progress rapidly, with ulcerating tumors making up as much as 80% of her total body surface area. She was hospitalized for worsening disease and pain.

The most likely diagnosis is primary cutaneous aggressive epidermotropic cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell lymphoma (PCAECTCL). This is a rare, aggressive form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that typically presents in middle-aged adults with a rapidly evolving rash. The rash is often described as scaly erythematous patches and plaques, which may progress to isolated, painful tumors. The initial biopsy shows an epidermotropic infiltrate of atypical CD3+, CD4−, and CD8+ lymphocytes with haloed nuclei with basilar tagging and papillary dermal fibrosis. Studies of T-cell gene rearrangements identify a clonal population. Blood-flow cytometry does not reveal aberrant T-cell immunophenotypes. Treatment with topical and intralesional corticosteroids and narrow band UV B phototherapy is often unsuccessful. Systemic therapy with chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be necessary.

The patient is a 55-year-old woman with a 6-week history of an enlarging, tender, pruritic, 4-cm erythematous patch with central inflammatory papules distributed on the medial forehead. She was initially treated for presumed shingles with valacyclovir, cephalexin, gabapentin, and hydrocortisone 2.5% topical ointment with no improvement in appearance or symptoms. No other cutaneous abnormalities were noted. A punch biopsy specimen of the left medial forehead was obtained, and histological and immunohistochemical analyses were performed.

The histopathological results revealed dissecting vascular channels (black arrowheads) and spindle cells (white arrowheads) (hematoxylin-eosin). Immunohistochemical staining revealed CD31 and diffuse expression of FLI-1 and ERG in the vascular and spindle cell components.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of angiosarcoma. Angiosarcoma is a rare, aggressive vascular neoplasm that can occur in any part of the body, but is most commonly found in the skin. It is typically diagnosed in adults over the age of 50, and is more common in women than men. The exact cause of angiosarcoma is unknown, but it is thought to be associated with exposure to certain environmental toxins, such as vinyl chloride and arsenic.

The most common symptom of angiosarcoma is a rapidly growing, painless lump on the skin. The lump may be red, purple, or blue, and may be associated with bleeding or ulceration. Angiosarcoma can also spread to other parts of the body, including the lymph nodes, lungs, liver, and bones.

The treatment for angiosarcoma depends on the stage of the disease at the time of diagnosis. In early-stage disease, surgery may be curative. In more advanced disease, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or targeted therapy may be used.

The prognosis for angiosarcoma varies depending on the stage of the disease at the time of diagnosis. In general, the outlook for patients with angiosarcoma is poor. The 5-year survival rate for patients with localized disease is approximately 60%, while the 5-year survival rate for patients with metastatic disease is less than 10%.

The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with fungal orbital cellulitis, which is a serious infection that can lead to blindness if not treated promptly. The patient's history of diabetes mellitus and renal transplant makes him at increased risk for fungal infections. The imaging studies show evidence of inflammation and infection in the right orbit. The sinus biopsy results confirm the diagnosis of fungal orbital cellulitis.

The treatment of fungal orbital cellulitis includes systemic antifungal therapy and surgical debridement of the infected tissue. The goal of surgery is to remove all of the infected tissue and to provide drainage of any abscesses. In this case, the patient's renal status is not stable enough to tolerate contrast-enhanced imaging. Therefore, the next step in management is to perform orbital debridement.

Transcutaneous retrobulbar injection of an antifungal agent is not a definitive treatment for fungal orbital cellulitis. It may be used as an adjunct to systemic antifungal therapy, but it is not sufficient to treat the infection on its own.

Orbital exenteration is a radical surgical procedure that involves removal of the eye, the orbital contents, and the surrounding tissues. It is reserved for cases of fungal orbital cellulitis that are unresponsive to other treatments.

In conclusion, the next step in management of this patient is to perform orbital debridement.

 26%|██▋       | 402/1525 [1:34:22<4:29:17, 14.39s/it]The correct answer is: B. Amelanotic melanoma.

Reasoning:

The patient is an elderly male with a family history of cutaneous melanoma. He presents with an asymptomatic, slightly eroded, translucent nodule on his right nipple. The lesion is translucent with arborizing vessels and erosion on dermoscopic examination. A punch biopsy was performed.

The differential diagnosis for a translucent nodule of the nipple includes basal cell carcinoma, amelanotic melanoma, ductal adenocarcinoma of the breast, and erosive adenomatosis of the nipple.

Basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer. It is typically a slow-growing, well-circumscribed lesion that is often found on sun-exposed areas of the skin. Basal cell carcinoma is rarely fatal, but it can be locally destructive if not treated.

Amelanotic melanoma is a rare type of melanoma that does not produce melanin. It can be difficult to diagnose clinically and often presents as a pigmented lesion. Amelanotic melanoma is more aggressive than melanoma with melanin and has a worse prognosis.

Ductal adenocarcinoma of the breast is a type of breast cancer that starts in the ducts of the breast. It is the most common type of breast cancer. Ductal adenocarcinoma of the breast can be locally destructive and can spread to other parts of the body.

Erosive adenomatosis of the nipple is a rare condition that can cause a translucent nodule of the nipple. It is characterized by inflammation and erosion of the nipple and areola. Erosive adenomatosis of the nipple is not cancerous.

The patient's history of cutaneous melanoma in his family and the presence of a translucent nodule of the nipple with arborizing vessels and erosion on dermoscopic examination are consistent with a diagnosis of amelanotic melanoma.

The patient should be referred to a dermatologist for further evaluation and treatment.

She presents with dyspnea on exertion and weight gain of 5 kg over the past month. Her physical examination reveals bibasilar coarse crackles and pretibial edema. A chest radiographic image shows bibasilar infiltrates. An electrocardiogram is notable for atrial fibrillation, and echocardiography reveals normal left ventricular function, mild right atrial and ventricular dilatation, and severe tricuspid regurgitation. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography image reveals bilateral ground-glass opacities and right basilar consolidations, with no evidence of thromboembolisms. Para-aortic and inguinal lymphadenopathies are also noted. Presumptive diagnoses of pulmonary hypertension (PH) and right-sided heart failure were made. The patient began receiving dobutamine and furosemide, but she continuously required 2 to 10 L of oxygen, and further invasive evaluations could not be performed. An echocardiogram identified aggravating PH (transtricuspid pressure gradient, 57 mm Hg). A thorough physical examination identified scaly, crusty genital skin lesions pathologically compatible with extramammary Paget disease. The patient deteriorated and died despite treatment. An autopsy was performed.

The most likely diagnosis is pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy (P-TTMA). P-TTMA is a rare, life-threatening complication of metastatic cancer that occurs when tumor cells embolize into the pulmonary vasculature. The embolized tumor cells release pro-coagulant factors, which trigger the formation of thrombi and microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Patients with P-TTMA typically present with dyspnea, fatigue, and weight loss. Physical examination may reveal signs of right heart failure, such as jugular venous distention and peripheral edema. Laboratory findings may include anemia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels. Chest imaging may show pulmonary infiltrates or consolidation. Electrocardiogram may show atrial fibrillation or other arrhythmias. Echocardiography may reveal right ventricular dysfunction and pulmonary hypertension.

The diagnosis of P-TTMA is made by biopsy of the lung or other affected organ. Treatment is supportive and includes oxygen therapy, diuretics, and anticoagulation. In some cases, chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be beneficial. The prognosis for patients with P-TTMA is poor, with a median survival of only 3-6 months.

The most likely cause of the pericardial effusion is the IVC stent, which is compressing the inferior vena cava and preventing venous return to the heart. The patient needs urgent treatment to relieve the pressure on the heart and prevent cardiac arrest.

Answer: C

The patient should be urgently referred to a vascular surgeon for removal of the IVC stent. This is the only way to relieve the pressure on the heart and prevent cardiac arrest. Pericardiocentesis with pericardial drain placement may be used as a temporary measure to relieve the pressure on the heart, but it is not a definitive treatment.

The patient is a 29-year-old man with a history of reactive airway disease and eczema who presents with progressive odynophagia, hoarseness, and dysphagia of solids, liquids, and secretions for the past 6 months. There were no respiratory symptoms, and results of a complete head and neck physical examination were unremarkable. Flexible nasolaryngoscopy was performed and revealed erythema and swelling to the right arytenoid. A 2-week course of doxycycline was completed for presumed infectious supraglottitis without a change in symptoms. A biopsy and culture of the lesion was then collected in the office and revealed inflammatory disease but ultimately was nondiagnostic. The patient chose observation vs further workup at that time. The patient returned 6 months later with worsening symptoms. Repeat flexible nasolaryngoscopy was performed and revealed significant edema of the right arytenoid extending into the aryepiglottic fold, limiting the mobility of the right vocal fold. Microdirect laryngoscopy and biopsy under general anesthesia was performed, and a specimen was sent to the pathology department for permanent section analysis and flow cytometry. Permanent sections showed unremarkable squamous mucosa. Flow cytometry revealed mixed inflammatory infiltrate and an increased plasma cell component. Results of stains for infectious organisms were negative. Further immunohistochemical analysis confirmed the diagnosis. A full-body nuclear magnetic resonance positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan was performed to rule out systemic disease.

The most likely diagnosis is IgG4-related disease. IgG4-related disease is a systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by the infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells into tissues, leading to inflammation and fibrosis. It can affect any organ system, but the most common sites of involvement are the pancreas, salivary glands, liver, kidney, and lungs. The diagnosis of IgG4-related disease is based on a combination of clinical features, laboratory findings, and imaging studies. Treatment typically involves corticosteroids.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely. Laryngeal tuberculosis is a rare condition that is usually seen in patients with a history of tuberculosis. Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect many different organ systems, including the skin, joints, kidneys, and heart. Churg-Strauss syndrome is a rare vasculitis that is characterized by the inflammation of small and medium-sized blood vessels.

The patient is a 31-year-old female with a 3-year history of right nasal pain and radiating facial pain. She reports feeling a mass in her right nostril that has not changed in size, as well as associated nasal tenderness to the external nose, worsening pain with exposure to cold temperatures, and frequent sneezing. She has been prescribed fluticasone and loratadine for allergic rhinitis without resolution of symptoms. She denies difficulty breathing, epistaxis, rhinorrhea, fever, chills, weight loss, or night sweats. She is a nonsmoker and nondrinker.

On physical examination, her external nose has no visible lesions. A rhinoscopy reveals normal mucosa with a submucosal, round, firm, tender lesion, measuring approximately 1 cm and located on the right anterior nasal septum. No drainage is visualized. Her turbinates appear normal.

The patient underwent surgical excision of the septal lesion under general anesthesia for definitive diagnosis. The specimen measured 1.1 × 0.7 × 0.2 cm and was erythematous, soft, vascular, and adherent, with a broad base to the anterior superior nasal septal mucosa just inferior to the upper lateral cartilage. The lesion was excised down through the perichondrium.

The most likely diagnosis is a glomus tumor. Glomus tumors are benign, slow-growing tumors that arise from the glomus bodies, which are small, specialized neurovascular structures that are found in the head and neck. They are most commonly found in the middle ear, but they can also occur in the nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, and orbit.

Glomus tumors are typically characterized by their bright red color, which is due to their high vascularity. They are also often tender to palpation. The most common symptom of a glomus tumor is pain, which can be severe and can radiate to the face, head, and neck. Other symptoms may include nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and hearing loss.

Glomus tumors are diagnosed with a biopsy. The treatment of glomus tumors is surgical excision. The prognosis for glomus tumors is excellent, with most patients experiencing complete relief of symptoms after surgery.

He was diagnosed with asthma 2 years earlier when he first started experiencing shortness of breath and had partial relief with inhaled albuterol treatments only. He had no history of fevers, dysphagia, odynophagia, cough, or allergies.

On physical examination, moderately severe dysphonia characterized primarily by roughness with mild breathiness as well as mild inspiratory stridor were noted. Anterior rhinoscopy demonstrated large, bilateral obstructive nasal polyps. Flexible laryngoscopy revealed smooth, lobulated masses involving the epiglottis and right aryepiglottic fold. The epiglottic component extended inferiorly along the petiole, involving and obstructing the anterior glottis. The vocal fold mucosa was thickened, but bilateral mobility was intact with an adequate posterior glottic airway.

Computed tomography demonstrated homogenous, isodense, laryngeal lesions that correlated with the previously mentioned laryngoscopy findings, but also showed subglottic stenosis approximately 2 cm in length secondary to the thickened intraluminal soft tissue. The cartilaginous laryngotracheal framework was preserved. The chest radiograph was unremarkable. The patient was taken to the operating room for direct laryngoscopy with endoscopic airway dilation and laryngeal mass biopsy.

The biopsy results showed vacuolated macrophages with bacilli and eosinophilic inclusions within plasma cells. This is a characteristic finding of rhinoscleroma, a chronic granulomatous disease caused by Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis.

The patient's history of a "party trick" that involved puffing out his cheeks to force air into his neck with subsequent decompression of air back into his oral cavity by pushing behind his ear is highly suggestive of a diagnosis of spontaneous pneumomediastinum. Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is a condition in which air leaks into the space between the lungs and the chest wall. It can be caused by a number of things, including coughing, straining, and vomiting. In this case, the patient's history of performing his "party trick" multiple times per day is likely what caused the air to leak into his chest.

The patient in this case has bilateral, peripheral light brown corneal opacities. The opacities are located in the far posterior corneae and are present circumferentially. There is no associated keratitis or corneal neovascularization. Anterior segment optical coherence tomographic findings showed focal areas of hyperreflectivity anterior to the Descemet membrane. Confocal microscopy revealed variably shaped, hyperreflective clusters of opacities just anterior to the endothelium.

These findings are consistent with rifabutin-related posterior corneal deposits. Rifabutin is a medication used to treat tuberculosis and other infections caused by Mycobacterium avium complex. It is known to cause posterior corneal deposits, which are typically asymptomatic and do not require treatment. In some cases, the deposits may resolve spontaneously or with time.

In this case, the patient has no visual concerns and her visual acuity is 20/20 OU. There is no evidence of keratitis or corneal neovascularization. The anterior segment optical coherence tomographic findings and confocal microscopy findings are also consistent with a diagnosis of rifabutin-related posterior corneal deposits.

Given the patient's history, clinical presentation, and findings on examination, the most appropriate next step is to reassure the patient and observe. The patient should be advised to return for follow-up in 6 to 12 months to assess for any changes in her condition.

 27%|██▋       | 412/1525 [1:36:23<3:35:04, 11.59s/it]The correct answer is: B. Blood testing for infectious and inflammatory agents.

The patient's presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of anterior optic neuropathy, which can be caused by a variety of conditions, including infectious diseases, inflammatory diseases, and autoimmune diseases. In this case, the patient's history of cyclical fevers, muscle pain, joint swelling, and headache suggests that he may have an underlying infectious or inflammatory condition. Blood testing for infectious and inflammatory agents will help to identify the underlying cause of the patient's optic neuropathy and guide treatment.

Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the neck is not necessary in this case because the patient's MRI of the orbits showed no evidence of vascular disease. Treatment with oral prednisone is a treatment option for patients with optic neuritis, but it is not the first-line treatment for patients with anterior optic neuropathy. Observation is not a recommended treatment option for patients with anterior optic neuropathy because it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's condition.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Blood testing for infectious and inflammatory agents.

The patient also has a family history of thyroid cancer. These findings suggest that the patient may have diabetes-related retinopathy, which is a complication of diabetes that can cause damage to the retina. Diabetes-related retinopathy is a leading cause of blindness in people with diabetes.

Answer: The most appropriate next step is to obtain a family medical history and pursue genetic testing. This will help to determine if the patient has a genetic predisposition to diabetes-related retinopathy. If the patient does have a genetic predisposition, then she may be at an increased risk for developing the condition. Early detection and treatment of diabetes-related retinopathy can help to prevent vision loss.

The other options are not as appropriate as obtaining a family medical history and pursuing genetic testing. Option A, initiating AREDS (Age-Related Eye Disease Study) nutritional supplement treatment for age-related macular degeneration, is not appropriate because the patient does not have age-related macular degeneration. Option B, monitoring retinal pigment abnormalities without further workup, is not appropriate because the patient has a family history of thyroid cancer and may be at an increased risk for developing diabetes-related retinopathy. Option C, referring for intensification of oral therapy for type 2 diabetes, is not appropriate because the patient's diabetes is already being managed with metformin therapy.

He had previously been treated with topical corticosteroid therapy, which provided temporary relief of his symptoms. The patient's visual acuity is 20/20 OU with normal intraocular pressures. The results from the slitlamp examination of the right eye were within normal limits. Examination results of the left eye demonstrated 2+ diffuse conjunctival hyperemia, 1+ anterior chamber cell, and a vascularized iris infiltrate. Results of the dilated fundus examination were within normal limits in both eyes. Ultrasound biomicroscopy of the left eye demonstrated areas of ciliary body thickening 360° and a thickened iris pupillary margin superiorly and nasally. A full review of systems was negative for other abnormalities including skin lesions. Test results for tuberculosis and syphilis were negative.

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is ocular juvenile xanthogranuloma (OJX). OJX is a rare, non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis that typically affects children under the age of 10. However, it can occur in older children and adults, as in this case. OJX is characterized by the proliferation of histiocytes in the skin, eyes, and other organs. The most common ocular manifestation of OJX is a granulomatous uveitis. The granulomas can involve the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. OJX can also cause secondary glaucoma, cataracts, and retinal detachment.

The treatment for OJX is typically with systemic corticosteroids. In some cases, other immunosuppressive agents may be necessary. The prognosis for OJX is generally good, with most patients achieving a good visual outcome. However, OJX can be a sight-threatening condition, and close follow-up is essential.

In this case, the patient's history and examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of OJX. The next step in management is to perform a biopsy of the iris lesion. This will confirm the diagnosis of OJX and allow for the exclusion of other possible causes of the patient's symptoms. Once the diagnosis of OJX is confirmed, the patient can be treated with systemic corticosteroids.

The EGD showed vertical furrows and circumferential rings in the esophagus, which are characteristic of achalasia. Achalasia is a disorder of the esophagus characterized by impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and abnormal contractions of the esophageal body. This results in dysphagia, regurgitation, and chest pain.

The next step in the management of achalasia is to confirm the diagnosis with esophageal high-resolution manometry (HRM). HRM is a test that measures the pressure in the esophagus and LES. It can be used to diagnose achalasia and to assess the severity of the disease.

If HRM confirms the diagnosis of achalasia, the patient can be treated with either pneumatic dilation or surgical myotomy. Pneumatic dilation is a procedure in which a balloon is inflated in the LES to stretch it open. Surgical myotomy is a procedure in which the LES is cut open to allow food to pass through more easily.

In this case, the patient should be referred for esophageal high-resolution manometry (HRM).

The plaque consists of multiple concentric annular formations with raised erythematous margins and studded with numerous blisters and pustules, some coalescing into lakes of pus. Nikolsky sign was not elicited, and oral, ocular, and genital mucosa involvement was absent. The patient did not report other symptoms, and findings of the overall physical examination were normal.

The most likely diagnosis is acute localized exanthematous pustulosis (ALEP). ALEP is a rare, self-limited, pustular eruption that typically occurs in otherwise healthy adults. It is characterized by the sudden onset of multiple, small, sterile pustules on an erythematous base. The pustules typically resolve within 1-2 weeks without scarring.

The diagnosis of ALEP is made clinically, based on the characteristic clinical presentation. Histopathologic examination of the skin lesions may show spongiform pustules in the upper dermis. There is no specific treatment for ALEP, but supportive care, such as oral antibiotics to prevent secondary bacterial infection, may be necessary. The prognosis for ALEP is excellent, with most patients experiencing a complete recovery within 1-2 weeks.

The patient is a woman in her 40s who presents with a 10-year history of progressive skin thickening and subcutaneous enlargement of the right side of her nose and right cheek. She has had nondiagnostic skin biopsies and a septorhinoplasty 6 months prior to presentation. Clinical examination reveals slightly hyperplastic soft tissue with dilated patulous follicles involving the right medial malar cheek and right nasal ala in addition to deviation of the nasal tip. The surgical pathology specimens from her septorhinoplasty were obtained and reviewed.

The differential diagnosis for this patient's presentation includes lupus panniculitis (subcutaneous lupus erythematosus), spindle cell lipoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, and diffuse pattern neurofibroma.

Lupus panniculitis is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the subcutaneous fat. It is characterized by inflammation and fibrosis of the fat tissue. The most common presentation is a painful, erythematous, subcutaneous nodule or plaque. Lupus panniculitis can be associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, but it can also occur as an isolated finding.

Spindle cell lipoma is a benign tumor of adipose tissue. It is characterized by a proliferation of spindle-shaped cells within mature adipocytes. Spindle cell lipomas are typically found in the subcutaneous tissue of the extremities, but they can occur anywhere in the body.

Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is a rare, locally aggressive type of skin cancer. It is characterized by a proliferation of spindle cells within the dermis. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans can occur at any age, but it is most common in adults in their 30s and 40s.

Diffuse pattern neurofibroma is a type of neurofibroma that affects the skin and underlying soft tissues. It is characterized by a proliferation of Schwann cells and fibroblasts. Diffuse pattern neurofibromas are typically found in children and young adults.

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is spindle cell lipoma. The patient's presentation is consistent with this diagnosis, and the surgical pathology specimens from her septorhinoplasty show a proliferation of spindle cells within mature adipocytes.

**Reasoning:**

* The patient is an infant boy who presented with recurrent skin blisters since age 2 months. The lesions initially started over the trunk and subsequently progressed to involve the face, hands, and feet. The episodes of skin blisters were accompanied by pruritus and redness all over the body. There was no history of oral erosions or difficulty in feeding. Bowel and bladder movements were normal. The child had an older sibling who had no skin ailments, and none of the other family members were affected.
* On examination, multiple tense, angulated vesicles and bullae on a background of erythema were seen over the face, trunk, and extremities. Few urticated papules and wheals were seen in isolation over the trunk. The ruptured bullae were healing with hypopigmentation with accompanying scarring and discrete milia formation. The mucosae and nails were normal. No contractures or webbing of fingers was noted. There was no organomegaly. A punch biopsy from a vesicle was subsequently performed.
* The histopathology showed a subepidermal bulla with bandlike mast cell infiltrate in the upper dermis. Mast cells can be identified by ovoid to spindle-shaped nuclei.
* Based on the clinical presentation and histopathology, the most likely diagnosis is bullous mastocytosis. Bullous mastocytosis is a rare, chronic skin disorder characterized by the presence of mast cells in the skin and the formation of blisters. The blisters are usually triggered by minor trauma, such as friction or scratching. They are often accompanied by itching, redness, and swelling. Bullous mastocytosis is most commonly diagnosed in children, but it can occur at any age. The cause of bullous mastocytosis is unknown, but it is thought to be a genetic disorder. There is no cure for bullous mastocytosis, but the symptoms can be managed with medication.

The first-line treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medication, which can help to reduce the severity of symptoms and improve quality of life. Olanzapine and clozapine are both atypical antipsychotics that are effective in treating schizophrenia. Olanzapine is a first-generation antipsychotic that is also effective in treating schizophrenia. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapy that can be used to help people manage their symptoms of schizophrenia. However, CBT is not a first-line treatment for schizophrenia.

Reasoning:

The patient is a 71-year-old man with a 3-year history of a recurrent seronegative autoimmune constrictive pericarditis and pleural effusions, which were treated with pericardiectomy and prednisone and azathioprine. The pleural fluid was transudative and sterile, and the pericardium contained focal lymphoplasmacytic aggregates. Attempts to taper immunosuppressive drugs failed because of a recrudescence of the inflammatory syndrome and pericardial effusion. The patient was admitted with fever of unknown origin with a surge of the inflammatory syndrome and pancytopenia. He reported night sweats beginning 3 weeks prior associated with fever and unintentional weight loss. No lymphadenopathy was noted.

Laboratory evaluations demonstrated a C-reactive protein level of 133 mg/L (reference range, <10 mg/L); ferritin level of 2607 ng/mL (reference, 30-300 ng/mL); lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of 289 U/L (reference, 135-214 U/L); pancytopenia with a hemoglobin level of 9.3 g/dL (reference, 13.3-17.7 g/dL), white blood cell count of 2700/μL (reference, 4000-10 000/μL), and platelet count of 99 ×103/μL (reference, 150-350 ×103/μL); and prerenal acute kidney injury (Acute Kidney Injury Network stage 1) with a serum creatinine level of 1.4 mg/dL (reference, 0.7-1.2 mg/dL). Results of a comprehensive serologic workup were negative. Gastroscopy results showed mycotic distal esophagitis.

The patient was readmitted 3 weeks later with fever and hypotension without improvement despite broad-spectrum antibiotics and antifungals. Considering the increase in ferritin and LDH levels and pancytopenia, a hematologic disease was suspected. The patient did not report any bone pain. Computed tomography (CT) results showed a splenomegaly without evidence of metastatic disease or lymph node enlargement. Positron emission tomography (PET)–CT imaging (Figure, A and B) and a bone-marrow biopsy (Figure, C and D) were performed. A rapidly evolving sepsislike syndrome led to the patient’s death.

Fluorodeoxyglucose/positron emission tomography–computed tomography imaging results show diffuse hypercaptation in the bone marrow (A) and spleen (B). The entire skeleton is highly metabolic, which suggests advanced bone-marrow involvement. C, Bone-marrow biopsy results show a diffuse infiltrate of large lymphoid cells with scattered residual hematopoietic elements (immunoperoxidase, original magnification ×200). D, Immunostaining shows lymphoid infiltrate strongly positive for paired box protein Pax-5 (immunoperoxidase, original magnification ×200).

The differential diagnosis of a patient with fever, pancytopenia, and a bone marrow biopsy showing a diffuse infiltrate of large lymphoid cells includes infectious bone-marrow disease, bone marrow–liver–spleen type of large B-cell lymphoma, primary bone lymphoma, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.

Infectious bone-marrow disease is the most common cause of fever, pancytopenia, and a bone marrow biopsy showing a diffuse infiltrate of large lymphoid cells. The most common infectious causes of bone marrow infiltration are bacterial infections, such as osteomyelitis and septicemia, and viral infections, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection.

Bone marrow–liver–spleen type of large B-cell lymphoma is a rare type of lymphoma that typically presents with fever, pancytopenia, and a bone marrow biopsy showing a diffuse infiltrate of large lymphoid cells. The lymphoma cells typically express the B-cell marker CD20 and the T-cell marker CD56.

Primary bone lymphoma is a rare type of lymphoma that typically presents with pain in the bone or bone marrow biopsy showing a focal infiltrate of large lymphoid cells. The lymphoma cells typically express the B-cell marker CD20 and the T-cell marker CD56.

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is a rare disorder that typically presents with fever, pancytopenia, and a bone marrow biopsy showing a diffuse infiltrate of large lymphoid cells. The lymphoma cells typically express the B-cell marker CD20 and the T-cell marker CD56.

In this case, the patient's history and laboratory findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of bone marrow–liver–spleen type

The patient is a woman in her 30s with active bulimia who was brought by ambulance to the emergency department after a syncopal event that followed 1 hour of palpitations and intermittent lightheadedness. She was found to be in a regular wide complex tachycardia with a heart rate of 225 beats per minute. The patient was oriented but slow to respond. After sedation, a synchronized, biphasic, 200-J shock converted her to sinus rhythm with bigeminy, which settled to normal sinus rhythm. An intravenous amiodarone infusion was administered. Her initial laboratory evaluation revealed hypokalemia (2.8 mEq/L), hypomagnesemia (3.6 mEq/L), and an elevated serum troponin (0.13 nanograms per milliliter). Potassium and magnesium replacement was administered orally and intravenously. She reported no family history of sudden cardiac death or unexplained premature death. A transthoracic echocardiogram showed normal biventricular size and function.

The next step in management is to determine the cause of the wide complex tachycardia. The most likely cause is an electrolyte derangement, such as hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia. The patient's history of bulimia suggests that she may have been purging, which can lead to electrolyte imbalances. The elevated serum troponin is concerning for myocardial ischemia, but it is important to note that this can be a non-specific finding in patients with electrolyte abnormalities.

The next step is to perform ambulatory cardiac monitoring after electrolyte repletion. This will help to determine if the patient has any arrhythmias that are not present during the initial evaluation. If the patient is found to have arrhythmias, further testing, such as cardiac magnetic resonance imaging or invasive electrophysiology study, may be necessary to determine the cause of the arrhythmias and to guide treatment.

The patient is a 0-day-old female neonate who exhibited loud stridor and respiratory distress at birth. The pregnancy was uncomplicated, and prenatal ultrasonography results were normal. After spontaneous vaginal delivery at 37 weeks’ gestation, the neonate immediately developed tachypnea, severe retractions, barking cough, hoarse cry, and dusky appearance with oxygen desaturations to 60%, which required continuous positive airway pressure. Despite respiratory support, she was intubated within the first hour of life. The intubating clinician noted a large flesh-colored laryngeal mass and placed a size 3.5 uncuffed endotracheal tube. Ear, nose, and throat evaluation noted that the neonate was intubated and ventilating easily. No craniofacial abnormalities or obvious oral cavity, oropharyngeal, or neck masses were present. Chest radiography was obtained, and results were normal. The patient was subsequently taken to the operating room for direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy. Intraoperative evaluation revealed a large submucosal mass involving the left side of the epiglottis, false fold, aryepiglottic fold, and arytenoid that was soft and fluctuant on palpation (Figure 1).

The differential diagnosis for a large laryngeal mass in a neonate includes congenital anomalies, infectious processes, inflammatory conditions, and neoplasms. Congenital anomalies that can present with a laryngeal mass include laryngomalacia, tracheomalacia, and laryngeal webs. Infectious processes that can involve the larynx include viral croup, bacterial tracheitis, and epiglottitis. Inflammatory conditions that can affect the larynx include laryngeal papillomatosis and Wegener granulomatosis. Neoplasms that can occur in the larynx include hemangiomas, lymphangiomas, and neurofibromas.

The patient in this case has a large, submucosal mass involving the left side of the epiglottis, false fold, aryepiglottic fold, and arytenoid. The mass is soft and fluctuant on palpation, which suggests a cystic lesion. The most likely diagnosis in this case is a lateral saccular cyst. Lateral saccular cysts are benign, congenital lesions that arise from the mucosa of the larynx. They are typically located on the lateral aspect of the epiglottis or aryepiglottic fold. Lateral saccular cysts can present with stridor, hoarseness, and dysphagia. Treatment is usually surgical excision.

The patient's history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in the left parotid gland and hypopharynx, as well as the presence of osseous destruction of the left temporal bone on imaging studies, are all suggestive of a malignant tumor. The histopathologic findings of myogenin-positive spindle cells with no tumor necrosis, in addition to desmin-positive and CD34-positive cells, are characteristic of spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma.

Malignant fibrous histiocytoma is a rare soft tissue sarcoma that can occur in any part of the body, but it is most common in the extremities. It is a high-grade tumor with a poor prognosis. Paraganglioma is a neuroendocrine tumor that can occur in the head and neck, as well as other parts of the body. It is a slow-growing tumor with a good prognosis. Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that can occur in the skin, lungs, esophagus, and other parts of the body. It is the most common type of cancer in the world.

The patient's history and imaging studies are not consistent with a diagnosis of malignant fibrous histiocytoma, paraganglioma, or squamous cell carcinoma. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma.

The patient is a 25-year-old woman with a 6-month history of an enlarging right neck mass. The mass is nontender, compressible, and deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The patient also reports waxing and waning pain that radiates to the back of her neck, headaches, and intermittent dysphagia. She also noted periods during which the mass would fluctuate in size.

A computed tomography (CT) scan showed a fatty-appearing tumor within the right carotid space. The patient underwent surgical excision, and a mass measuring 8.0 × 6.5 × 4.7–cm was removed from the carotid space. Additional material from the mass was excised at the level of the base of the skull.

Gross pathologic examination demonstrated yellowish-brown, homogenous, lobular adipose tissue covered by a thin, tan, transparent membrane. Histopathologic examination showed relatively uniform univacuolar and multivacuolated, granular eosinophilic cells with centrally placed nucleoli.

The most likely diagnosis is lipoma. Lipomas are benign tumors of adipose tissue. They are the most common soft tissue tumor, accounting for approximately 20% of all soft tissue tumors. Lipomas are usually solitary, but they can be multiple. They are most commonly found in the trunk and extremities, but they can occur anywhere in the body.

Lipomas are typically soft and compressible. They are usually painless, but they can become painful if they are large or if they are irritated. Lipomas are usually slow-growing, but they can grow rapidly in some cases.

The diagnosis of lipoma is usually made on clinical grounds. A CT scan or MRI scan can be helpful in confirming the diagnosis. Treatment of lipoma is usually not necessary, but surgery can be performed to remove the tumor if it is large or if it is causing symptoms.

 28%|██▊       | 426/1525 [1:39:48<4:43:12, 15.46s/it]Reasoning: The patient has acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) with sudden loss of vision. APL is a type of leukemia that is characterized by the presence of promyelocytes, which are immature white blood cells. Promyelocytes can release a substance called promyeloperoxidase (PML), which can damage blood vessels in the retina. This damage can lead to retinal hemorrhages and detachments, which can cause sudden vision loss.

The patient is currently receiving chemotherapy with ATRA and arsenic trioxide. ATRA is a drug that causes promyelocytes to mature into normal white blood cells. Arsenic trioxide is a drug that kills promyelocytes. Both of these drugs can help to reduce the amount of PML in the blood and prevent further damage to the retina.

However, the patient has already experienced sudden vision loss. This suggests that the damage to the retina has already occurred. In this situation, it is important to stop the ATRA and start steroids. Steroids can help to reduce inflammation and swelling in the retina. This can help to improve vision and prevent further damage.

The patient should also have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits with and without contrast and a lumbar puncture. This is to rule out any other causes of the vision loss, such as a brain tumor or meningitis.

 28%|██▊       | 427/1525 [1:40:02<4:32:31, 14.89s/it]The correct answer is: **B: Administer intravitreal foscarnet and admit for intravenous acyclovir.**

The patient has a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that was treated with chemotherapy, followed by a relapse that required additional chemotherapy and ultimately autologous bone marrow transplant 3 months before presentation. At the time of presentation, he was taking no immunosuppressive medications and was taking prophylactic acyclovir, 800 mg twice daily, and sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (800 mg/160 mg) 3 times weekly.

The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis, a common opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients. The diagnosis is supported by the findings of vitritis, retinal hemorrhages, and retinal necrosis on fundus examination. The patient's white blood cell count is moderately low, which is a risk factor for CMV retinitis.

The first-line treatment for CMV retinitis is intravitreal foscarnet. Foscarnet is a potent antiviral agent that is effective against CMV. It is administered intravitreally, which allows it to reach high concentrations in the vitreous humor, where CMV replicates.

Intravenous acyclovir is also effective against CMV, but it is not as effective as foscarnet. It is typically used in combination with foscarnet to treat CMV retinitis in patients who are intolerant of foscarnet or who have failed treatment with foscarnet.

Panretinal photocoagulation is a surgical procedure that is used to treat retinal neovascularization. It is not indicated for the treatment of CMV retinitis.

Therefore, the correct answer is: **B: Administer intravitreal foscarnet and admit for intravenous acyclovir.**

The patient has a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) with transformation to large B-cell lymphoma that was treated with rituximab, adriamycin, vincristine sulfate, and prednisone chemotherapy 4 years earlier. Two years before referral, bladder cancer was diagnosed and was treated surgically and with multiple rounds of intravesical BCG immunotherapy. The most recent BCG treatment was 5 months before presentation to the Ocular Oncology Service at Wills Eye Hospital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
The patient's medical history is significant for a history of malignancy, which increases the risk of developing a second malignancy. The patient also has a rapidly enlarging fleshy nodule of the right nasal conjunctiva that does not respond to oral prednisone therapy. These findings are concerning for a malignant neoplasm.

 28%|██▊       | 429/1525 [1:40:25<3:52:39, 12.74s/it]The correct answer is: Start oral antiviral and topical antibiotic therapy.

Reasoning:
The patient has a history of herpes simplex keratitis and has a corneal ulcer with positive bacterial cultures for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. This suggests that the patient has a mixed infection with both a virus and bacteria. Therefore, the patient should be started on both oral antiviral and topical antibiotic therapy.

Oral antiviral therapy will help to treat the viral infection, while topical antibiotic therapy will help to treat the bacterial infection. This is the most appropriate treatment for a patient with a mixed infection of the cornea.

Admitting the patient for intravenous antiviral therapy is not necessary, as the patient can be treated effectively with oral antiviral therapy. Additionally, the patient does not have any signs or symptoms that would warrant admission to the hospital, such as fever, severe pain, or vision loss.

Starting topical antibiotics alone would not be adequate treatment for this patient, as the patient has a mixed infection with both a virus and bacteria. Starting oral antiviral therapy alone would also not be adequate treatment, as the patient has a bacterial infection that requires topical antibiotic therapy. Therefore, the patient should be started on both oral antiviral and topical antibiotic therapy.

He has been treated with various therapies, including prednisone, methotrexate, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, abatacept, and anakinra, but has had only intermittent improvement in his joint pain. He has also developed intermittent fevers, diarrhea, and weight loss. On examination, he has subtle synovitis in bilateral metacarpophalangeal joints. Laboratory evaluation is notable for a normocytic anemia and elevated C-reactive protein level. Results of esophagogastroduodenoscopy with gastric biopsies and bone marrow biopsy were unremarkable. Findings on further workup including transthoracic echocardiography to assess for endocarditis, carotid magnetic resonance angiography to assess for vasculitis, and abdominal fat pad biopsy for amyloidosis were also unremarkable. Tocilizumab was initiated, but the patient's symptoms continued to progress. He developed intermittent abdominal pain, steatorrhea, protein-losing enteropathy, and symmetric bilateral lower extremity edema requiring diuresis. Results of infectious stool studies, celiac serology, and fecal elastase testing were normal. Repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed, with gastric and duodenal biopsies. The duodenal biopsies showed features of lymphocytic duodenitis.

The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are consistent with the diagnosis of celiac disease. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder that occurs in individuals who are genetically susceptible. It is characterized by an immune reaction to gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. The immune reaction damages the lining of the small intestine, resulting in malabsorption of nutrients.

The patient's treatment should focus on removing gluten from his diet. This will allow the lining of his small intestine to heal and improve his nutrient absorption. He should also be treated for any complications of celiac disease, such as anemia and osteoporosis.

The answer is D: Refer to a nutritionist for education on gluten-free diet.

Ascaris is the most common human helminth infection, with an estimated 1.5 billion people infected worldwide. The worms live in the small intestine and can migrate to the biliary tree, causing obstruction and inflammation. The patient's laboratory findings show elevated liver enzymes, which are consistent with cholangitis. The abdominal ultrasound and ERCP findings show linear filling defects within the common bile duct, which are also consistent with cholangitis.

Answer: C. Order polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for Ascaris.

PCR is a highly sensitive and specific test for the detection of Ascaris DNA. It is the preferred test for diagnosing Ascaris infection. Antibiotics are not indicated for the treatment of Ascaris infection. Anthelminthic therapy is the mainstay of treatment. The most commonly used anthelminthic for Ascaris infection is mebendazole.

The patient is a girl in her teens who presented with a unilateral itchy nodule on her right labium majus of 4 months’ duration. The patient was born and lived in a rural village in Malawi. Her medical and family history were unremarkable. She did not report fever or malaise. Physical examination revealed a polypoid, rubbery tumor measuring 1.5 cm located on her right labium majus, which obliterated the right labium minus. She did not present with enlarged lymph nodes, and results of the physical examination were otherwise unremarkable. An incisional lesional biopsy was taken.

The histopathologic analysis of the nodule showed pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia with transepidermal elimination of basophilic oval-shaped structures in the epidermis and a dense acute and chronic dermal infiltrate in the dermis. Numerous dermal structures surrounded by a dense acute and chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate with granuloma formation were also noted. High-power magnification of the oval parasitic structures revealed a typical terminal spine.

Based on the clinical presentation and the histopathologic findings, the most likely diagnosis is granuloma inguinale. Granuloma inguinale is a chronic, sexually transmitted disease caused by the bacterium Calymmatobacterium granulomatis. The disease is characterized by the development of granulomatous lesions in the genital or perianal region. The lesions are typically painless and friable, and they may ulcerate. Granuloma inguinale is most common in tropical and subtropical regions, and it is often seen in association with HIV infection.

The treatment of granuloma inguinale is with antibiotics, such as doxycycline or azithromycin. The lesions typically respond well to treatment, but they may recur if treatment is not completed.

The patient is a man in his 30s who presented with a 3-month history of gradual growth of a pruriginous, reddish nodule on the left ear. He had no relevant medical history. On medical examination, a reddish, smooth, superficial nodule with small dimples and a soft consistency that measured approximately 1.5 cm in diameter was seen on the left earlobe. It was not painful to the touch. The patient reported no history of lesions or foreign bodies at this location. A biopsy specimen was obtained for histopathologic analysis.

The histopathologic findings reveal mixed diffuse dermatitis involving the reticular dermis, with small-vessel vasculitis, characteristic sparing of a superficial dermal grenz zone as well as the dilated vessel luminal, and mixed leukocytic infiltrate with eosinophils, lymphocytes, and neutrophils involving the full thickness of the vessel wall.

These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia (ALHE). ALHE is a rare, benign, inflammatory condition that typically affects the head and neck, particularly the ears. It is characterized by the presence of small, reddish nodules that are often pruritic. The nodules may be solitary or multiple, and they may vary in size.

The cause of ALHE is unknown, but it is thought to be an immune-mediated disorder. The condition is more common in women than men, and it typically occurs in people in their 30s and 40s.

There is no specific treatment for ALHE, but the condition often resolves on its own. In some cases, treatment with steroids or other medications may be necessary.

The patient is a 34-year-old man with a history of headache, double vision, seizures, and altered consciousness. He has facial flushing and grade III clubbing in his fingers and toes. His chest and cardiovascular examination results are normal. He has ptosis in his right eye. The right eye is deviated laterally secondary to right-medial rectus palsy. His pupil size and pupillary light reactions are normal. He also has grade II papilledema. His motor and sensory examination results are normal; however, he has brisk deep-tendon jerks and extensor planter responses. There are no meningeal signs. His cranial magnetic resonance image showed 2 ring-enhancing lesions in the right frontal and left parietal cortexes, along with surrounding brain edema and mass effects. Both lesions showed a thin-walled, contrast-enhancing rim with a central liquefaction. The central liquefaction showed restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images. His hemoglobin level was 19.3 grams per deciliter, his total leukocyte count was 13 500/μL, his hematocrit was 62.4%, and his platelet count was 210 000/μL. He had normal liver and renal function test results. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV was nonreactive. A radiograph of his chest showed a nodular shadow in the left middle field of the lung. The 2-dimensional echocardiogram did not show any evidence of congenital heart disease. An arterial blood gas test result showed an oxygen saturation level of 80%. His blood cultures were found to be sterile.

The most likely diagnosis is pyogenic brain abscesses. The patient's history of headache, double vision, seizures, and altered consciousness is consistent with a space-occupying lesion in the brain. The cranial magnetic resonance image shows 2 ring-enhancing lesions in the right frontal and left parietal cortexes, which are characteristic of pyogenic brain abscesses. The central liquefaction of the lesions shows restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images, which is also consistent with pyogenic brain abscesses. The patient's blood cultures were found to be sterile, which suggests that the brain abscesses are not caused by a bacterial infection.

The differential diagnosis for pyogenic brain abscesses includes other space-occupying lesions in the brain, such as tumors, granulomas, and cysts. However, the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are not consistent with these other diagnoses.

The treatment for pyogenic brain abscesses is surgical drainage and antibiotic therapy. The patient should be started on broad-spectrum antibiotics that cover a variety of possible pathogens, such as staphylococci, streptococci, and anaerobes. The antibiotics should be adjusted based on the results of the cultures. The patient may also need to be treated with corticosteroids to reduce cerebral edema.

The prognosis for patients with pyogenic brain abscesses is variable, depending on the size and location of the abscesses, the underlying cause, and the patient's overall health. With prompt diagnosis and treatment, the majority of patients make a good recovery. However, some patients may have permanent neurological deficits.

The patient is a middle-aged man with a history of hereditary spherocytosis, polycythemia vera, hemochromatosis, hypereosinophilia, and asymptomatic paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia. He presents with dyspnea that has been worsening over the past 4 weeks. The patient has no chest pain, palpitations, cough, fever, or hemoptysis. His physical examination is significant for tachypnea, a soft systolic murmur with a brief diastolic component, and jugular venous distension. His laboratory results show leukocytosis with eosinophilia, a normal hemoglobin level, and a normal platelet count. His chest radiography results are suggestive of pulmonary vascular congestion. The echocardiogram results show a normal left ventricular ejection fraction with no substantial wall motion abnormalities. There is an echogenic band traversing the apical portion of the left ventricle with increased echogenicity compared with the adjacent myocardium.

The differential diagnosis for this patient's presentation includes infiltrative cardiomyopathy, myocarditis, and noncompaction cardiomyopathy. Infiltrative cardiomyopathy is a condition in which the myocardium is infiltrated with abnormal cells, such as lymphocytes, plasma cells, or malignant cells. Myocarditis is an inflammation of the myocardium. Noncompaction cardiomyopathy is a congenital heart defect characterized by a thin, poorly developed myocardium in the apical and mid-ventricular segments of the left ventricle.

The echocardiogram findings in this patient are most consistent with noncompaction cardiomyopathy. The presence of an echogenic band traversing the apical portion of the left ventricle with increased echogenicity compared with the adjacent myocardium is a characteristic finding of noncompaction cardiomyopathy.

The next step in the management of this patient is to perform cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Cardiac MRI is a more sensitive and specific test than echocardiography for the diagnosis of noncompaction cardiomyopathy. Cardiac MRI can also provide information about the extent of the noncompaction and the function of the left ventricle.

The patient is a 7-month-old male infant with a firm, irregularly shaped posterior neck mass. He had been diagnosed prenatally with cerebellar hypoplasia, so a magnetic resonance imaging study of the brain was performed at 1 month of age. This study demonstrated an incidental solid, homogenous mass in the subcutaneous fat of the right occiput with irregular borders and infiltration into the paraspinal musculature. On examination, the upper posterior neck mass was deep to palpation without overlying skin changes. The patient had no discomfort, and neck movement was not restricted.

The differential diagnosis for a posterior neck mass in a child includes lipoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, infantile hemangioma, and glial heterotopia. Lipomas are the most common soft tissue tumor in children, and they are typically benign. Rhabdomyosarcomas are malignant soft tissue tumors that can occur in any part of the body, including the neck. Infantile hemangiomas are benign vascular tumors that are common in newborns and infants. Glial heterotopias are benign tumors of the brain that can occur in the posterior fossa.

In this case, the patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of glial heterotopia. The patient's prenatal diagnosis of cerebellar hypoplasia is also consistent with a diagnosis of glial heterotopia, as glial heterotopias are often associated with other congenital anomalies of the brain. The magnetic resonance imaging study shows a solid, homogenous mass in the subcutaneous fat of the right occiput with irregular borders and infiltration into the paraspinal musculature. This finding is also consistent with a diagnosis of glial heterotopia.

The patient is a 31-year-old Hispanic woman with a 3-year history of a steadily growing, increasingly pruritic, painless mass behind the right ear. She denies bleeding from the mass, ear pain, trauma, fever, fatigue, night sweats, or recent illnesses. Her medical history includes eczema treated with triamcinolone acetonide cream. Otherwise, the patient has no family history or exposure to tobacco or alcohol.

On physical examination, a 2-cm, nontender, mobile retroauricular mass with superficial excoriations is palpable over the right mastoid cortex. The patient has no hearing deficits and no fistula into the external auditory canal. There is no palpable head and neck lymphadenopathy.

Serologic studies reveal an elevated absolute eosinophil count of 790/μL (reference range, <700/μL; to convert to ×109 per liter, multiply by 0.001) and an eosinophilia percentage of 9.7% (reference range, <6.0%). The T1-weighted postcontrast magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck showed a heterogeneously enhancing mass with irregular borders in the right retroauricular space, with a tract coursing anteriorly toward the parotid gland.

The excised mass was an enlarged, 2.2 × 1.5 × 2.2-cm lymph node with a smooth, pale core and no hemorrhage or necrosis. The capsule was moderately thickened by collagen fibrosis with focal areas of interstitial fibrosis. Reactive follicular hyperplasia was present with prominent eosinophilia in the interfollicular areas and within follicles, forming eosinophilic microabscesses and follicular cysts. A few small and ill-defined granulomas were present. Results of Gomori methenamine silver and acid-fast stains were negative.

The most likely diagnosis is Kimura disease. Kimura disease is a rare, idiopathic, lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia, and angioedema. It is most common in young men of Asian descent, but it can occur in people of all races and ethnicities. The exact cause of Kimura disease is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder.

The clinical features of Kimura disease vary from person to person. The most common symptoms are lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia, and angioedema. Lymphadenopathy is the most common presenting symptom, and it is usually found in the head and neck region. Eosinophilia is also common, and it can be severe. Angioedema is less common than lymphadenopathy and eosinophilia, but it can be life-threatening.

The diagnosis of Kimura disease is made based on the clinical features and the results of laboratory tests. The most important laboratory test is the peripheral blood eosinophil count, which is usually elevated. Other laboratory tests that may be helpful include the serum IgE level, the serum IgG4 level, and the serum complement level.

The treatment of Kimura disease is not curative, but it can be effective in controlling the symptoms. The most common treatment is a combination of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs. Other treatments that may be used include surgery, radiation therapy, and plasmapheresis.

The prognosis for Kimura disease is variable. Some people have mild disease that responds well to treatment, while others have severe disease that is resistant to treatment. The long-term complications of Kimura disease include lymphadenopathy, fibrosis, and organomegaly.

These are features of sebaceous carcinoma, a malignant tumor of the sebaceous glands. Sebaceous carcinoma is a rare but aggressive tumor with a high risk of metastasis. The treatment of choice is surgical excision with clear margins. In this case, the lesion is located on the eyelid margin, which makes it difficult to achieve clear margins with a simple excision. Therefore, a full-thickness eyelid resection with intraoperative control of margins is the best option.

The physical examination findings of petechiae, ecchymosis, and hematomas are consistent with a bleeding disorder. The laboratory test results show a normocytic anemia, a normal platelet count, and a mild leukopenia. The folic acid level is low and the vitamin B12 level is normal. Results for iron panel, reticulocyte count, PT, APTT, INR, liver function tests, and levels of indirect bilirubin, haptoglobin, fibrinogen, and creatine kinase are all within reference range. Chest radiographs and computed tomography of the head are negative for any acute pathology. A 12-lead electrocardiogram revealed no abnormalities. Ultrasound of both lower legs showed no thromboembolism.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to order additional coagulation tests, such as thrombin time and platelet function assay. These tests will help to determine the specific nature of the patient's coagulopathy. If the patient's coagulopathy is due to a deficiency of a specific coagulation factor, then treatment with that factor may be indicated. If the patient's coagulopathy is due to an underlying disorder, such as liver disease or vitamin deficiency, then treatment of the underlying disorder may be necessary.

He has already been given a series of doses of intravenous adenosine (6 mg, 12 mg, 12 mg), followed by direct current cardioversion at 200 J, which converted the rhythm to sinus for approximately 3 minutes. Intravenous metoprolol and intravenous diltiazem bolus and drip were then administered, which slowed the heart rate but did not terminate the arrhythmia. A rapid strep test result was positive, and he was given ampicillin.

The next step in management is to repeat synchronized direct current cardioversion at 200 J. This is because the patient has a narrow complex tachycardia that is refractory to medical therapy. Direct current cardioversion is a safe and effective treatment for SVT. It is important to note that the patient's heart rate is 241/min, which is a rapid heart rate that can lead to complications such as heart failure, stroke, and death. Therefore, it is important to treat the patient's arrhythmia as soon as possible.

The patient is a middle-aged woman with a 4- to 5-year history of mildly pruritic coalescent yellowish papules around the umbilicus. She is obese and multiparous. Examination of the rest of the integument, systemic examination, and investigations including fundoscopy, electrocardiogram, and stool examination for occult blood revealed no significant abnormalities. Dermoscopic examination was performed (polarized mode, Dinolite) as shown in Figure 1B. We obtained a 4-mm punch biopsy from one of the papules for diagnostic clarification (Figure 1C).

The clinical presentation of the patient is consistent with periumbilical pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE). PXE is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the deposition of abnormal elastic fibers in the skin, eyes, and cardiovascular system. The skin lesions of PXE are typically yellowish papules or plaques that occur in a periumbilical distribution. They may be pruritic, but are usually asymptomatic. The diagnosis of PXE is made clinically and confirmed by histopathologic examination, which shows the characteristic deposition of abnormal elastic fibers in the papillary and reticular dermis.

The dermoscopic features of PXE include curvilinear brown pigment lines, accentuation of the normal pigmentary network, and absence of follicular plugging or linear vessels. The histopathologic features of PXE include the characteristic deposition of abnormal elastic fibers in the papillary and reticular dermis.

In the patient described above, the clinical presentation, dermoscopic features, and histopathologic findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of PXE. The differential diagnosis of PXE includes periumbilical pseudoxanthoma elasticum–like papillary dermal elastolysis, elastosis perforans serpiginosa, and late-onset focal dermal elastosis. However, these disorders do not typically present with the characteristic clinical features of PXE, such as the periumbilical distribution of the lesions and the absence of follicular plugging or linear vessels.

The patient is an elderly woman with a 6-month history of an asymptomatic, enlarging, partly infiltrated erythematous cutaneous patch localized to the periareolar area of her left breast. She has no history of cancer or chronic diseases. Physical examination did not show adenopathies, hepatosplenomegaly, or other remarkable findings. Peripheral blood test results were within normal limits. Tests for tumor markers including cancer antigen (CA) 15-3, carcinoembryonic antigen, CA 19-9, and CA 125 were unremarkable. No palpable breast masses were identifiable. Breast ultrasonography and mammography did not reveal parenchymal nodules. A local steroid therapy was administered, with no benefit. A biopsy of the skin lesion was performed.

The clinical image of the cutaneous breast lesion shows a large, erythematous, and slightly infiltrated patch in the periareolar region. The hematoxylin-eosin–stained lesional specimens show a dense dermal infiltrate of cells with focal epidermis involvement and large atypical cells with scanty cytoplasm.

These findings are most consistent with the diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma. Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare, aggressive neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin. It is most common in elderly people, with a median age at diagnosis of 70 years. The most common presenting symptom is a painless skin nodule, which may be erythematous or violaceous. Other symptoms may include itching, tenderness, and ulceration. Merkel cell carcinoma is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, and the prognosis is poor.

The differential diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma includes other types of cutaneous lymphoma, such as primary cutaneous large B-cell lymphoma, leg type, and cutaneous angiosarcoma. However, the clinical and histopathologic features of Merkel cell carcinoma are most consistent with this diagnosis.

He also has mild cognitive decline, orofacial dyskinesia, involuntary vocalizations, mild dysarthria, and a mildly wide-based gait. Laboratory examination results reveal elevated CK levels and slightly decreased low-density lipoprotein and apolipoprotein B levels. Acanthocytes are found in the blood smear. Electrophysiological examination results reveal reduced compound muscle action potential and sensory nerve action potential of bilateral median and ulnar nerves. Electromyogram results show neurogenic damage in lower limb muscles. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging results reveal a marked bilateral caudate head atrophy.

The patient's history and examination findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of chorea-acanthocytosis. Chorea-acanthocytosis is a rare, inherited disorder characterized by chorea (involuntary, irregular, and jerky movements), acanthocytes (abnormal red blood cells with thorny projections), and neuropsychiatric symptoms. The disease is caused by mutations in the chorea-acanthocytosis protein gene (CHAC).

The patient's age of onset (23 years old) is consistent with the typical age of onset for chorea-acanthocytosis. His symptoms are also consistent with the disease, including involuntary orofaciolingual movements, dysphagia, dysarthria, involuntary tongue- and lip-biting, mild cognitive decline, and gait disturbance. The laboratory findings, including elevated CK levels and slightly decreased low-density lipoprotein and apolipoprotein B levels, are also consistent with chorea-acanthocytosis. The acanthocytes seen on the blood smear are a classic finding in the disease. The electrophysiological and magnetic resonance imaging findings are also consistent with a diagnosis of chorea-acanthocytosis.

The patient has a history of two strokes, the most recent of which was 6 months ago. He has a dual-chamber pacemaker that was implanted 7 months ago. The chest X-ray shows that the ventricular lead is in a suspicious position, suggesting that it may be in the left ventricle. This could explain the patient's strokes, as a left ventricular pacemaker lead can cause thromboembolism.

A transthoracic echocardiogram is the best test to evaluate the position of the ventricular lead. It can also assess for any structural abnormalities of the heart that could be contributing to the patient's strokes.

Screening for thrombophilia is not necessary in this case, as the patient has no other risk factors for thromboembolism. Prolonged Holter monitoring is not necessary, as the patient's electrocardiogram shows atrial pacing with capture and intrinsic ventricular conduction, which is normal. Taking serial blood cultures is not necessary, as there is no evidence of infection.

Therefore, the next step in the management of this patient is to obtain a transthoracic echocardiogram to evaluate the position of the ventricular lead.

The nevus has not changed in size or appearance, and the patient is asymptomatic. However, a new retro-orbital hypoechoic cavity causing right globe deformation was noted on B-scan ultrasonography. This finding is concerning for a choroidal melanoma, which is a type of eye cancer.

A fluorescein angiography is a test that can be used to visualize the blood vessels in the eye. It is not necessary in this case, as the patient has no symptoms and the nevus has not changed in size or appearance.

Obtaining orbital imaging, such as a CT scan or MRI, would be helpful to further evaluate the retro-orbital hypoechoic cavity. This imaging could help to determine the size, shape, and location of the cavity, as well as any other abnormalities in the orbit.

Recommending a liver biopsy is not necessary in this case. The patient has no symptoms of liver disease, and the choroidal nevus is not a type of cancer that typically metastasizes to the liver.

The best course of action is to monitor the patient with follow-up in 6 months. This will allow the doctor to observe the nevus for any changes in size, appearance, or symptoms. If the nevus does change, further testing, such as a fluorescein angiography or orbital imaging, may be necessary.

The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of hypertension who presented to the emergency department with blurry vision in her right eye for a duration of 2 weeks. Her visual acuity with correction was 20/40 OD and 20/25 OS. Her intraocular pressures were 14 mm Hg OD and 15 mm Hg OS. A dilated fundus examination of the right eye was notable for an amelanotic choroidal mass with overlying subretinal fluid. Results of a dilated fundus examination of the left eye were unremarkable. Results of fluorescein angiographic imaging of the right eye showed late leakage corresponding to the choroidal mass; the left eye was unremarkable. Optical coherence tomography demonstrated a choroidal mass with an irregular surface contour and a mild overlying vitreous cell. On B-scan ultrasonography of the right eye, a superotemporal choroidal mass with an irregular surface contour and medium internal reflectivity was observed. On further questioning, the patient reported a 9 pack-year smoking history. She had no known history of malignant conditions. She denied recent fevers, chills, weight loss, night sweats, and travel to foreign countries, and she was otherwise feeling well.

The differential diagnosis for an amelanotic choroidal mass includes primary choroidal tumors (such as melanoma, hemangioma, and metastasis), metastatic tumors, and inflammatory conditions (such as sarcoidosis and tuberculosis). Given the patient's history of hypertension, smoking, and lack of known metastatic disease, the most likely diagnosis is a primary choroidal tumor.

The next step in the management of this patient is to obtain a biopsy of the choroidal mass to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate treatment. A pars plana vitrectomy and biopsy is the most accurate way to obtain a tissue diagnosis of a choroidal mass.

Reasoning:

The patient has widespread painful purpura, which is a clinical sign of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). DIC is a life-threatening disorder that occurs when the body's clotting system becomes activated and uncontrolled. This can lead to the formation of small blood clots throughout the body, which can block blood flow and cause organ damage.

One of the laboratory findings that can be seen in DIC is the presence of cryoglobulins. Cryoglobulins are proteins that precipitate in the cold. They can be found in the blood of patients with a variety of autoimmune diseases, infections, and malignancies.

In the patient described in the case, the presence of widespread painful purpura, an elevated white blood cell count, and a low platelet count are all suggestive of DIC. The finding of cryoglobulins in the blood would confirm the diagnosis.

Treatment for DIC is aimed at controlling the underlying cause and preventing the formation of further blood clots. This may involve medications such as heparin and steroids. In some cases, plasmapheresis may be necessary to remove the cryoglobulins from the blood.

The patient in the case should be tested for serum cryoglobulin level to confirm the diagnosis of DIC. This will allow for prompt initiation of treatment and improve the patient's outcome.

The patient is a girl in her teens with asymptomatic, punctate, keratotic papules localized to the right palm and right third proximal finger that have been present since age 2 years. Prior treatments included cryotherapy, pulsed dye laser, and 40% salicylic acid, with partial improvement reported but never complete clearance. Medical history and family history are unremarkable. Physical examination revealed grouped and circumscribed, firm, skin-colored, 1- to 3-mm papules with a central punctate dark core. A 4-mm punch biopsy from a papule on the palm was performed.

The differential diagnosis for punctate keratotic papules on the palm includes porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus, punctate palmoplantar keratoderma, familial comedonal Darier disease, and nevus comedonicus.

Porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus is a rare, benign condition characterized by small, grouped, keratotic papules on the palms and soles. The papules are typically located at the openings of eccrine sweat glands and may be associated with a linear or whorled distribution. Histologically, porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus is characterized by dilation of the eccrine ducts and the presence of keratinous plugs within the ducts.

Punctate palmoplantar keratoderma is a group of inherited disorders characterized by thickened, keratotic skin on the palms and soles. The severity of the disease can vary from mild to severe. Histologically, punctate palmoplantar keratoderma is characterized by hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and papillomatosis of the epidermis.

Familial comedonal Darier disease is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder characterized by comedones and keratotic papules on the palms and soles. The comedones are typically located on the face and trunk, while the keratotic papules are typically located on the palms and soles. Histologically, familial comedonal Darier disease is characterized by the presence of comedones and keratotic plugs within the follicles.

Nevus comedonicus is a rare, benign condition characterized by comedones and keratotic papules on the face, neck, and upper trunk. The comedones are typically located on the face, while the keratotic papules are typically located on the neck and upper trunk. Histologically, nevus comedonicus is characterized by the presence of comedones and keratotic plugs within the follicles.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus. This is based on the patient's history of asymptomatic, punctate, keratotic papules localized to the right palm and right third proximal finger that have been present since age 2 years. Prior treatments including cryotherapy, pulsed dye laser, and 40% salicylic acid have resulted in partial improvement but never complete clearance. The patient's medical history and family history are unremarkable. Physical examination revealed grouped and circumscribed, firm, skin-colored, 1- to 3-mm papules with a central punctate dark core.

The patient's history of remote coronary artery bypass grafting and recent percutaneous coronary intervention with a drug-eluting stent place him at risk for atrioventricular (AV) block. His ambulatory ECG monitoring results showed 31 episodes of high-grade AV block, with ventricular pauses ranging from 3.0 to 13.0 seconds occurring during the day and at night. Among them, 4 episodes were associated with presyncope. These findings are consistent with symptomatic AV block.

The next step in management is to discontinue metoprolol tartrate, which can worsen AV block. Repeating the ambulatory ECG after discontinuing metoprolol tartrate will help to determine if the AV block is reversible.

Reasoning:

The patient has bilateral retinal detachments, which is a medical emergency. The goal of treatment is to reattach the retina as soon as possible to prevent permanent vision loss. The first line of treatment is usually intravitreal triamcinolone, which is a corticosteroid that can be injected into the vitreous cavity of the eye. Intravitreal triamcinolone can help to reduce inflammation and edema, which can help to reattach the retina.

If intravitreal triamcinolone is not successful, other treatment options may be considered, such as a pars plana vitrectomy with a chorioretinal biopsy. A pars plana vitrectomy is a surgical procedure in which the vitreous humor is removed from the eye. A chorioretinal biopsy is a biopsy of the choroid, which is the layer of tissue that lies between the retina and the sclera. A chorioretinal biopsy can be used to diagnose the cause of the retinal detachment and to rule out other conditions, such as cancer.

Quantiferon and rapid plasma reagin tests and chest radiography are not necessary in this case. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with tuberculosis, and she does not have any risk factors for tuberculosis. Human leukocyte antigen genotyping is not necessary in this case. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with an autoimmune disease, and she does not have any risk factors for an autoimmune disease.

The patient is an 18-month-old girl with an unremarkable medical history who was referred to ocular oncology from pediatric ophthalmology for an intraocular mass near the optic nerve. Her parents noticed the left eye turning out for the past year. On examination, she fixed and followed with her right eye but not with the left, with 5.0-diopter exophoria at near in the left eye. Penlight examination results showed left leukocoria. Intraocular pressure and motility were normal bilaterally. On subsequent examination under anesthesia, the left optic nerve was obscured by a whitish mass. While the optic nerve itself was obscured, a pigmented crescent could be seen surrounding it. Ultrasonography results demonstrated an elevated retinal mass overlying an excavated optic nerve head. A small focus of hyperechogenicity was noted at the optic nerve head, consistent with calcium. Fluorescein angiography results demonstrated staining of the central whitish mass, which was obscuring the underlying retinal vessels. On fluorescein angiography results, no vessels were seen within the central whitish mass itself.

The differential diagnosis for a whitish mass obscuring the optic nerve includes retinoblastoma, astrocytoma, and hemangioma. Retinoblastoma is the most common intraocular malignancy in children, and it is usually diagnosed before the age of 2 years. Astrocytoma is a type of brain tumor that can spread to the eye, and it is most common in children under the age of 5 years. Hemangioma is a benign tumor of blood vessels, and it is most common in infants.

The next step in the management of this patient is to obtain an orbital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate for optic nerve invasion and a brain MRI to assess for a pineal gland tumor. If the MRIs are negative for tumor, then the patient can be observed with regular follow-up examinations. If the MRIs are positive for tumor, then the patient will need to undergo chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

Evaluation showed fixed swan neck deformities in multiple fingers. There was evidence of chronic synovial hypertrophy with no active synovitis on examination. The results of a comprehensive autoantibody blood panel, including antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, and anti-citrullinated peptide antibody, were unremarkable. Plain radiographs of the hands demonstrated diffuse osteopenia, joint space narrowing, and multiple deformities. Magnetic resonance imaging of both hands revealed multifocal osseous erosions, synovitis, and tenosynovitis.

The most likely diagnosis is nivolumab-induced inflammatory arthritis. This is a rare but well-recognized side effect of nivolumab, a monoclonal antibody that is used to treat cancer. The typical presentation is of an inflammatory arthritis that develops within a few months of starting treatment with nivolumab. The arthritis can affect any joint in the body, but it is most commonly seen in the hands, feet, and wrists. The symptoms of nivolumab-induced inflammatory arthritis can be severe, and they can include pain, swelling, and stiffness of the joints. In some cases, the arthritis can also cause erosions of the bone.

The diagnosis of nivolumab-induced inflammatory arthritis is based on a history of exposure to nivolumab, a typical clinical presentation, and the exclusion of other causes of arthritis. There is no specific treatment for nivolumab-induced inflammatory arthritis, but the symptoms can often be managed with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or corticosteroids. In some cases, it may be necessary to stop treatment with nivolumab.

The presence of raised soft tissue masses around the sternoclavicular joints and scapulae is concerning for a rheumatological disorder. The laboratory evaluation reveals normal results for complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and levels of electrolytes, creatinine, and C-reactive protein. A spot urinalysis showed a protein level of 220 mg/dL (reference range, <26 mg/dL), and a 24-hour urine collection revealed 1.8 g of albumin (reference range, <229 mg/24 h). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the shoulders and hips showed synovial and capsular thickening.

The next step in the evaluation is to order serum protein electrophoresis and serum free light chains assay. This test will help to determine if the patient has a monoclonal gammopathy, which is a type of protein that can be associated with a number of rheumatological disorders, including multiple myeloma.

The patient is a 57-year-old white man with obesity and hypertension. He presents for a primary care visit, during which he expresses concern about having diabetes. He reports no symptoms of hyperglycemia, such as frequent urination, increased thirst, fatigue, or visual changes, and had no known family history of diabetes. A series of blood tests had recently been obtained (Table). His body mass index (BMI) is 33.9 and his blood pressure is 160/90 mm Hg. The patient wants to know if a test could be done in the office to determine if he has diabetes.

The most appropriate next step is to perform a point-of-care (POC) hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) test via fingerstick to determine the patient’s glycemic status. A POC HbA1c test is a simple, accurate, and non-invasive test that can be performed in the office setting. It is a good screening test for diabetes and can be used to monitor glycemic control in patients with diabetes.

A laboratory-based glucose test is not necessary in this case, as the patient does not have any symptoms of hyperglycemia. A laboratory-based HbA1c test is also not necessary, as a POC HbA1c test is just as accurate and can be performed in the office setting.

It is not appropriate to do no testing, as the patient is concerned about having diabetes. The POC HbA1c test is a good way to screen for diabetes and monitor glycemic control in patients with diabetes.

The patient is a middle-aged man with a 12-year history of itchy eruptions over the whole body. Multiple nodules appeared on the upper back 1 year previously and gradually increased in number and size. The patient was otherwise healthy and denied a family history of inherited ichthyosis or atopy. Physical examination revealed extensive, dry scaly patches on the trunk, arms, and legs. Several 0.5- to 1-cm, dome-shaped, red papules and nodules were found on the upper back. Mildly enlarged lymph nodes were observed on the cervical, axillary, and inguinal regions. Results of routine blood tests, biochemistry analyses, and peripheral blood flow cytometry tests were within normal limits. No atypical cells were found in the peripheral blood. A biopsy specimen was obtained from the nodules on the patient’s back.

The clinical images show multiple dome-shaped nodules on the back (A) and extensive, dry scaly patches on the leg (B). Lesional histopathologic images show small to medium-sized atypical cells, and focal areas of epidermotropism (C, hematoxylin-eosin) and CD4 on immunohistochemical analysis (D) (original magnification ×200).

The most likely diagnosis is cutaneous pseudolymphoma. Cutaneous pseudolymphoma is a non-neoplastic skin condition that clinically and histologically resembles lymphoma. It is characterized by the presence of atypical lymphocytes in the skin, but these cells do not have the ability to spread to other parts of the body. Cutaneous pseudolymphoma is a common condition, affecting up to 1% of the population. It is more common in middle-aged and elderly people, and in women. The cause of cutaneous pseudolymphoma is unknown, but it is thought to be a reaction to an infection, inflammation, or other insult to the skin.

The clinical presentation of cutaneous pseudolymphoma varies depending on the subtype. The most common subtype is the papular variant, which presents with small, red papules on the skin. Other subtypes include the plaque variant, the nodular variant, and the tumor variant. The clinical presentation of cutaneous pseudolymphoma can be very similar to that of lymphoma, so it is important to make a definitive diagnosis with a biopsy.

The treatment of cutaneous pseudolymphoma depends on the subtype and the severity of the disease. The papular variant is often treated with topical steroids or calcineurin inhibitors. The plaque variant, the nodular variant, and the tumor variant may be treated with systemic corticosteroids, oral retinoids, or chemotherapy. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the lesions.

The prognosis for cutaneous pseudolymphoma is generally good. The condition is usually self-limited and resolves spontaneously within a few months to a year. However, some cases may be persistent or recurrent. In rare cases, cutaneous pseudolymphoma can progress to lymphoma.

The patient is a white woman in her 50s who underwent breast augmentation surgery with saline implants without postoperative complications. Five years later, she underwent a bilateral augmentation mammoplasty with removal and replacement of silicone gel implants and major mastopexy with capsulotomy. Although the patient’s surgical course was uncomplicated, several months postoperatively she noted persistent asymptomatic rough areas that she assumed were scars. Seven years after the second surgery, she was referred to dermatology for improvement of the areas for cosmetic reasons.

On physical examination, the patient had well-healed, barely identifiable scars on the inframammary creases and lower breast areas. Separate from the scars and located on the inferior medial bilateral breasts were 1- to 2-cm slightly erythematous annular atrophic plaques with more involvement of the left breast than the right. The rims of the lesions were raised with slight white scale and the centers slightly depressed and wrinkled in appearance.

The differential diagnosis for atrophic annular plaques on the breasts following augmentation surgery includes erythema annulare centrifugum, annular atrophic lichen planus, porokeratosis, and granuloma annulare. Erythema annulare centrifugum is a common, benign skin condition characterized by erythematous annular plaques with a raised, scaly border. Annular atrophic lichen planus is a chronic, inflammatory skin condition characterized by flat-topped, violaceous papules and plaques with a peripheral band of scale. Porokeratosis is a rare, chronic skin condition characterized by small, sharply demarcated, hyperkeratotic papules. Granuloma annulare is a common, benign skin condition characterized by small, firm, flesh-colored papules or plaques that often have a ring-like appearance.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is annular atrophic lichen planus. This is supported by the patient's history of atrophic annular plaques on the breasts following augmentation surgery, the clinical appearance of the lesions, and the lack of other systemic symptoms.

She traveled to Yosemite National Park in the weeks prior to onset but denied any particular infectious exposures or symptoms including rash. She reported no personal or family medical history. Although she did consume a variety of nutraceuticals, she denied medication and recreational drug use.

On examination, mental status, cranial nerves, and upper extremities were normal. Lower extremities were significant for her right side having greater pyramidal weakness than the left, with brisk reflexes and right ankle clonus, as well as a sensory level to pinprick at T6. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the total spine with and without gadolinium is seen in Figure 1. Initial investigations were notable for normal complete blood cell count, electrolytes, kidney and liver function, B12, and thyrotropin as well as an unremarkable MRI of the brain. Three lumbar punctures were performed over the course of the patient’s hospitalization, each with a white blood cell count less than 5 /µL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001), normal IgG index, absent oligoclonal bands, normal protein and glucose levels, and benign cytology. A comprehensive infectious and inflammatory workup including HIV, herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, Lyme disease, antinuclear antibodies, astrocyte aquaporin-4 autoantibody, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein autoantibody, and serum and cerebrospinal fluid autoimmune panels were negative. Whole-body positron emission tomography demonstrated hypermetabolism of the midthoracic cord.

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is a spinal dural arteriovenous fistula (SDAVF). SDAVFs are a rare cause of myelopathy, but they should be considered in patients with a history of progressive lower extremity weakness, sensory loss, and sphincter dysfunction, especially in the absence of other findings that would suggest an alternative diagnosis. The diagnosis of SDAVF is typically made with MRI of the spine, which can show characteristic findings of venous congestion and cord edema. Treatment of SDAVFs is typically with endovascular embolization, which can result in significant improvement in patient symptoms.

Examination reveals jugular venous distention, a diastolic sound at the left lower sternal border, and an enlarged, pulsatile liver. Electrocardiography shows resting abnormalities (rightward axis and inferolateral T-wave inversions). Posteroanterior chest radiography shows normal heart size and clear lungs. Transthoracic echocardiography shows normal left ventricular size and function without valvular abnormalities.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes right ventricular failure, constrictive pericarditis, and tricuspid regurgitation. Right ventricular failure can occur in a variety of settings, including pulmonary hypertension, left ventricular failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Constrictive pericarditis is a rare disease characterized by inflammation and thickening of the pericardium, which can lead to impaired diastolic filling of the heart. Tricuspid regurgitation is a condition in which the tricuspid valve does not close properly, allowing blood to flow back into the right atrium during systole.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to perform a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE). TEE is a more sensitive and specific test than transthoracic echocardiography for the diagnosis of right ventricular failure, constrictive pericarditis, and tricuspid regurgitation. In addition, TEE can be used to guide pericardiocentesis or balloon pericardiotomy in patients with constrictive pericarditis.

He has hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and obesity and is a current smoker. His medications include carvedilol, furosemide, lisinopril, metformin, and aspirin but no testosterone or herbal supplements. Family history is significant for a sister with brain cancer, diagnosed in her 40s. On physical examination, his vital signs are within normal limits; his body mass index, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared, is 53. His left nipple is retracted. At the 2-o’clock position of the left breast, 3 cm from the nipple, there was a 3.5 × 3.0–cm firm mass. The right breast was normal without masses, and there was no palpable axillary lymphadenopathy. He underwent a bilateral diagnostic mammogram, which showed a partially obscured mass in the left upper outer quadrant with linear extension to the nipple (Figure, left panel). Targeted ultrasound showed a 2.0 × 1.6 × 1.6–cm irregular hypoechoic mass (Figure, right panel).

The differential diagnosis for a breast mass in a man includes carcinoma, gynecomastia, lipoma, and hematoma. The most common cause of a breast mass in a man is gynecomastia, which is benign enlargement of the male breast. Gynecomastia can be caused by a number of factors, including hormonal imbalance, medications, and certain medical conditions.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to perform a percutaneous biopsy of the mass. This will allow for a definitive diagnosis and treatment plan. If the biopsy shows that the mass is malignant, the patient will need to undergo surgery to remove the mass and surrounding tissue. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy may also be recommended.

If the biopsy shows that the mass is benign, the patient may be monitored with serial imaging studies. In some cases, a surgical biopsy may be recommended to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out malignancy.

The patient has a history of severe dysphagia and dysphonia, with fever and rhinorrhea in the few days preceding the emergency consultation. He has several macules and desquamatory lesions on the mucosa of the oral cavity, lips, and penis, and hemorrhage lesions of the eye sclera. The skin of the patient is unremarkable. The nasofibroscopy results showed generalized desquamatory lesions of the upper aerodigestive tract mucosa affecting the laryngeal and vocal fold mucosa. There is no dyspnea and the airway is clear. The patient revealed that he had a similar but less severe clinical event 5 years previously. At that time, no diagnosis was found and the lesions disappeared following treatment with corticosteroids. Dermatopathologic analysis, biology, serology, and biopsy were performed.

The most likely diagnosis is Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS). SJS is a rare but serious skin and mucous membrane disorder that can cause life-threatening complications. It is characterized by fever, skin rash, and mucosal lesions. The skin rash typically begins as small red spots that quickly turn into blisters. The blisters may then break and ooze fluid, leaving behind raw, painful areas of skin. The mucosal lesions can affect the mouth, eyes, nose, throat, and genitals.

SJS is thought to be an autoimmune disorder, meaning that the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissues. The exact cause of SJS is unknown, but it is often triggered by an infection, medication, or certain types of cancer.

There is no cure for SJS, but treatment can help to relieve symptoms and prevent complications. Treatment may include corticosteroids, antibiotics, and supportive care. In severe cases, a patient may need to be hospitalized.

The prognosis for SJS varies depending on the severity of the illness. Most people recover completely, but some may have long-term problems, such as scarring or vision loss.

The patient is a healthy Asian man in his 20s with a 5-month history of progressive bilateral nasal obstruction and recurrent epistaxis. On physical examination, nasopharyngoscopy showed a pedunculated mass with a smooth mucosal surface arising from the roof of the nasopharynx. Computed tomographic (CT) imaging revealed a midline, well-defined, pedunculated polypoid lesion with areas of calcifications in the nasopharynx, measuring approximately 1.2 × 1.5 × 2.0 cm. An endoscopic resection via retrovelar approach using a 70-degree endoscope combined with transnasal approach was performed under general anesthesia. The mass was completely resected with its stalk and with adequate surgical margin. Histopathological results showed that the tumor cells were arranged in papillary structures with fibrovascular cores and these cells also had nuclear grooves. Results of other investigations after surgery were negative for cancer, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the neck and thyroid ultrasonography. In addition, no residual tumor or systemic metastasis was observed on positron emission tomography (PET)-CT results. There was no evidence of recurrence at 12-month postoperative follow-up.

The most likely diagnosis is papillary adenocarcinoma of the nasopharynx. This is supported by the following findings:

* The patient is a healthy Asian man in his 20s, which is the typical age group for papillary adenocarcinoma of the nasopharynx.
* The patient presents with progressive bilateral nasal obstruction and recurrent epistaxis, which are common symptoms of papillary adenocarcinoma of the nasopharynx.
* CT imaging shows a midline, well-defined, pedunculated polypoid lesion with areas of calcifications in the nasopharynx, which is the typical appearance of papillary adenocarcinoma of the nasopharynx.
* Histopathological results show that the tumor cells are arranged in papillary structures with fibrovascular cores and these cells also have nuclear grooves, which are characteristic features of papillary adenocarcinoma of the nasopharynx.
* Results of other investigations after surgery were negative for cancer, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the neck and thyroid ultrasonography, which suggest that the tumor is localized to the nasopharynx.
* No residual tumor or systemic metastasis was observed on positron emission tomography (PET)-CT results, which suggests that the tumor is low-grade and has a good prognosis.

The lesions initially only involved his lips and nasal bridge, and appeared 5 months prior while he was living on a ranch in Mexico. The lesions did not respond to treatment with an unknown oral antibiotic. His medical history included hypertension treated with captopril and a remote history of psoriasis. Physical examination demonstrated several dry, crusted skin lesions with blistering and ulceration, and shallow erythematous ulcerations of his oral mucosa. Internal medicine, otolaryngology, and dermatology departments were consulted. Results of flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy demonstrated erythematous and ulcerative lesions with surrounding leukoplakia involving the base of tongue, glossoepiglottic fold, lingual and laryngeal surfaces of the epiglottis, and aryepiglottic folds. A QuantiFERON-TB Gold test was obtained, and results were found to be positive. Serum antigen testing for blastomyces, histoplasmosis, syphilis, HIV, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, human herpesvirus 6, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, varicella zoster virus, human polyomavirus 2, and West Nile virus were performed, and all results were found to be negative. A biopsy of the skin lesion was obtained from the edge of the lesion found on the patient’s back. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay serological testing was subsequently performed, and results demonstrated elevated levels of antidesmoglein 1 immunoglobulin G (IgG) and antidesmoglein 3 IgG.

Based on the above information, the most likely diagnosis is pemphigus vulgaris. Pemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune disease that causes the body's immune system to attack the proteins that hold the skin cells together. This results in the formation of blisters and ulcers on the skin and mucous membranes. Pemphigus vulgaris is most common in adults over the age of 60, and it is more common in women than men. The exact cause of pemphigus vulgaris is unknown, but it is thought to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

The symptoms of pemphigus vulgaris typically begin with a rash of small, red blisters on the skin. The blisters may be filled with clear fluid or blood, and they may be painful or itchy. The blisters often burst and form ulcers, which can be very painful. The ulcers may also become infected. Pemphigus vulgaris can also affect the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, throat, and eyes. The symptoms of pemphigus vulgaris can vary from person to person. Some people may only have a few blisters, while others may have widespread lesions. The severity of the symptoms can also vary. Some people may have mild symptoms that resolve on their own, while others may have severe symptoms that require hospitalization.

There is no cure for pemphigus vulgaris, but there are treatments that can help to control the symptoms. Treatment typically involves a combination of medications, including corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs, and antibiotics. The goal of treatment is to suppress the immune system and allow the skin to heal. Treatment for pemphigus vulgaris can be expensive and have serious side effects. It is important to work with a doctor to find the best treatment plan for you.

She has no associated fevers, chills, dryness of mouth, nausea, vomiting, dysphagia or odynophagia. Her medical history is unremarkable except for allergic rhinitis. On physical examination, she has slight enlargement of the left submandibular gland, which is not tender on palpation. Ultrasonography results revealed normal submandibular and parotid glands bilaterally without any mass or calcifications. Blood examinations and basic metabolic panel results were all within normal limits. Sialoendoscopy of the left submandibular duct was performed under general anesthesia. The patient was found to have a cast at the opening of the Wharton duct, which was removed and sent for pathological evaluation. Using sialoendoscopy with saline irrigation, the entire duct was examined up to the hilum of the gland. No stones were noted. There were areas of mild partial webbing without complete obstruction. The areas of webbing were broken up with irrigation, and at the end of the procedure steroid instillation and irrigation were performed. There were no complications during or after the procedure. Hematoxylin-eosin–stained histological slide of the cast showing numerous eosinophils.

The most likely diagnosis is eosinophilic sialodochitis. Eosinophilic sialodochitis is a rare inflammatory condition of the salivary glands that is characterized by the presence of eosinophils in the salivary ducts. It is most commonly seen in middle-aged women. The exact cause of eosinophilic sialodochitis is unknown, but it is thought to be an immune-mediated condition. The symptoms of eosinophilic sialodochitis include pain, swelling, and tenderness of the salivary glands.

She had undergone an uncomplicated Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) for Fuchs endothelial dystrophy in the right eye 5 months before. The patient was admitted on that day and commenced taking topical cefuroxime, 5%, and gentamicin, 1.5%, drops every hour around the clock, and topical steroid was discontinued. One day later, there was no improvement in the graft-host interface haze, and results of microbiological investigations, including donor rim culture, were all negative. In view of the clinical dilemma, an in vivo confocal microscopy was performed to aid the diagnosis.

The in vivo confocal microscopy showed diffuse hyperreflective crisscross changes at the graft-host interface. This finding is consistent with a diagnosis of graft rejection. Graft rejection is a serious complication of DSAEK that can lead to graft failure. The treatment of graft rejection is controversial, but there is general agreement that early diagnosis and treatment are essential.

In this case, the patient has had no improvement in her graft-host interface haze despite treatment with topical antibiotics. The results of microbiological investigations are negative, which suggests that the graft rejection is not caused by an infection. The in vivo confocal microscopy shows diffuse hyperreflective crisscross changes at the graft-host interface, which is a characteristic finding of graft rejection.

The most appropriate management in this case is to bring the patient to the operating room urgently and remove and send the DSAEK graft for microbiological culture and sensitivity. The graft should then be replaced with a new graft. This is the most effective treatment for graft rejection and is the only way to prevent graft failure.

The patient's gonioscopic examination showed no angle structures in either eye. Results of an undilated fundus examination was unremarkable. The patient's ultrasonographic images show no masses and shallow choroidal effusion.

Answer: The correct answer is A. Perform peripheral iridotomy.

The patient's presentation is consistent with acute angle-closure glaucoma, which is a medical emergency. The treatment of acute angle-closure glaucoma is to lower the intraocular pressure. This can be done with medications, such as timolol or pilocarpine, or with a peripheral iridotomy. A peripheral iridotomy is a procedure that creates a small opening in the iris, which allows aqueous humor to flow out of the eye and lower the intraocular pressure. The patient's best-corrected visual acuity is 20/25 OU, which is good, but his visual acuity is 20/400 OU while wearing prescription lenses, which is poor. This suggests that the patient's visual acuity is likely to improve with treatment.

The patient has a history of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. He is currently undergoing treatment with nivolumab, a checkpoint inhibitor. Five weeks after the first dose of nivolumab, he developed diplopia and myalgia that mostly affected proximal muscle groups. Physical examination revealed ptosis, modest restriction of ocular motility in all directions bilaterally, and esotropia with left hypertropia in the primary gaze. Muscle strength was 5/5 on hip flexion and extension bilaterally. There was no weakness with repetitive and sustained testing of power. Workup revealed elevated creatine kinase, aldolase, and C-reactive protein levels. Acetylcholine receptor binding and modulating antibody levels were elevated. Results of the striated muscle antibody titer were also abnormal. Blood test results were negative for acetylcholine receptor blocking and muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase antibodies. Nerve conduction studies showed a normal response to repetitive nerve stimulation. Single-fiber electromyography was pathologic and revealed an abnormal mean consecutive difference in more than 50% of the tested pairs. Myopathic action potentials were not present. A chest computed tomographic scan ruled out the presence of a thymoma.

The most likely diagnosis is myasthenia gravis, a disorder characterized by weakness of voluntary muscles caused by the autoimmune destruction of acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. The clinical features of myasthenia gravis are consistent with the patient's presentation, including diplopia, ptosis, and weakness of proximal muscle groups. The elevated levels of acetylcholine receptor binding and modulating antibodies are also consistent with myasthenia gravis. The normal response to repetitive nerve stimulation on nerve conduction studies suggests that the weakness is not due to a peripheral neuropathy. The abnormal mean consecutive difference on single-fiber electromyography is a characteristic finding in myasthenia gravis. The absence of myopathic action potentials on electromyography suggests that the weakness is not due to a myopathy. The chest computed tomographic scan that ruled out the presence of a thymoma is also supportive of the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis.

The patient's history of metastatic breast cancer and recent development of rapidly progressive vision loss in both eyes is concerning for cancer-related choroidal metastasis. Choroidal metastasis is a common complication of metastatic breast cancer, and it can present with a variety of symptoms, including vision loss, floaters, and eye pain. The diagnosis of choroidal metastasis is made with ophthalmoscopy, which can reveal the characteristic appearance of placoid yellow choroidal lesions with ill-defined borders and subretinal fluid.

The treatment of choroidal metastasis is typically with systemic chemotherapy, but there is no proven benefit of intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections. In fact, some studies have suggested that intravitreal VEGF inhibitors may actually worsen the progression of choroidal metastasis. Therefore, the best course of management for this patient is to obtain a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and orbits to confirm the diagnosis of choroidal metastasis and to assess the extent of disease. Once the extent of disease has been determined, the patient can be started on systemic chemotherapy.

The patient has multiple growing papules superimposed on an asymptomatic firm plaque on the occipital scalp. The lesions were never ulcerated or inflamed, but hemorrhage occurred occasionally after rubbing. At 3 years of age, scarlike macules appeared on the occipital scalp and coalesced to form a larger plaque with sparse hair. Simultaneously, multiple brown-red, dome-shaped papules developed on the nose and gradually evolved to involve the cheeks. Rubbery plaques also developed on the sacrococcygeal area, along with hypopigmented patches on the right buttock. The patient has no systemic symptoms or mental impairment and denied a family history of genetic disease.

Physical examination revealed a group of unevenly distributed skin–colored-to-pink, discrete, coalescing papules superimposed on a firm plaque on the occipital scalp. A biopsy specimen was obtained from one of these papules. Another biopsy from a facial papule demonstrated features of angiofibroma.

The biopsy specimen from the occipital papule showed diffuse dense fibrosis, capillary vessel proliferation with some ectasia, and perifollicular fibroblastic proliferation. These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of sclerotic neurofibroma.

Sclerotic neurofibroma is a rare subtype of neurofibroma that is characterized by dense fibrosis and a lack of Schwann cells. It is typically seen in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). The lesions are usually asymptomatic, but they can cause cosmetic problems or pain. Treatment is not usually necessary, but surgical removal may be considered in some cases.

The other answer choices are incorrect. Familial cutaneous collagenoma is a rare genetic disorder characterized by multiple collagenomas, which are benign tumors of the skin. Shagreen patch is a skin lesion that is seen in patients with tuberous sclerosis complex. Fibrous cephalic plaque is a benign skin lesion that is seen in children.

They exhibit the buttonhole sign on palpation, which is a characteristic finding of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP). DFSP is a rare, locally aggressive cutaneous sarcoma that typically presents as a solitary, raised, dome-shaped nodule. However, it can also present as a multicentric disease, as in this case. The histopathology of DFSP shows a poorly circumscribed hypercellular proliferation of spindle cells occupying the lower reticular dermis with lacelike infiltration of the subcutaneous fat. The spindle cells are somewhat whorled and uniform in appearance, with mildly hyperchromatic, elongated, wavy nuclei surrounded by pale cytoplasm.

Reasoning:

* The patient presents with a 2-month history of persistent muscle twitching in his abdomen and bilateral calves during wakefulness and sleep accompanied with excessive sweating, as well as mild bilateral lower extremity weakness after prolonged walking. These symptoms are consistent with autoimmune Isaacs syndrome, a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by muscle cramps, fasciculations, and myokymia.
* The patient also has psoriasis, which is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by red, scaly skin patches. Psoriasis is a known risk factor for autoimmune Isaacs syndrome.
* The patient's examination results are significant for psoriatic skin lesions and purple stria in the abdomen and both calves. Purple stria are a characteristic finding in autoimmune Isaacs syndrome.
* The patient's laboratory test results are normal, which helps to rule out other possible causes of his symptoms, such as electrolyte imbalance, thyroid disease, and paraneoplastic syndromes.
* The patient's chest computed tomography results are normal, which helps to rule out other possible causes of his symptoms, such as a tumor or infection.

The patient is a 30-year-old man with a history of facial trauma who presents with an incidental 7-mm tissue density within the posterior aspect of the left sphenoid sinus. The lesion is T1 dark, T2 bright, and multilobulated, with heterogeneous enhancement on postcontrast imaging. Pathological analysis reveals sheets of neoplastic, vacuolated, "soap bubble–like" cells with a myxoid background.

The differential diagnosis for a sphenoid sinus mass includes a variety of benign and malignant neoplasms. Benign neoplasms include chondroma, chordoma, and ectchordosis physalsiphora. Malignant neoplasms include chondrosarcoma, osteosarcoma, and carcinoma.

The patient's age and history of facial trauma are not helpful in narrowing the differential diagnosis. The CT scan findings are suggestive of a benign neoplasm, but the MRI findings are more concerning for a malignant neoplasm. The pathological findings are diagnostic of ectchordosis physalsiphora.

Ecchordosis physalsiphora is a rare, benign neoplasm that arises from the meninges. It is most commonly found in the clivus and sphenoid sinus. The neoplasm is composed of vacuolated cells with a myxoid stroma. It is often associated with neurofibromatosis type 2.

The patient is a 29-year-old woman with a 2-month history of left-sided epiphora, headache, and facial pressure. A polypoid lesion was identified at the left lateral nasal wall. Noncontrasted computed tomography showed a hyperdense mass involving the left medial canthus extending through the nasolacrimal duct into the left nasal cavity. The patient underwent endoscopic left maxillary antrostomy, ethmoidectomy, and biopsy of mass, with results of pathology analysis showing poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was positive for cytokeratin 5/6 and p63, and negative for Epstein-Barr virus, p16, CD45 (leukocyte common antigen), and synaptophysin. The patient was referred to a tertiary care facility for further treatment. On examination, there was a palpable subcutaneous nodule 1 cm inferior to the left medial canthus with normal overlying skin. On nasal endoscopy, residual tumor was visible at the anterior aspect of the lateral nasal wall. Computed tomography showed postoperative changes with enhancement of left medial canthus extending into nasolacrimal duct and along the lateral nasal sidewall.

The differential diagnosis for a unilateral nasal mass in a woman in her 20s includes a variety of benign and malignant neoplasms. The most common benign neoplasms are nasal polyps, which are typically inflammatory in nature and do not require treatment. Other benign neoplasms include papillomas, hemangiomas, and lymphangiomas. Malignant neoplasms that can occur in the nose include squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and sarcoma.

Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common malignant neoplasm of the nose. It is typically seen in older adults, but can occur in younger patients, as in this case. The tumor is often poorly differentiated and can spread to regional lymph nodes and other parts of the body. Treatment typically involves surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

Adenocarcinoma is a less common malignant neoplasm of the nose. It is typically seen in middle-aged and older adults. The tumor can arise from the lining of the nasal cavity or sinuses. It is often poorly differentiated and can spread to regional lymph nodes and other parts of the body. Treatment typically involves surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

Sarcoma is a rare malignant neoplasm of the nose. It can arise from bone, cartilage, or muscle. It is typically seen in children and young adults. The tumor is often aggressive and can spread to regional lymph nodes and other parts of the body. Treatment typically involves surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

In this case, the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging studies are consistent with a diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma. The patient's age, gender, and presentation are also consistent with this diagnosis. The biopsy results show poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The IHC staining is positive for cytokeratin 5/6 and p63, and negative for Epstein-Barr virus, p16, CD45 (leukocyte common antigen), and synaptophysin. This further supports the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma.

Autoimmune disorders can cause inflammation and swelling of the tissues, which can lead to the formation of masses. The patient's MRI results show bilateral intraconal soft tissue masses with avid enhancement on postcontrast images. This suggests that the masses are vascular and may be caused by an autoimmune disorder.

Answer: A. Obtain thyroid function test results or obtain endocrine evaluation results.

Thyroid function tests can help to determine if the patient has an autoimmune disorder of the thyroid gland. Endocrine evaluation can help to determine if the patient has other autoimmune disorders, such as Graves' disease or Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

The other options are not as likely to be helpful in diagnosing the patient's condition. Chest computed tomography can help to rule out other causes of the patient's symptoms, such as cancer or infection. However, it is not as likely to be helpful in diagnosing an autoimmune disorder. Biopsy results can help to confirm the diagnosis of an autoimmune disorder, but they are not necessary in the initial evaluation of the patient.

The patient is a 5-year-old boy with a history of an Escherichia coli infection complicated by hemolytic uremic syndrome who presented with a visual acuity of 20/125 OD and 20/20 OS (HOTV letters). He had no history of hearing loss or pigmented skin lesions. He had no past ocular history or prior ophthalmic examinations. Color vision was severely diminished in the right eye, as determined by Ishihara color plates, and he had no detectable stereoacuity, as determined by Titmus testing. Intraocular pressure and extraocular movements were normal. He had a mild relative afferent pupillary defect in the right eye but no strabismus or nystagmus. The cycloplegic refraction was +2.50 + 0.50 × 100 OD and +2.00 sphere OS. Results of an anterior segment slitlamp biomicroscopy examination showed no abnormalities. Results of a dilated retinal examination showed a large, elevated, homogenous, gray mass in the macula of the right eye with temporal pallor of the optic disc (Figure, A). Optical coherence tomography demonstrated gliosis with a tractional epiretinal membrane and modest disorganization of the retinal layers, producing a sawtooth configuration within the outer plexiform layer (Figure, B).

The most likely diagnosis is Coats disease, a rare, non-inflammatory, bilateral retinal vasculopathy that typically affects children. The disease is characterized by the accumulation of abnormal blood vessels in the retina, which can lead to retinal detachment and blindness. The exact cause of Coats disease is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

There is no cure for Coats disease, but treatment can help to slow the progression of the disease and improve vision. Treatment options include laser therapy, cryotherapy, and surgery.

In this case, the patient is a young boy with a history of hemolytic uremic syndrome, a condition that is associated with an increased risk of developing Coats disease. The patient's visual acuity is significantly decreased in the right eye, and he has evidence of retinal detachment. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of Coats disease.

The next step in the management of this patient is to refer him to a pediatric ophthalmologist for further evaluation and treatment. The ophthalmologist will likely recommend laser therapy or cryotherapy to destroy the abnormal blood vessels in the retina.

The patient is a 24-year-old man with type 1 diabetes who presents with substantial loss of visual acuity in the left eye. He has had diabetes for 5 years and has never been examined for diabetic retinopathy. His hemoglobin A1c level is 11.0%, suggesting a lack of compliance with his diabetic treatment regimen. His best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) is 20/100 OS and 20/60 OD. On examination of the left eye, there is considerable retinal thickening, substantial capillary nonperfusion in the macular area, and a large area of disc neovascularization (in more than one-third of the disc area), with leakage on the disc associated with prepapillary neovascularization, as confirmed by fluorescein angiography. Optical coherence tomography confirmed retinal thickening in the macular area (central subfield thickness [CST], 805 μm), with cystoid abnormalities throughout the retinal layers as well as subretinal fluid.

The patient's presentation is consistent with diabetic retinopathy, a leading cause of blindness in the developed world. Diabetic retinopathy is caused by damage to the blood vessels in the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. This damage can lead to a number of complications, including vision loss.

The treatment for diabetic retinopathy depends on the stage of the disease. In the early stages of the disease, laser therapy may be used to seal off abnormal blood vessels. In more advanced stages of the disease, surgery may be necessary to remove scar tissue or to repair the retina.

In this case, the patient has severe diabetic retinopathy with neovascularization of the disc. Neovascularization of the disc is a serious complication of diabetic retinopathy that can lead to blindness. The treatment for neovascularization of the disc is laser therapy and intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections.

Laser therapy is a procedure in which a laser is used to destroy abnormal blood vessels in the retina. This can help to prevent further damage to the retina and to improve vision. Intravitreal anti-VEGF injections are a treatment in which a medication is injected into the vitreous humor, the clear gel that fills the inside of the eye. This medication helps to block the growth of new blood vessels and to reduce inflammation.

The combination of laser therapy and intravitreal anti-VEGF injections is the most effective treatment for neovascularization of the disc. In this case, the patient should be treated with both laser therapy and intravitreal anti-VEGF injections.

At the moment of impact, she was wearing her seat belt, the airbag deployed, and an intense flexion-extension head movement occurred. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/125 OD and 20/63 OS. Intraocular pressure was 19 mm Hg OD and 20 mm Hg OS. Slitlamp examination revealed no palpebral hematoma, and the anterior segment was found to be normal. On the fundus bilaterally, we only noted an alteration of the foveal reflection, with neither retinae commotio nor hemorrhages. Macular optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed bilateral macular edema with cystoid abnormalities (Figure 1). An epiretinal membrane also was noted in the left eye (Figure 1B). Optical coherence tomography showed bilateral macular edema with cystoid abnormalities. Central subfield thickness was 696 μm in the right eye and 392 μm in the left eye.

The most likely diagnosis is traumatic optic neuropathy (TON). TON is a condition that occurs when the optic nerve is damaged due to blunt trauma to the head. The symptoms of TON include blurred vision, decreased visual acuity, and color vision defects. The diagnosis of TON is made based on the history and physical examination. Imaging studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scan, may be helpful in ruling out other causes of visual loss.

The treatment of TON is controversial. Some experts recommend systemic corticosteroids, while others recommend local corticosteroid injections into the optic nerve sheath. Epiretinal membrane peeling may be considered for patients with persistent visual loss despite medical therapy.

In this case, the patient should be started on systemic corticosteroids. The goal of treatment is to reduce inflammation and edema of the optic nerve. The patient should also be monitored for signs of increased intracranial pressure, such as headache, nausea, and vomiting. If the patient does not improve with medical therapy, epiretinal membrane peeling may be considered.

The histopathological findings show a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with atypia and occasional Pautrier microabscesses. The immunohistochemical findings show positive staining for CD3 and CD4. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of mycosis fungoides.

Mycosis fungoides is a rare, chronic, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that typically presents with patches or plaques of skin that are often pruritic. The lesions may be hypopigmented, hyperpigmented, or atrophic. The disease can progress to involve the lymph nodes, skin, and internal organs.

The treatment of mycosis fungoides depends on the stage of the disease. Early-stage disease is often treated with topical corticosteroids or phototherapy. More advanced disease may require systemic chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

There was no warmth, thrills, or pulsations across the affected area. The patient complained about a mild tingling sensation within the lesion. The patient could not think of any triggers or causes for his condition and denied any aggravating or alleviating factors as well as any treatment attempts. Complete review of systems yielded negative results except for easy bruising. He was taking finasteride, montelukast, enalapril, and metoprolol. His medical history was significant for right total reverse shoulder replacement 5 years prior. Apart from the previously described lesion, his physical examination was unremarkable, and he had full range of motion of his right shoulder. A punch biopsy of the slightly indurated papule from the involved area on the right biceps was completed.

The histopathologic findings of the biopsy show a dermal infiltrate arranged in nodules with clefting between nodules; some inflammatory aggregates are also seen within dilated vessels. Immunohistochemical staining for CD68 antigen reveals that the infiltrate is composed mostly of histiocytes.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of intralymphatic histiocytosis (ILH). ILH is a rare, non-Langerhans cell histiocytic disorder characterized by the accumulation of histiocytes within lymphatic vessels. The most common presentation of ILH is a single, linear, or patchy plaque on the extremities. The lesions are often violaceous or brown in color and may be associated with mild pruritus or tenderness. Histologically, ILH is characterized by the accumulation of histiocytes within lymphatic vessels. The histiocytes are typically CD68-positive and negative for S-100 protein.

The treatment of ILH is generally not necessary, as the lesions are usually self-limited. However, in some cases, treatment with systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents may be necessary.

The patient is a white man in his early 40s with a medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (Rai stage 0) who reported a 6-month history of a growing mass in his right axilla and weight loss. Physical examination revealed palpable right axillary lymphadenopathy. The patient was an active smoker (1 pack per day) with an unremarkable family history. A positron emission tomography scan showed a hypermetabolic right axillary lymph node that measured 5 × 5 cm as well as multiple liver lesions, the largest of which measured 8 cm. The results of a core needle biopsy specimen from the right axillary lymph node were consistent with malignant neoplasm, with immunohistochemistry staining positive for S100, HMB-45, and MART-1. He began pembrolizumab therapy. After starting treatment, the patient began to notice slowly worsening painless, nonpruritic, diffuse dark gray skin, nail beds, and eye discoloration. The results of laboratory studies revealed normal electrolytes, normal kidney function, mild elevation of liver function, and mild anemia with a hemoglobin level of 12 g/dL. Computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis showed worsening hepatic metastases and right axillary adenopathy.

The most likely diagnosis is Addison disease. Addison disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes the adrenal glands to produce too little cortisol and aldosterone. Symptoms of Addison disease can include fatigue, weakness, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, muscle cramps, and joint pain. The skin may become hyperpigmented, especially in areas exposed to the sun. Addison disease can be life-threatening if not treated.

The other possible diagnoses are not as likely. Hemochromatosis is a genetic disorder that causes the body to absorb too much iron. Symptoms of hemochromatosis can include fatigue, weakness, joint pain, and abdominal pain. The skin may become bronzed, but this is not a common symptom. Hemochromatosis is not life-threatening if treated.

Diffuse melanosis cutis is a rare condition that causes the skin to become darker. Symptoms of diffuse melanosis cutis can include a generalized darkening of the skin, especially in areas exposed to the sun. Diffuse melanosis cutis is not life-threatening.

Hyperpigmentation due to sun exposure is a common condition that causes the skin to become darker. Symptoms of hyperpigmentation due to sun exposure can include a tan or a sunburn. Hyperpigmentation due to sun exposure is not life-threatening.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Addison disease.

The patient is a 44-year-old woman with dilated cardiomyopathy who underwent an uneventful implant of a subcutaneous cardioverter defibrillator (S-ICD) for secondary prevention. Two weeks later, she presents to the emergency department (ED) after receiving several shocks from the device during the early morning, waking her up from sleeping. There were no reported symptoms associated with shortness of breath, chest pain, or syncope. Physical examination results revealed no signs of decompensated heart failure. Device interrogation results showed shock therapies delivered postimplant on days 3, 5, 6, and 10. The surface electrogram from the events, recorded at a paper speed of 25 millimeters per second and an amplitude of 2.5 mm/mV, is shown in Figure 1. Repeated chest radiography at the ED showed appropriate device location, lead pin, and an absence of subcutaneous air trapping at the proximal and distal sense electrodes.

The most likely cause of the patient's shocks is ventricular tachycardia (VT). VT is a rapid heart rate that originates in the ventricles, the lower chambers of the heart. VT can be life-threatening if it is not treated. The first step in treating VT is to identify the underlying cause. In this case, the patient has dilated cardiomyopathy, which is a condition that causes the heart muscle to weaken and stretch. Dilated cardiomyopathy can lead to VT and other arrhythmias.

Once the underlying cause of VT has been identified, the next step is to treat the arrhythmia. There are a number of different ways to treat VT, including medication, catheter ablation, and implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) therapy. In this case, the patient has already undergone an S-ICD implant. An S-ICD is a device that is implanted under the skin in the chest. The device monitors the heart rhythm and delivers a shock if it detects VT or ventricular fibrillation.

The patient's shocks are likely due to a problem with the S-ICD. The S-ICD may be sensing VT that is not actually occurring, or the device may be delivering shocks that are too high. In order to determine the cause of the patient's shocks, it is necessary to interrogate the S-ICD and review the surface electrogram from the events.

If the S-ICD is functioning properly, the next step is to treat the underlying cause of VT. In this case, the patient has dilated cardiomyopathy. Dilated cardiomyopathy is a chronic condition, and there is no cure. However, there are a number of medications that can be used to manage the condition and prevent VT. These medications include beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and antiarrhythmic drugs.

In some cases, catheter ablation may be necessary to treat VT. Catheter ablation is a procedure that uses radiofrequency energy to destroy the areas of the heart that are causing the arrhythmia. Catheter ablation is a very effective treatment for VT, and it can be curative in some cases.

In some cases, an ICD may be necessary to treat VT. An ICD is a device that is implanted under the skin in the chest. The device monitors the heart rhythm and delivers a shock if it detects VT or ventricular fibrillation. An ICD can be life-saving, and it is often recommended for patients who have a high risk of sudden cardiac death.

In conclusion, the patient's shocks are likely due to a problem with the S-ICD. The S-ICD may be sensing VT that is not actually occurring, or the device may be delivering shocks that are too high. In order to determine the cause of the patient's shocks, it is necessary to interrogate the S-ICD and review the surface electrogram from the events.

The patient is a young woman with a 1-year history of a right tongue mass that developed after initial bite trauma. The lesion waxed and waned but never completely healed; however, it greatly increased in size over 3 weeks before presentation. She reported constant, severe stabbing pain, right otalgia, and occasional swelling that caused oral dysphagia. She reported no constitutional symptoms or any history of tobacco or alcohol use. On examination, the mass was a 3 × 2-cm, exophytic and raised, plateaulike lesion on the right dorsolateral tongue with approximately 1 to 2 cm of surrounding induration. A biopsy was obtained that demonstrated ulceration, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, and abundant acute and chronic inflammation replete with eosinophils. The differential based on the biopsy included traumatic ulcerative granuloma with stromal eosinophilia and ulceration due to drug- or infection-related sources. In addition, the possibility of an unsampled submucosal mass with overlying ulceration was suggested by the pathologist who interpreted the biopsy findings. Given our clinical concern for an unsampled neoplasm, the patient subsequently underwent resection of the mass; histologic sections of the specimen are demonstrated in Figure, B. Immunohistochemistry studies for SOX-10 revealed positive staining in the proliferating spindle-shaped cells.

The most likely diagnosis is **schwannoma with a traumatic ulcerative granuloma with stromal eosinophilialike reaction**. This is a rare condition that is characterized by a combination of a schwannoma (a benign tumor of Schwann cells) and a traumatic ulcerative granuloma (a type of inflammatory reaction). The presence of eosinophils in the granuloma is a characteristic feature of this condition.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely. Human papillomavirus–related squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that is caused by the human papillomavirus. It is more common in older people and is typically associated with a history of tobacco or alcohol use. Ulcerated plexiform neurofibroma is a type of nerve tumor that is associated with neurofibromatosis type 1. Ulcerated granular cell tumor is a rare type of tumor that is typically found in the skin.

The patient is a 45-year-old man with HIV infection and a history of hepatic tuberculosis. He has been receiving HAART and has achieved full virological suppression, but his CD4 counts remain low. He has recently completed 12 months of directly observed therapy for tuberculosis. He presents with dysphagia, nasal regurgitation, nonproductive cough, breathy voice, and a 25-pound weight loss over the preceding 2 months. Physical examination reveals evidence of perforation of the hard palate. A computed tomographic scan of the chest reveals necrotic lymph nodes, and a palatine biopsy is performed.

The most likely diagnosis is tuberculosis of the palate. This is supported by the patient's history of HIV infection and hepatic tuberculosis, his low CD4 counts, and the presence of necrotic lymph nodes on computed tomographic scan. The perforation of the hard palate is a characteristic finding of tuberculosis of the palate.

Tertiary syphilis is a less likely diagnosis. This is because the patient has not had any symptoms of syphilis in the past, and he does not have any of the characteristic skin lesions of tertiary syphilis.

Histoplasmosis is a less likely diagnosis. This is because the patient does not have any of the characteristic symptoms of histoplasmosis, such as fever, cough, and weight loss.

The choroidal mass is a potential cause of vision loss, and the subluxed lens can cause glare and blurred vision. The patient also has a history of congestive heart failure, which could make surgery more risky. Therefore, the next step in management is to obtain a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits to determine the size, location, and extent of the choroidal mass. This information will help to determine the best course of treatment, which may include plaque radiotherapy, pars plana lensectomy to remove the subluxed lens, or biopsy of the choroidal mass.

She is currently on immunosuppression with tacrolimus and mycophenolate. She presented with frequent falls, right-sided lower-extremity weakness, intermittent confusion, left eye pain, slurred speech, expressive aphasia, partial left abducens nerve palsy, decreased motor strength in her right upper and lower extremities, and right-sided pronator drift. Laboratory evaluation showed a white blood cell count of 9.6 K/μL and a lactic acid dehydrogenase level of 547 U/L. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed a white blood cell count of 51 cells/μL with 92% lymphocytes, a glucose level of 76 mg/dL, and a protein level of 136 mg/dL. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain showed multifocal vasogenic edema around the left lentiform nuclei, left temporal occipital white matter, and right parietal white matter, with mass effect causing near complete effacement of the third ventricle and subsequent rightward midline shift. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed multiple ring-enhancing lesions. A fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/CT demonstrated increased focal fluorodeoxyglucose activity throughout the brain only. The patient underwent a biopsy of the right posterior temporal lobe, which showed a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.

The most likely diagnosis is primary central nervous system posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PCNSL). PCNSL is a rare but aggressive B-cell lymphoma that occurs in the central nervous system (CNS) of patients who have undergone organ transplantation. The incidence of PCNSL is estimated to be 1-2 cases per 1000 patient-years. The risk of developing PCNSL is highest in patients who have received an allogeneic transplant, particularly those who have received a T-cell-depleted graft. Other risk factors for PCNSL include the use of calcineurin inhibitors, such as tacrolimus, and a history of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection.

The clinical presentation of PCNSL is variable and can range from subtle to overt. Symptoms may include headache, seizures, focal neurological deficits, and cognitive impairment. In some cases, PCNSL may present as a mass lesion on imaging studies. The diagnosis of PCNSL is made by biopsy of the CNS lesion. The treatment of PCNSL is typically with high-dose chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. The prognosis for patients with PCNSL is poor, with a median survival of 12-18 months.

The patient is a 65-year-old Vietnamese man with hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic hepatitis B with cirrhosis who presented with a 2-week history of shortness of breath at rest, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. He reported a 4-month history of nonproductive cough, 5-kg weight loss, and fatigue. He immigrated to the United States as an adult more than 20 years before presentation. His temperature was 37°C, heart rate was 78/min, respiratory rate was 17/min, and blood pressure was 158/95 mm Hg. A chest radiographic image suggested cardiomegaly and a computed tomographic scan demonstrated a moderate to large pericardial effusion. A pericardial drain was placed and pericardial fluid was sent to the laboratory for evaluation. Initial pericardial fluid study results are presented in the Table. Empirical treatment for tuberculosis was initiated. Three days later, an adenosine deaminase (ADA) level of 118.1 U/L (normal range, 0.0-11.3 U/L) from pericardial fluid was reported from the laboratory.

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is tuberculous pericarditis. The patient has several risk factors for tuberculosis, including his age, ethnicity, and history of immigration. The chest radiographic image and computed tomographic scan are consistent with pericardial effusion. The elevated ADA level is a highly sensitive and specific marker for tuberculous pericarditis.

The next step in management is to stop further nontubercular diagnostic testing and continue antitubercular therapy. The patient should be treated with a four-drug regimen of isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol for a minimum of 9 months. He should also be monitored closely for signs of complications, such as cardiac tamponade.

The patient is a 51-year-old man with a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and nephrolithiasis who presents to the emergency department with left flank and left upper quadrant abdominal pain. He stated that “I think I have a kidney stone blocking my kidney” but denied nausea, vomiting, fever, dysuria, hematuria, or weight loss. He had no history of chronic abdominal pain. Past surgical history was noteworthy for emergency exploratory laparotomy and splenectomy for blunt trauma 14 years prior. Physical examination revealed a comfortable-appearing patient in no acute distress. His temperature was 36.8°C; pulse, 77/min; and blood pressure, 125/86 mm Hg. Abdominal palpation elicited only mild epigastric tenderness without masses or rebound. There was no costovertebral angle tenderness. Laboratory data revealed normal levels of serum urea nitrogen and creatinine and normal liver function. A complete blood cell count showed leukocytosis (15 300/μL with 54% neutrophils, 38% lymphocytes, 8% monocytes); hemoglobin level, 15.5 g/dL; and hematocrit, 45.2%. Urinalysis revealed no red or white blood cells and was negative for leukocyte esterase and nitrate. A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a well-circumscribed mass with a small focus of central high density resulting in surrounding streak artifact (Figure 1).

The differential diagnosis for a well-circumscribed mass with a small focus of central high density resulting in surrounding streak artifact on CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis is broad and includes neoplasms (both benign and malignant), infection, inflammation, and trauma. In this case, the patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with any of the more common causes of a well-circumscribed mass on CT scan, such as a kidney stone or appendicitis. The patient's leukocytosis is non-specific and could be due to a number of factors, including infection, inflammation, or neoplasm. The absence of red or white blood cells on urinalysis makes infection or inflammation less likely. The presence of a small focus of central high density on CT scan suggests the possibility of a neoplasm.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to perform an interventional radiology–guided biopsy of the mass. This procedure will allow for definitive diagnosis of the mass and will guide further management.

She was admitted for treatment of presumed fungal pneumonia based on new pulmonary nodules on imaging and elevated serum β-D-glucan levels. She subsequently developed multiple asymptomatic pink papules on the trunk and extremities. The patient was afebrile and was receiving broad-spectrum antibiotic, antifungal, and antiviral treatment for a prior episode of neutropenic fever.

Clinical examination revealed scattered pink papules with a white firm center and dark brown core scattered throughout the chest, abdomen, back, groin, and upper and lower extremities. Laboratory workup was significant for leukopenia with neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia. Creatinine and transaminase levels were within normal limits. Blood cultures were negative. A punch biopsy from the left flank was obtained for hematoxylin-eosin staining, and a punch biopsy from the left leg was sent for tissue and fungal culture. Histopathological analysis was subsequently performed.

The histopathological findings showed a perforating folliculitis with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate and a few fungal elements. The fungal elements were identified as Candida species.

The diagnosis of disseminated candidiasis with transepidermal elimination is most likely in this patient. This is supported by the patient's history of acute myeloid leukemia, her leukopenia with neutropenia, her clinical presentation, and the histopathological findings.

The patient presents with a 4-month history of widespread thickened, verrucous, hyperpigmented plaques distributed symmetrically on her body, especially on the axillae (Figure 1A), anogenital region, inguinal skin, and both palms, with slight itching. The verrucous plaques also involved the conjunctiva, lips, and gingiva (Figure 1B). The patient had experienced a weight loss of 6 kg during the last 3 months. Within the last month, the patient’s thyroid became enlarged, and she developed anorexia and abdominal discomfort. Laboratory test results revealed remarkably elevated levels of carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 19-9, carbohydrate antigen 125, tissue polypeptide antigen and carbohydrate antigen 242. Biopsy specimens of lesions on the axillae and lips both revealed a papillary structure with hyperkeratosis. An endoscopic examination and computed tomographic scan of the abdomen were performed.

The most likely diagnosis is **malignant acanthosis nigricans**. Malignant acanthosis nigricans is a rare, acquired dermatosis characterized by hyperpigmented, velvety plaques with a verrucous surface. It is associated with a variety of endocrine, metabolic, and neoplastic disorders. The most common association is with internal malignancy, particularly adenocarcinoma of the stomach, pancreas, and colon. Other associated conditions include obesity, insulin resistance, and polycystic ovary syndrome.

The diagnosis of malignant acanthosis nigricans is made clinically based on the characteristic skin findings. Biopsy of the lesions may be helpful to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out other conditions that can mimic malignant acanthosis nigricans, such as benign acanthosis nigricans, seborrheic keratosis, and verrucous carcinoma.

The treatment of malignant acanthosis nigricans is directed at the underlying cause. In patients with malignancy, treatment is with the appropriate chemotherapeutic or radiation therapy. In patients with non-malignant conditions, treatment is aimed at controlling the underlying condition and improving the appearance of the skin lesions.

Social history was significant for 25 pack-years of smoking. Physical examination revealed multiple well-defined, coalescent, erythematous, palpable, purpuralike lesions that were predominantly present over the trunk and lower extremities. Laboratory test results at presentation included a hemoglobin level of 11.2 g/dL (to convert to g/L, multiply by 10), mean corpuscular volume of 84 fL, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 72 mm/h, and a lactate dehydrogenase level of 412 IU/L. Hepatic and renal function levels were within normal limits. Complement levels were normal. Hepatitis B and C and HIV profiles were negative. A chest radiograph showed a 2-cm lesion in the upper lobe of the left lung. A computed tomographic scan of the chest showed a spiculated mass in the same region along with mediastinal lymphadenopathy. An ultrasound of the abdomen showed bilateral adrenal masses. A lesional skin biopsy specimen was obtained.

The most likely diagnosis is cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis. This is a small vessel vasculitis characterized by leukocytoclastic inflammation of the blood vessels. It can present with a variety of symptoms, including purpura, skin ulcers, arthralgias, fever, and weight loss. The diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and skin biopsy. The treatment is with corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive medications.

The other possible diagnoses are acrokeratosis paraneoplastica, purpura fulminans, and Henoch-Schönlein purpura. Acrokeratosis paraneoplastica is a rare skin condition that is associated with underlying malignancy. It is characterized by thickened, erythematous skin on the palms and soles. Purpura fulminans is a life-threatening condition that is characterized by widespread purpura, shock, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Henoch-Schönlein purpura is a vasculitis that is most commonly seen in children. It is characterized by palpable purpura, arthralgias, abdominal pain, and renal involvement.

In this case, the patient's clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and skin biopsy are most consistent with the diagnosis of cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The patient should be treated with corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive medications.

The patient is a woman in her early 60s with a medical history of chest pain requiring a coronary angiogram (which demonstrated only mild luminal irregularities) approximately 1 year prior to presentation, hypertension, long-standing dyslipidemia, and multiparity presented to the emergency department with a sudden onset of dull, pressurelike chest pain radiating to the left arm. The pain started at rest, was 10 of 10 in severity, and was not alleviated by changing position. She also experienced concomitant nausea and diaphoresis. Her family history was notable for hypertension, and no other systemic diseases were reported. On physical examination, her blood pressure was 115/76 mm Hg, heart rate was regular at 72 beats per minute, respiratory rate was 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation level was 98% on room air. The patient was afebrile. Physical examination also revealed mild bibasilar crackles and jugular venous distention, and no murmurs or lower extremity edema. Laboratory test results demonstrated an elevated troponin, and the 12-lead electrocardiogram showed marked ST-segment elevations in leads V2 to V5. The ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) pager was activated, and the patient was transferred urgently to the catheterization laboratory. Coronary angiography of the patient’s left anterior descending coronary artery was performed, and the findings are depicted in the Figure, B.

The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with an acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The ECG findings show marked ST-segment elevations in leads V2 to V5, which are typical of an AMI involving the left anterior descending coronary artery. The coronary angiogram shows a 90% stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery.

The treatment of an AMI includes revascularization and medical therapy. Revascularization is the process of restoring blood flow to the ischemic myocardium. This can be done with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Medical therapy includes medications to stabilize the patient, prevent further cardiac events, and reduce the risk of death.

In this case, the patient should be treated with aspirin, a β-blocker, clopidogrel, and a statin. Aspirin is a blood thinner that helps to prevent clots from forming. A β-blocker is a medication that helps to lower blood pressure and reduce the workload of the heart. Clopidogrel is a medication that helps to prevent platelets from clumping together. A statin is a medication that helps to lower cholesterol levels.

The patient should also be considered for PCI. PCI is a minimally invasive procedure that involves inserting a balloon into the narrowed coronary artery and inflating it to widen the artery. This procedure can restore blood flow to the ischemic myocardium and improve the patient's prognosis.

**Answer:**

D. Revascularize with percutaneous coronary intervention and start medical therapy.

The patient is a 59-year-old Hispanic woman with a history of stage IV endometrial serous adenocarcinoma (ESA) 4 years prior that was treated with total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, and peritoneal lavage. She had developed a recurrence for which she had just completed 3 cycles of treatment with carboplatin. She also had a history of anxiety, hypertension, and pterygium, and she was taking gabapentin, lorazepam, prochlorperazine, metoprolol succinate, bromfenac and ketorolac ophthalmic solution, and aprepitant.

On intraoral examination, there is a 1.5 × 1.0-cm firm, erythematous gingival mass in the area of missing right mandibular second bicuspid and first molar with buccal and lingual expansion. The right mandibular first bicuspid is grade 3 mobile. A periapical radiograph was obtained, and results showed a diffuse, poorly demarcated radiolucency measuring approximately 1.2 × 0.8 cm. Findings from an incisional biopsy of the mass showed an infiltrative tumor. Tumor cells were positive for CK7, PAX8, and WT-1, and negative for CK20 and TTF-1.

Based on the patient's history, presentation, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is oral metastasis from her endometrial cancer. Pyogenic granuloma, gingival/periodontal abscess, and squamous cell carcinoma are all possible diagnoses, but they are less likely given the patient's history and presentation.

He is febrile to 101°F and denies any dysphonia or dyspnea. The results of a rapid Streptococcus test, recent HIV screen, and a rapid plasma reagin test were all negative. He denied any genital lesions or symptoms at that time. He had been taking prophylactic emtricitabine-tenofovir daily and had received his last diphtheria booster 2 years prior to presentation. Treatment with amoxicillin clavulanate over several days had not prevented a worsening of his symptoms. On physical examination, there was no cervical lymphadenopathy, and there were no genital lesions. Flexible fiber-optic nasopharyngoscopy showed ulcerative lesions with exudate and erythema extending diffusely along the base of tongue, oropharynx, nasopharynx, hypopharynx, and epiglottis (Figure 1).

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes diphtheria, mononucleosis, type 2 herpes simplex virus (HSV-2) pharyngitis, and pharyngeal gonorrhea.

Diphtheria is a bacterial infection caused by Corynebacterium diphtheriae. It is characterized by a membrane that forms on the back of the throat, which can lead to airway obstruction. The patient in this case does not have a membrane on the back of his throat, so diphtheria is less likely.

Mononucleosis is a viral infection caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). It is characterized by fever, sore throat, lymphadenopathy, and fatigue. The patient in this case does not have lymphadenopathy, so mononucleosis is less likely.

Type 2 HSV-2 is a viral infection that can cause genital herpes. It can also cause pharyngitis, which is characterized by a sore throat, fever, and ulcers in the throat. The patient in this case has a history of pharyngeal gonorrhea, which is a sexually transmitted infection. It is possible that he also has type 2 HSV-2, which could explain his current symptoms.

Pharyngeal gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted infection caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. It is characterized by a sore throat, fever, and ulcers in the throat. The patient in this case has a history of pharyngeal gonorrhea, and his current symptoms are consistent with this diagnosis.

The patient is a woman in her 60s with a history of end-stage renal disease who had a kidney transplant 9 months previously. She presented with progressive cough, dyspnea, and hoarseness. Her history also included chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and a 14-pack-year smoking history. She initially presented 3 months prior with upper respiratory symptoms, which continued to worsen despite oral antibiotic therapy. Her cough became productive with white, frothy phlegm that was accompanied by fever, wheezing, hoarseness, and fatigue. Her dyspnea worsened in the supine position.

Flexible laryngotracheoscopy results revealed diffuse, white-to-yellow pseudomembranous changes involving the glottis and supraglottis, posterior tracheal wall, and left mainstem bronchus with skip lesions in the subglottis and distal 1 cm of the trachea. Glottic mobility was limited in both abduction and adduction with substantial airway obstruction. Computed tomographic findings revealed posterior tracheal wall thickening with the loss of the fat plane between the trachea and esophagus, and a moderate to severe obstruction within the distal left mainstem bronchus. Biopsy results showed branching organisms superficial to squamous epithelium.

The most likely diagnosis is **nocardiosis**. Nocardiosis is a rare, opportunistic infection caused by the bacterium Nocardia. It is most commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, such as those with a history of organ transplantation. The most common symptoms of nocardiosis are fever, cough, and dyspnea. The infection can spread to the lungs, brain, skin, and other organs. Nocardiosis is treated with antibiotics.

The other possible diagnoses are all less likely in this patient. Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder is a type of cancer that can develop in patients who have undergone organ transplantation. It is most common in the first year after transplantation. The most common symptoms of posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder are fever, fatigue, and lymphadenopathy. It is treated with chemotherapy. Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that can develop in the lungs, esophagus, or other parts of the body. It is most common in people who smoke or are exposed to secondhand smoke. The most common symptoms of squamous cell carcinoma are cough, hoarseness, and difficulty breathing. It is treated with surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy. Aspergillosis is a fungal infection that can affect the lungs, sinuses, or other parts of the body. It is most common in people who have a weakened immune system.

 34%|███▍      | 523/1525 [2:01:37<3:52:20, 13.91s/it]The answer is: D. Nasal cavity hamartoma.

Reasoning:

* The patient is an 80-year-old man with acromegaly due to a hypoenhancing pituitary microadenoma. He opted for transsphenoidal resection. Preoperative magnetic resonance imaging examination of the sella revealed a left-sided pituitary microadenoma and lobulated polypoid soft tissue masses in the superior nasal cavities arising from the olfactory clefts. These lesions demonstrated avid post–contrast enhancement with small areas of cystic change and heterogeneously hyperintense T2 signal. There was mild widening of the olfactory clefts, particularly on the left side. The intervening nasal septum was intact, and there was no intracranial extension. The patient did not have any noteworthy rhinological symptoms on review. He later underwent nasal endoscopy, and results showed tan-colored polypoid lesions emanating from the olfactory clefts of both nasal cavities. Biopsy findings revealed submucosal proliferation of seromucinous and respiratory epithelial glands.

* Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is a nasal cavity hamartoma. Hamartomas are benign tumors that are composed of normal tissue elements that are not arranged in a normal pattern. They are most commonly found in the head and neck region, and they can occur in any age group. Nasal cavity hamartoma is the most common type of hamartoma in the head and neck region, and it accounts for approximately 10% of all nasal tumors.

* The typical presentation of a nasal cavity hamartoma is a unilateral nasal mass that is often associated with obstruction, epistaxis, and headache. The mass is typically soft and polypoid, and it may be friable. On imaging, nasal cavity hamartomas are typically hypodense on non-contrast CT scans and hyperintense on T2-weighted MR images. They may also show enhancement with contrast administration.

* The treatment of nasal cavity hamartoma is surgical excision. This is typically performed endoscopically, and the goal of surgery is to completely remove the tumor. The prognosis for patients with nasal cavity hamartoma is excellent, and most patients have a good outcome following surgery.

* Inflammatory nasal polyps are a common condition that is characterized by the growth of polyps in the nasal cavity. Polyps are soft, fleshy masses that are typically non-cancerous. They can cause a variety of symptoms, including nasal obstruction, congestion, and discharge. Inflammatory nasal polyps are typically treated with medications, such as steroids or antihistamines. Surgery may be necessary in some cases.

* Inverted papilloma is a rare type of benign tumor that grows in the nasal cavity. It is typically a slow-growing tumor that can cause a variety of symptoms, including nasal obstruction, congestion, and discharge. Inverted papilloma is typically treated with surgery.

* Nasal cavity hamartoma is a benign tumor that is composed of normal tissue elements that are not arranged in a normal pattern.

She now presents with intermittent diplopia that is provoked after looking to the right. On examination, she has a large-angle exotropia on return to primary gaze after a sustained right gaze, and a limitation of adduction of the right eye. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of sixth nerve palsy.

Sixth nerve palsy can be caused by a variety of factors, including trauma, ischemia, and tumors. In this case, the most likely cause is radiation-induced damage to the sixth nerve. The patient's history of pituitary macroadenoma and prior treatment with surgery and radiosurgery make her at risk for radiation-induced damage to cranial nerves, including the sixth nerve.

The next step in management is to order a cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate for any evidence of tumor recurrence or radiation-induced damage to the brain. If the MRI is negative, the patient can be treated with a trial of carbamazepine, which is a medication that can be effective in treating sixth nerve palsy. If the patient does not respond to carbamazepine, she may need to undergo surgical treatment to repair the sixth nerve palsy.

The mass has been present since birth and is asymptomatic aside from rare episodes of pink tears. The patient has no blurry vision, diplopia, or pain with eye movements. His visual acuity is 20/20 OU, and there is no proptosis, ptosis, or afferent pupillary defect. Extraocular muscle movements are intact, and his intraocular pressure is 15 mm Hg OU. There was no change in lesion size observed with the Valsalva maneuver. A slitlamp examination revealed an 8-mm, round, fluctuant, vascular, multifocal mass involving the bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva near the lateral canthus. The results of the rest of the examinations, including cornea, anterior chamber, and dilated fundus examinations, were normal in both eyes.

The differential diagnosis for a large, vascular, multifocal mass involving the bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva near the lateral canthus includes hemangioma, lymphangioma, and capillary hemangioma. Hemangiomas are the most common type of vascular tumor in the pediatric population, and they are typically benign. Lymphangiomas are less common than hemangiomas, and they can be either benign or malignant. Capillary hemangiomas are the most common type of hemangioma in adults, and they are typically benign.

The next step in the management of this patient is to obtain a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits to rule out any intracranial or orbital involvement. If the MRI is negative, then the patient can be treated with excisional biopsy of the lesion. If the MRI is positive, then the patient will need to be referred to a specialist for further management.

The visual acuity has worsened to 20/200. The mass is located in the posterior pole, which is the most important area of the retina for vision. The options are:

A. Photodynamic therapy: This is a treatment that uses a light-activated drug to destroy cancer cells. It is not a good option for this patient because the mass is located in the posterior pole, which is a sensitive area of the retina.

B. Iodine 125 plaque brachytherapy: This is a treatment that uses radioactive pellets to destroy cancer cells. It is a good option for this patient because it is a safe and effective treatment for choroidal masses.

C. Anti–vascular endothelial growth factor therapy injections: This is a treatment that uses drugs to block the growth of new blood vessels. It is not a good option for this patient because the mass is not vascular.

D. External beam radiotherapy: This is a treatment that uses high-energy radiation to destroy cancer cells. It is not a good option for this patient because it can damage the healthy tissue around the tumor.

The patient has a history of pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, a genetic disorder that can cause optic nerve atrophy and visual field loss. He also has a family history of glaucoma, which is another possible cause of visual field loss. The patient's current symptoms, including optic nerve cupping, visual field deficits, and a relative afferent pupillary defect, are consistent with both optic nerve atrophy and glaucoma.

A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain/orbits is the best test to rule out other possible causes of the patient's visual field loss, such as a brain tumor or a pituitary tumor. An MRI can also help to assess the extent of the patient's optic nerve atrophy.

Observation, referral to endocrinology, and repeated visual fields with IOP check in 1 month are not the best next steps in this case. Observation is not appropriate because the patient's visual field loss is progressive. Referral to endocrinology is not appropriate because the patient's visual field loss is not likely due to a thyroid disorder. Repeated visual fields with IOP check in 1 month is not appropriate because the patient's visual field loss is already severe and is likely to continue to progress.

Therefore, the best next step in this case is to order a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain/orbits.

The patient is presenting with a fever, hypotension, and bilateral lung crackles. These findings are concerning for infective endocarditis. Infective endocarditis is a bacterial infection of the heart valves. It is a serious condition that can lead to death. The most common symptoms of infective endocarditis are fever, chills, fatigue, and weight loss. Other symptoms may include night sweats, joint pain, and petechiae (small red spots on the skin).

The diagnosis of infective endocarditis is made based on clinical findings, blood cultures, and echocardiography. Echocardiography is a test that uses sound waves to create images of the heart. It can be used to see if there is any damage to the heart valves or if there are any vegetations (clumps of bacteria) on the valves.

The treatment for infective endocarditis is antibiotics. The type of antibiotic that is used will depend on the type of bacteria that is causing the infection. The patient will also need to be hospitalized so that they can be monitored closely.

In the case of the patient described in the question, the most likely cause of his fever, hypotension, and bilateral lung crackles is infective endocarditis. The patient should be started on broad-spectrum antibiotics and observed closely. If the patient does not improve with antibiotics, he may need to undergo surgery to repair the damaged valve.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each of the answer choices:

**A. Order diuresis with furosemide and serial echocardiograms.** Diuresis is the removal of fluid from the body. Furosemide is a medication that is used to promote diuresis. Serial echocardiograms are a series of echocardiograms that are performed over time. In the case of the patient described in the question, diuretics and serial echocardiograms would not be the most appropriate treatment. The patient is not in acute heart failure, and there is no evidence of worsening aortic regurgitation.

**B. Perform emergency surgery for aortic valve repair.** Emergency surgery for aortic valve repair is a high-risk procedure. It is only indicated in patients who are hemodynamically unstable or who have evidence of worsening aortic regurgitation. In the case of the patient described in the question, the patient is not hemodynamically unstable, and there is no evidence of worsening aortic regurgitation. Therefore, emergency surgery for aortic valve repair would not be the most appropriate treatment.

**C. Place an intra-aortic balloon pump.** An intra-aortic balloon pump is a device that is inserted into the aorta to provide temporary support to the heart. It is used in patients who are hemodynamically unstable. In the case of the patient described in the question, the patient is not hemodynamically unstable. Therefore, placing an intra-aortic balloon pump would not be the most appropriate treatment.

**D. Start broad-spectrum antibiotics and observe.** Starting broad-spectrum antibiotics and observing the patient is the most appropriate treatment in the case of the patient described in the question. The patient is presenting with fever, hypotension, and bilateral lung crackles. These findings are concerning for infective endocarditis. Infective endocarditis is a bacterial infection of the heart valves. It is a serious condition that can lead to death. The most common symptoms of infective endocarditis are fever, chills, fatigue, and weight loss. Other symptoms may include night sweats, joint pain, and petechiae (small red spots on the skin).

The patient is a man in his 60s with a 10-year history of a slowly progressive, asymptomatic cutaneous eruption on his left leg. He has a 16-year history of diabetes mellitus that is being treated with metformin. Hematological and biochemical test results were unremarkable. There was no history of another endocrine disorder or malignant neoplasm. There was no family history of similar cutaneous findings. Physical examination revealed reddish brown hyperkeratotic papules 1 to 10 mm wide on the front and back of the left leg from knee to ankle. The rest of the physical examination findings were unremarkable. Removal of the scales caused slight bleeding. A lesional skin biopsy was performed.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes stucco keratoses, hyperkeratosis lenticularis perstans, disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis, and Kyrle disease.

Stucco keratoses are small, asymptomatic, hyperkeratotic papules that are typically found on the palms and soles. They are thought to be caused by chronic friction or trauma.

Hyperkeratosis lenticularis perstans is a rare, chronic skin disorder characterized by small, hyperkeratotic papules that are typically found on the extremities. The cause is unknown, but it is thought to be a genetic disorder.

Disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis is a chronic, slowly progressive skin disorder characterized by small, hyperkeratotic papules that are typically found on sun-exposed areas of the skin. It is caused by a mutation in the CDKN2A gene.

Kyrle disease is a rare, genetic disorder characterized by the formation of warty papules and plaques on the skin. It is caused by a mutation in the LRP5 gene.

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis. This is because the patient has a history of sun exposure, the lesions are located on sun-exposed areas of the skin, and the biopsy findings are consistent with disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis.
