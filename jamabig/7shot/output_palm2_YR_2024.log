  0%|          | 0/1525 [00:00<?, ?it/s]The answer is: **B: Arrange endoscopy.**

Explanation:

The patient has four radio-opaque coin-shaped opacities in the stomach, which are most likely foreign bodies. The patient's clinical presentation of intermittent apneic episodes, hypoxia, and mental status changes is consistent with aspiration of a foreign body. Endoscopy is the most appropriate procedure to remove the foreign bodies and prevent further complications.

Activated charcoal is not effective in removing foreign bodies from the stomach. Gastric lavage is not recommended for foreign bodies in the stomach because it can increase the risk of aspiration. Supportive care, such as oxygen therapy and intravenous fluids, is important but not sufficient treatment for a patient with a foreign body in the stomach.

  0%|          | 1/1525 [00:07<3:20:09,  7.88s/it]The correct answer is: C. Emphysematous thyroiditis.

Explanation:

The patient presented with a high-grade fever, neck pain, and a foreign body sensation in the throat after eating chicken 3 days prior. Laboratory investigations demonstrated an elevated leukocyte count. Lateral soft tissue radiography showed a radio-opaque foreign body at the level of C6. Computed tomography (CT) scan confirmed a 2-cm radio-opaque osseous foreign body at the level of the cricopharyngeus muscle with signs of esophageal perforation, including air leak tracking toward the left lobe of the thyroid gland. The patient was brought to the operating room, and the esophageal foreign body was successfully removed. Postoperatively, the patient continued to become febrile despite intravenous antibiotic therapy. A repeated CT scan of the neck and chest was done, which showed gas in the thyroid gland.

These findings are most consistent with emphysematous thyroiditis, a rare complication of esophageal perforation. Emphysematous thyroiditis is characterized by the presence of gas in the thyroid gland, which is caused by infection with gas-forming bacteria. The most common bacteria associated with emphysematous thyroiditis are Bacteroides fragilis and Escherichia coli.

The clinical presentation of emphysematous thyroiditis is variable. Some patients may present with fever, neck pain, and dysphagia, while others may be asymptomatic. The diagnosis of emphysematous thyroiditis is made with CT scan, which shows gas in the thyroid gland. Treatment of emphysematous thyroiditis is with antibiotics and surgical drainage.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation and imaging findings. Parapharyngeal abscess is a collection of pus in the parapharyngeal space, which is a potential space located between the pharynx and the mandible. Retropharyngeal abscess is a collection of pus in the retropharyngeal space, which is a potential space located between the pharynx and the prevertebral fascia. Mediastinitis is inflammation of the mediastinum, which is the central compartment of the chest.

Explanation:
The patient's clinical presentation is highly suspicious for infection, and the Tzanck smear findings are consistent with herpes simplex virus (HSV). HSV is a common viral infection that can cause a variety of skin lesions, including papules, pustules, and ulcers. The lesions are often painful and can be accompanied by fever, headache, and lymphadenopathy. HSV is typically spread through contact with infected skin or fluids. In immunocompromised patients, HSV infections can be more severe and widespread.

The Tzanck smear is a simple diagnostic test that can be used to quickly identify HSV infection. The test involves scraping cells from the base of an ulcerated lesion and staining them with a special dye. If HSV is present, the cells will show characteristic changes, including ballooning of the keratinocytes and peripheralization of the nuclear material.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation or the findings of the Tzanck smear. Histoplasmosis is a fungal infection that can cause a variety of symptoms, including fever, cough, and chest pain. Molluscum contagiosum is a viral infection that causes small, raised bumps on the skin. Mpox is a viral infection that causes small, red bumps on the skin that are often itchy.

  0%|          | 3/1525 [00:34<4:56:33, 11.69s/it]The correct answer is: A. Perform a bone marrow biopsy.

The patient has a history of bladder carcinoma and is currently receiving chemotherapy. He presents with fatigue, dyspnea on exertion, and a recent increase in his white blood cell count with a significant number of blasts. These findings are concerning for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A bone marrow biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of AML. It can confirm the presence of blasts in the bone marrow and provide information about the type of AML. This information is essential for determining the best course of treatment.

Prescribing all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) or starting cytoreductive therapy with hydroxyurea would be premature without a definitive diagnosis of AML. ATRA and hydroxyurea are both effective treatments for AML, but they can have serious side effects. It is important to weigh the risks and benefits of these treatments before starting them.

Repeating a complete blood cell count with differential in 1 to 2 weeks would not be helpful in this case. The patient's white blood cell count is already elevated and there is a significant number of blasts. A repeat blood count would not provide any additional information that would change the management of the patient.

Therefore, the best course of action is to perform a bone marrow biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of AML and determine the best course of treatment.

  0%|          | 4/1525 [00:50<5:41:09, 13.46s/it]The answer is: C. Perineural spread of cutaneous malignancy.

Explanation:
The patient has a history of a left cheek melanoma, which is a type of cutaneous malignancy. He has also had numerous other cutaneous squamous and basal cell carcinomas of the bilateral head and neck. The patient's current symptoms, including progressive right-sided facial numbness and weakness, vision changes, and headaches, are consistent with perineural spread of cutaneous malignancy.

Perineural spread of cutaneous malignancy is a rare but well-described phenomenon. It occurs when malignant cells from a primary cutaneous tumor invade the perineural spaces and travel along cranial nerves. This can lead to a variety of neurological symptoms, depending on the cranial nerves involved. In this case, the patient's symptoms are consistent with involvement of cranial nerves VII, V, and III.

The diagnosis of perineural spread of cutaneous malignancy is often made based on clinical suspicion and supported by imaging studies. MRI is the most sensitive imaging modality for detecting perineural spread of malignancy. In this case, the patient's MRI showed abnormal enhancement of the right facial nerve.

There is no curative treatment for perineural spread of cutaneous malignancy. Treatment is aimed at controlling the symptoms and preventing progression of the disease. This may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and/or immunotherapy.

The patient's prognosis depends on a number of factors, including the type and stage of the primary cutaneous malignancy, the extent of perineural spread, and the patient's overall health. In general, patients with perineural spread of cutaneous malignancy have a poor prognosis. However, with aggressive treatment, some patients may achieve long-term survival.

The other possible diagnoses are not as likely in this case. Primary leptomeningeal lymphoma is a rare type of cancer that starts in the cerebrospinal fluid. It is more common in people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS or cancer. Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is a rare inflammatory disorder that affects the cranial nerves. It is more common in women than men. Sphenoid wing meningioma is a type of brain tumor that starts in the sphenoid wing, a bone in the skull base. It is more common in women than men.

  0%|          | 5/1525 [01:06<6:07:56, 14.52s/it]The correct answer is: D. Myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene fusions.

Explanation:

The patient in the case report presents with a number of clinical features that are consistent with a diagnosis of myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene fusions. These features include:

* Marked leukocytosis with a high percentage of eosinophils (>55%)
* Hypereosinophilia (absolute eosinophil count >10,000/μL)
* Bone marrow involvement with increased eosinophils and some dysplasia
* Positive lymph node biopsy for atypical cells with high proliferation index (Ki-67 >95%) that are positive for CD3, CD4, CD8, BCL2, and TDT
* Positron emission tomographic–computed tomographic (PET/CT) scan showing a left upper cervical lymph node of 2.6 cm and a left inguinal lymph node of 3.1 × 2.3 cm with an standardized uptake value max of 5.7

These features are consistent with the diagnosis of myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene fusions, which is a rare hematologic malignancy that is characterized by the presence of a fusion gene between the FIP1L1 and PDGFRA genes. This fusion gene leads to the production of a chimeric protein that is constitutively active and drives the proliferation of eosinophils.

The treatment of myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene fusions typically involves the use of chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Chemotherapy is used to kill the cancer cells, while targeted therapy is used to block the activity of the chimeric protein. The prognosis for patients with this condition varies depending on the stage of disease at diagnosis, but most patients respond well to treatment.

The other possible diagnoses in the case report are not as consistent with the patient's clinical features. Kimura disease is a rare, benign disorder that is characterized by the formation of lymphadenopathy, angioedema, and eosinophilia. Classic Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of lymphoma that is characterized by the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells. T-cell acute lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia is a type of leukemia that is characterized by the presence of immature T-lymphocytes. These conditions do not typically present with the same clinical features as myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and tyrosine kinase gene fusions.

  0%|          | 6/1525 [01:23<6:24:21, 15.18s/it]The answer is: B. Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease.

Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease is a rare, self-limiting inflammatory disorder of lymph nodes that predominantly affects young adults. It is characterized by fever, lymphadenopathy, and skin rash. The lymphadenopathy is usually unilateral and cervical, but it can involve other lymph node chains. The skin rash is typically a papular or nodular eruption that is often pruritic. The diagnosis of Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease is made based on the clinical presentation and histopathologic findings. The histopathologic findings are characteristic, showing extensive necrosis, apoptosis, and karyorrhectic debris. Treatment is supportive and the disease usually resolves spontaneously within a few weeks.

The other options are incorrect because they do not fit the clinical presentation of the patient. Lymphoma is a malignant neoplasm of lymphocytes. It can present with lymphadenopathy, fever, and weight loss. However, the patient in this case did not have any of these symptoms. Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organ systems, including the skin, joints, kidneys, and heart. It can present with fever, rash, joint pain, and fatigue. However, the patient in this case did not have any of these symptoms. Rosai-Dorfman disease is a rare, non-neoplastic disorder of dendritic cells. It can present with lymphadenopathy, fever, and skin rash. However, the patient in this case did not have any of these symptoms.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for the patient in this case is Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease.

  0%|          | 7/1525 [01:39<6:36:18, 15.66s/it]Answer: A. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

Explanation:

The patient is an elderly woman with a history of breast cancer and pulmonary nodules. She presents with symptoms of fever, hemoptysis, and syncopal episodes. Her electrocardiogram shows monomorphic ventricular tachycardia with a morphology suggesting right ventricular origin. She is currently stable after receiving intravenous amiodarone hydrochloride and correction of mild hypokalemia.

The next step in management is to determine the cause of the ventricular tachycardia. Cardiac MRI is the best test to evaluate the heart for structural abnormalities that may be causing the arrhythmia. Cardiac MRI can also assess the function of the left and right ventricles, which is important in this patient with known pulmonary nodules and mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

Electrophysiology study (EPS) is a procedure that can be used to diagnose and treat arrhythmias. However, EPS is not necessary in this patient because she is currently stable and the cause of her ventricular tachycardia is unknown. Genetic testing may be helpful in some patients with ventricular tachycardia, but it is not necessary in this patient because she does not have a family history of arrhythmias. Implantation of a cardiac defibrillator is a treatment option for patients with ventricular tachycardia, but it is not necessary in this patient because she is currently stable and does not have a history of cardiac arrest.

Therefore, the next best step in management is to perform a cardiac MRI to determine the cause of the ventricular tachycardia.

  1%|          | 8/1525 [01:56<6:41:08, 15.87s/it]The correct answer is C: Diffuse-type neurofibroma.

Arteriovenous malformation of the scalp is a rare congenital vascular anomaly characterized by the abnormal communication between arteries and veins. It is usually diagnosed in childhood or early adulthood and can present with a variety of symptoms, including headaches, seizures, and visual disturbances. On imaging, arteriovenous malformations of the scalp appear as a mass with a characteristic "spoke-wheel" appearance. Treatment is usually not required unless the lesion is causing symptoms.

Solitary fibrous tumor is a rare mesenchymal tumor that can occur in any part of the body, including the scalp. It is typically diagnosed in adults and can present with a variety of symptoms, including a mass, pain, and tenderness. On imaging, solitary fibrous tumors appear as a well-defined mass with a heterogeneous appearance. Treatment is usually surgical excision.

Diffuse-type neurofibroma is a type of neurofibroma that is characterized by a diffuse proliferation of Schwann cells. It is a common finding in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Diffuse-type neurofibromas can occur anywhere in the body, including the scalp. They typically present as a soft, rubbery mass that is often associated with pain and tenderness. On imaging, diffuse-type neurofibromas appear as a well-defined mass with a heterogeneous appearance. Treatment is usually surgical excision.

Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is a rare type of skin cancer that can occur anywhere on the body, including the scalp. It is typically diagnosed in adults and can present with a variety of symptoms, including a lump, pain, and bleeding. On imaging, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans appears as a well-defined mass with a heterogeneous appearance. Treatment is usually surgical excision.

In the case presented, the patient is a 27-year-old woman with a history of a slowly growing mass on her left scalp. The mass is described as being spongy and pulsatile, and it is associated with overlying hair loss. On imaging, the mass appears as a well-defined, diffuse, intensely enhancing scalp lesion with very prominent vascularity and underlying calvarial thickening. No osseous destruction or intracranial extension is present. Subsequent catheter angiography confirmed the hypervascular mass, supplied via hypertrophied superficial temporal and occipital arteries with marked internal vascularity without direct involvement of the calvarium or intracranial structures. The patient underwent biopsy under general anesthesia; the specimen showed an ill-defined deep dermal/subcutaneous proliferation of spindle cells without significant nuclear pleomorphism or mitotic activity. The lesions stained positive for S100 and SOX10 immunostains.

Based on the information presented, the most likely diagnosis is diffuse-type neurofibroma. This is supported by the patient's history of a slowly growing mass on her left scalp, the imaging findings of a well-defined, diffuse, intensely enhancing scalp lesion with very prominent vascularity and underlying calvarial thickening, and the biopsy findings of an ill-defined deep dermal/subcutaneous proliferation of spindle cells without significant nuclear pleomorphism or mitotic activity. The other possible diagnoses are less likely based on the information presented.

  1%|          | 9/1525 [02:11<6:38:41, 15.78s/it]The answer is **A. Chromoblastomycosis**.

Chromoblastomycosis is a chronic granulomatous fungal infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissues caused by dematiaceous fungi. It is characterized by the formation of small, warty papules that enlarge and coalesce to form nodules and plaques. The lesions are often pigmented, with a central area of scarring. Chromoblastomycosis is most commonly seen in tropical and subtropical regions, and is acquired through traumatic inoculation of the skin with contaminated soil or wood. The diagnosis is made based on clinical findings and histopathologic examination of biopsy specimens. Treatment is with antifungal agents, such as itraconazole or terbinafine.

The patient in the case presented with multiple well-defined brown erythematous scaly plaques with central scarring measuring 2 × 1 to 8 × 7 cm on the face, arm, and thighs. The patient also had saddle nose deformity, perforation of the hard palate, and necrotic plaques on the ear, causing destruction of ear cartilage. These findings are consistent with chromoblastomycosis.

The other options are incorrect. Hyalohyphomycosis is a fungal infection caused by hyaline fungi, which are fungi that have non-pigmented hyphae. Hyalohyphomycosis can affect the skin, lungs, sinuses, and other organs. Blastomycosis is a fungal infection caused by Blastomyces dermatitidis. Blastomycosis can affect the lungs, skin, bones, and other organs. Phaeohyphomycosis is a fungal infection caused by dematiaceous fungi, which are fungi that have pigmented hyphae. Phaeohyphomycosis can affect the skin, lungs, sinuses, and other organs.

In conclusion, the diagnosis of the patient in the case is chromoblastomycosis. This diagnosis is supported by the patient's clinical findings, histopathologic examination of biopsy specimens, and the geographic location of the patient.

Acute coalescent mastoiditis is a serious infection of the mastoid air cells, which are located behind the eardrum. The infection can spread to the sigmoid sinus, a vein that drains blood from the brain. This can lead to sigmoid sinus thrombosis, a blockage of the vein.

The patient in the case presented with several symptoms that are consistent with acute coalescent mastoiditis, including:

* Fever
* Headache
* Otalgia (ear pain)
* Otorrhea (ear discharge)
* Hearing loss
* Periauricular swelling and erythema
* Computed tomographic venogram confirmation of occlusion of the left transverse and sigmoid sinuses
* Computed tomography of the temporal bone showing coalescence of mastoid air cells with erosion into the sigmoid sinus

The patient's history of seizure disorder is not relevant to the diagnosis of acute coalescent mastoiditis.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disease characterized by the proliferation of Langerhans cells, a type of white blood cell. It can affect the bones, skin, and other organs. The patient in the case does not have any symptoms that are consistent with Langerhans cell histiocytosis.

Meningioma is a type of brain tumor that originates from the meninges, the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. The patient in the case does not have any symptoms that are consistent with a meningioma.

Cholesteatoma is a benign tumor that can grow in the middle ear. It is caused by the accumulation of dead skin cells and debris. The patient in the case does not have any symptoms that are consistent with a cholesteatoma.

In conclusion, the correct diagnosis for the patient in the case is acute coalescent mastoiditis with sigmoid sinus thrombosis.

Leishmaniasis is a vector-borne disease caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Leishmania. It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected female sandflies. The disease is characterized by a chronic skin lesion, which can progress to ulceration and scarring. In some cases, leishmaniasis can also cause systemic disease, involving the liver, spleen, and bone marrow.

The patient in this case has a history of travel to Guyana, which is an area where leishmaniasis is endemic. He also presents with a chronic skin lesion that is consistent with leishmaniasis. The pathology findings of epithelial hyperplasia with suppurative granulomatous inflammation are also consistent with leishmaniasis.

The other possible diagnoses are not as likely. Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection that can cause a variety of symptoms, including fever, cough, and weight loss. However, it is not typically associated with skin lesions. Leprosy is a bacterial infection that can cause skin lesions, but it is usually accompanied by other symptoms, such as nerve damage and loss of sensation. Lethal midline granuloma is a rare, aggressive lymphoma that can cause a variety of symptoms, including nasal obstruction, facial swelling, and ulceration. However, it is not typically associated with skin lesions.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for the patient in this case is leishmaniasis.

Explanation:

The patient has a history of mycosis fungoides, a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that can involve the skin, lymph nodes, and other organs. The oral mucosa is a common site of involvement in mycosis fungoides, and the patient's presentation is consistent with this diagnosis. The other options are less likely diagnoses in this case.

Laugier-Hunziker syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by oral mucosal pigmentation and hyperpigmentation of the lips, palms, and soles. It is not associated with mycosis fungoides.

Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that can occur anywhere on the body, including the oral mucosa. However, the patient's presentation is not typical of melanoma. Melanoma is more likely to present as a single, pigmented lesion, rather than multiple lesions as in this case.

Medication adverse effects can cause oral mucosal pigmentation, but this is usually a side effect of certain medications, such as minocycline or amiodarone. The patient is not taking any of these medications.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is oral involvement of mycosis fungoides.

  1%|          | 13/1525 [03:03<5:28:52, 13.05s/it]The correct answer is: **C. Serological testing for onchocerciasis**.

Onchocerciasis is a parasitic infection caused by the nematode Onchocerca volvulus. The infection is transmitted through the bite of infected black flies. The larvae of the parasite migrate to the skin and subcutaneous tissues, where they form nodules. The adult worms live in the nodules and produce microfilariae, which are released into the bloodstream. The microfilariae can be found in the skin, eyes, and lymph nodes.

The most common symptoms of onchocerciasis are skin rashes, itching, and nodules in the skin. The eye infection, known as onchocerciasis, can cause blindness.

The diagnosis of onchocerciasis is made by finding microfilariae in the skin or blood. Serological testing can also be used to diagnose the infection.

The treatment for onchocerciasis is with diethylcarbamazine. This medication kills the microfilariae in the blood and skin. However, it does not kill the adult worms. The adult worms eventually die, but this can take several years.

Prevention of onchocerciasis is by avoiding contact with black flies. This can be done by wearing long-sleeved shirts and pants, using insect repellent, and staying in screened-in areas.

In the case of the man in the question, he has a history of travel to Nigeria, where onchocerciasis is endemic. He also has a history of a similar sensation in his left eye that resolved spontaneously. He has a mild elevation in the relative eosinophil count. These findings are consistent with onchocerciasis. Therefore, the next step in his management should be serological testing for onchocerciasis.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Treatment with diethylcarbamazine would not be appropriate without a definitive diagnosis of onchocerciasis. Peripheral blood smear is not a sensitive or specific test for onchocerciasis. Serological testing is the preferred method for diagnosis. Exploration of the conjunctiva and removal of a foreign body would not be appropriate in this case because there is no evidence of a foreign body.

Explanation: The patient is a 13-year-old boy with a history of sports-related blunt trauma to the left eye. He is asymptomatic and has normal best-corrected visual acuity and intraocular pressures. Slitlamp examination reveals a round, pigmented lesion measuring 3 × 3 mm in basal dimension and with gravitational shifting within the anterior chamber fluid with patient head tilt. There is no corneal guttatae or edema. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography depicted the lesion in the anterior chamber angle abutting the corneal endothelium and resting on the iris stroma with no internal fluid level and no solid component. Ultrasound biomicroscopy confirmed the lesion to be cystic with a thickness of 1.6 mm. Dilated fundus examination revealed normal findings in both eyes.

The most likely diagnosis is a traumatic iris cyst. Traumatic iris cysts are benign, self-limited lesions that typically resolve within 6-12 months. They are thought to arise from disruption of the iris stroma and iris vessels, with subsequent accumulation of fluid in the sub-iris space.

In the absence of any symptoms or signs of complications, such as glaucoma or secondary infection, observation is the most appropriate management of traumatic iris cysts. The cyst will typically resolve spontaneously within 6-12 months. If the cyst persists or enlarges, or if the patient develops any symptoms or signs of complications, then further management, such as fine-needle aspiration biopsy or cyst drainage, may be necessary.

A: Fine-needle aspiration biopsy with cytology and cytogenetics is not necessary in the absence of any symptoms or signs of malignancy. Traumatic iris cysts are benign lesions and do not require tissue diagnosis.

B: Iodine 125 plaque radiotherapy is a treatment option for malignant iris tumors, but it is not indicated for traumatic iris cysts. Traumatic iris cysts are benign lesions and do not require treatment.

C: Observe with no additional testing or intervention is the most appropriate management of traumatic iris cysts in the absence of any symptoms or signs of complications. The cyst will typically resolve spontaneously within 6-12 months.

D: Cyst paracentesis with complete drainage is not necessary in the absence of any symptoms or signs of complications. Traumatic iris cysts are benign lesions and do not require drainage.

Blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome (BRBNS) is a rare, inherited disorder characterized by the presence of multiple cutaneous vascular malformations (CVMs) and visceral CVMs. Cutaneous CVMs are typically present at birth or appear in early childhood. They are typically blue or purple papules or nodules that may be located on any part of the body, but are most commonly found on the trunk and extremities. Visceral CVMs can occur in any organ, but are most commonly found in the gastrointestinal tract, liver, and spleen. BRBNS is caused by mutations in the KRIT1 gene, which codes for a protein involved in the regulation of blood vessel growth.

The patient in the case presented with multiple bluish, partially keratotic papules and nodules on the lower legs. These lesions are consistent with cutaneous CVMs. The patient also has a history of cerebral venous malformations, which are also consistent with BRBNS. The family history is also positive for BRBNS, with the patient's father and aunt both having the disorder. Mutational analysis revealed a heterozygous pathogenic KRIT1 variant, which confirms the diagnosis of BRBNS.

The other answer choices are incorrect. Familial cerebral cavernous malformations are a type of CVM that are not associated with cutaneous CVMs. Glomuvenous malformations are a type of CVM that are typically located in the hands and feet. Verrucous venous malformations are a type of CVM that are typically located on the genitals.

  1%|          | 17/1525 [03:56<5:30:02, 13.13s/it]The answer is **A: Whole-body positron emission tomography scan**.

A whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) scan is a medical imaging test that uses a radioactive tracer to create images of the body. The tracer is injected into the bloodstream and travels to the tumor, where it is absorbed. The PET scanner then detects the radiation from the tracer and creates an image of the tumor.

A PET scan is often used to diagnose cancer, to determine the extent of cancer, and to monitor the effectiveness of cancer treatment. In this case, the patient has a history of cutaneous basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, both of which are types of skin cancer. The patient also has a new, amelanotic fundus lesion in the left eye. Amelanotic fundus lesions are often caused by choroidal melanoma, which is a type of eye cancer.

A PET scan is the best test to diagnose choroidal melanoma. The PET scan can show the size and location of the tumor, and it can also show if the tumor has spread to other parts of the body. This information is important for making treatment decisions.

The other options are not as accurate as a PET scan for diagnosing choroidal melanoma. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy is a procedure in which a small needle is used to remove a sample of tissue from the tumor. This sample is then examined under a microscope to look for cancer cells. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy is not as accurate as a PET scan for diagnosing choroidal melanoma, and it can also spread cancer cells to other parts of the body.

Plaque radiotherapy is a type of radiation therapy that uses a small, radioactive pellet to deliver radiation to the tumor. Plaque radiotherapy is an effective treatment for choroidal melanoma, but it is not as accurate as a PET scan for diagnosing the cancer.

Observation is not an appropriate treatment for choroidal melanoma. Choroidal melanoma is a serious cancer that can spread to other parts of the body. It is important to diagnose and treat choroidal melanoma as soon as possible.

Explanation:

The patient in the case presented with multiple pruritic erythematous to violaceous papules and plaques localized to the left shin for more than 10 years. On close inspection, milia and a few erosions with partially detached epidermis were identified. There were no abnormalities of the mucous membranes, nails, hair, or teeth. No extracutaneous involvement was observed.

The clinical presentation and histopathologic findings are consistent with a diagnosis of pretibial pruritic papular dermatitis (PPPD). PPPD is a chronic, pruritic skin disorder that typically affects women in their 30s to 50s. It is characterized by the development of multiple, small, erythematous papules and plaques on the pretibial area (shins). The lesions are often pruritic and may be associated with milia (small, white cysts) and erosions. The cause of PPPD is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder. There is no cure for PPPD, but treatment options include topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and phototherapy.

The other possible diagnoses are not as likely in this case. Hypertrophic lichen planus (HLP) is a chronic, pruritic skin disorder that typically affects the hands, feet, and genitals. It is characterized by the development of thick, warty plaques. Epidermolysis bullosa pruriginosa (EBP) is a rare, chronic, pruritic skin disorder that is characterized by the development of blisters and erosions on the skin. Lichen amyloidosis (LA) is a chronic, pruritic skin disorder that is characterized by the development of small, brown papules on the skin.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for the patient in the case is pretibial pruritic papular dermatitis (PPPD).

Explanation:
The patient's history and examination findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of infectious neuroretinitis. This is a condition in which the optic nerve and retina become inflamed due to an infection. The most common cause of infectious neuroretinitis in children is Toxoplasma gondii, an infection that is usually acquired from contact with cat feces. Other possible causes include viral infections, such as herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, and cytomegalovirus, and bacterial infections, such as syphilis and Lyme disease.

The initial treatment for infectious neuroretinitis is usually systemic corticosteroids to reduce inflammation. If the infection is caused by a specific organism, such as Toxoplasma gondii, then specific treatment with an antiparasitic medication may also be necessary.

The other options are not as likely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms. A brain tumor would not typically cause optic disc edema and macular star, and it is unlikely to present with a history of mild fever and flulike symptoms. Checking blood pressure is important in general, but it is not likely to be the cause of the patient's vision loss.

Explanation:
Rhabdomyoma is the most common mesenchymal tumor of the head and neck in children. It is usually a benign tumor that presents as a small, asymptomatic mass. On imaging, rhabdomyoma is typically a well-circumscribed, solid mass that is hypointense on T2-weighted images and hyperintense on T1-weighted images with homogeneous contrast enhancement. The clinical presentation, imaging findings, and lack of other masses in the patient's head and neck make rhabdomyoma the most likely diagnosis in this case.

Hemangioma is a benign vascular tumor that can occur in any part of the body, including the head and neck. It is the most common tumor of infancy and childhood. Hemangiomas are typically present at birth or develop in the first few months of life. They grow rapidly during the first year of life and then gradually involute over the next few years. Hemangiomas are usually asymptomatic, but they can cause problems if they are large or located in a sensitive area. On imaging, hemangiomas are typically well-circumscribed, lobulated masses that are hyperintense on T1-weighted images and T2-weighted images. They may also have a characteristic "salt and pepper" appearance on T2-weighted images.

Rhabdomyosarcoma is a malignant soft tissue tumor that can occur in any part of the body, including the head and neck. It is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children. Rhabdomyosarcoma is a highly aggressive tumor that can metastasize to other parts of the body. On imaging, rhabdomyosarcoma is typically a large, irregular mass that is hypointense on T2-weighted images and hyperintense on T1-weighted images with heterogeneous contrast enhancement. The clinical presentation, imaging findings, and presence of other masses in the patient's head and neck make rhabdomyosarcoma a less likely diagnosis in this case.

Teratoma is a rare, complex, congenital tumor that can occur in any part of the body, including the head and neck. It is composed of a mixture of tissues from different germ cell layers. Teratomas can be benign or malignant. On imaging, teratomas are typically large, complex masses that contain a variety of tissues, including bone, teeth, hair, and fat. The clinical presentation, imaging findings, and absence of other masses in the patient's head and neck make teratoma a less likely diagnosis in this case.

The patient has a history of delayed wound healing, and the rash and poor wound healing after mastectomy are concerning for an underlying medical condition. A skin biopsy is the most definitive way to diagnose the cause of the rash and poor wound healing.

Acyclovir is an antiviral medication that is used to treat herpes simplex virus (HSV) infections. It is not indicated for the treatment of rash and poor wound healing after mastectomy.

Topical steroids can be used to treat a variety of skin conditions, but they are not indicated for the treatment of rash and poor wound healing after mastectomy.

Doxycycline is an antibiotic that is used to treat bacterial infections. It is not indicated for the treatment of rash and poor wound healing after mastectomy.

  1%|▏         | 22/1525 [04:58<4:57:35, 11.88s/it]The correct answer is: A. Disseminated fusariosis.

Explanation:
The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a history of multiple myeloma complicated by therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia. She was admitted for myeloablative conditioning in preparation for allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant. Her course was complicated by severe mucositis, acute kidney injury, and neutropenic fever. During her admission, the patient also developed painful necrotic skin lesions, a nonproductive cough, and altered mental status.

The physical examination findings demonstrated dusky, purpuric, and pink papulonodules, some with overlying eschar, scattered on the scalp, neck, trunk, and extremities. Laboratory study results revealed a white blood cell count of 150/μL (reference range, 3500/μL to 10 500/μL), an absolute neutrophil count of 130/μL (reference range, 1500/μL to 7400/μL), and a platelet count of 19 ×103/μL (reference range, 150 ×103/μL to 400 ×103/μL). (To convert the white blood cell and neutrophil counts to cells ×109/L, multiply by 0.001; conversion of the platelet count to cells ×109/L is 1:1.) Blood culture results were negative. The results of a computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain showed no acute intracranial hemorrhage, territorial infarction, or mass effect. The results of a CT scan of the chest demonstrated multifocal bilateral ground-glass patchy opacities, scattered solid bilateral pulmonary nodules, and a moderately sized pericardial effusion. A biopsy specimen from a skin nodule on the left lateral thigh was obtained for histopathologic examination and tissue culture, and wet mount preparation of a tissue culture colony was performed.

The histopathologic examination of the skin biopsy specimen showed a mixed pyogranulomatous and necrotizing inflammatory infiltrate with extensive vascular invasion. The organisms seen on the wet mount preparation of the tissue culture colony were consistent with Fusarium.

Disseminated fusariosis is a rare, but potentially fatal, fungal infection that can occur in immunocompromised patients. The most common predisposing factors for disseminated fusariosis are hematologic malignancies, solid organ transplantation, and prolonged use of corticosteroids. The most common clinical manifestations of disseminated fusariosis are fever, pulmonary infiltrates, and skin lesions. The diagnosis of disseminated fusariosis is made by isolation of Fusarium from blood, tissue, or respiratory specimens. The treatment of disseminated fusariosis is amphotericin B, which is often combined with other antifungal agents such as voriconazole or caspofungin.

The other options are incorrect because they are not the most likely diagnosis for a patient with a history of multiple myeloma complicated by therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia who presents with fever, pulmonary infiltrates, and skin lesions. Invasive aspergillosis is a more common fungal infection in immunocompromised patients than disseminated fusariosis, but it is less likely in this patient because she does not have any risk factors for invasive aspergillosis, such as prior exposure to Aspergillus or prolonged neutropenia. Pseudomonal ecthyma gangrenosum is a skin infection that is caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a bacterium that is commonly found in the environment. It is more common in patients with burns, trauma, or other skin injuries. Sweet syndrome is a rare, but potentially life-threatening, inflammatory disorder that is characterized by fever, rash, and neutrophilic leukocytosis. It is more common in women than men, and it is often associated with underlying malignancy or medications.

Explanation:

The patient is an elderly man with a history of primary salivary duct carcinoma of the hard palate who has been receiving treatment with oral bicalutamide and radiotherapy. He presents with a 3-month history of a violaceous plaque with blackish papules and nodules on his left cheek, neck, and chest. The lesion has been asymptomatic but is increasing in size, with progression from his face to anterior chest.

On clinical examination, a hemorrhagic and erythematous plaque with multiple purpuric-to-blackish infiltrative papules and nodules extending from cheek, lateral neck, to the interclavicular area was found. An incisional biopsy from the infiltrative nodule on cheek was performed and submitted for histopathologic analysis.

The histopathologic findings showed a poorly differentiated angiosarcoma with epithelioid morphology. The tumor cells were arranged in acini, cords, and sheets, and were positive for CD31 and CD34. The diagnosis of radiotherapy-induced epithelioid angiosarcoma was made.

Radiotherapy-induced epithelioid angiosarcoma is a rare and aggressive malignancy that occurs after radiation therapy for other cancers. The median age at diagnosis is 60 years, and the male to female ratio is 2:1. The most common sites of involvement are the head and neck, followed by the trunk and extremities. The initial presentation is usually a rapidly growing mass that is often painful. The tumor is highly vascular and may bleed spontaneously. The diagnosis is made by biopsy. The treatment is surgical resection, but the prognosis is poor with a median survival of 12 months.

The other options are incorrect because they are not associated with radiation therapy. Kaposi sarcoma is a vascular tumor that is associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Acquired angiokeratomas are benign vascular tumors that are associated with aging and chronic venous stasis. Carcinoma hemorrhagiectoides is a rare and aggressive carcinoma of the skin that is associated with sun exposure.

Explanation:

Bullous pilomatricoma is a rare, benign skin tumor that arises from the hair matrix. It is characterized by a cystic or multilocular tumor with a central keratinous core and a peripheral rim of basophilic cells. The tumor is most commonly seen in adults, but it can also occur in children. The most common presentation is a solitary, painless nodule on the face, neck, or upper extremities. The diagnosis is made by biopsy. Treatment is usually surgical excision.

The other options are incorrect because they are not consistent with the clinical presentation and histopathology of the case. Matrical carcinoma is a malignant tumor of the hair matrix. It is a rare tumor that occurs most commonly in adults. The most common presentation is a rapidly growing, painful nodule on the scalp. The diagnosis is made by biopsy. Treatment is usually surgical excision with radiation therapy. Panfolliculoma is a benign tumor that arises from the hair follicle. It is a rare tumor that occurs most commonly in adults. The most common presentation is a solitary, painless nodule on the face, neck, or upper extremities. The diagnosis is made by biopsy. Treatment is usually surgical excision. Trichodiscoma is a benign tumor that arises from the hair follicle. It is a rare tumor that occurs most commonly in adults. The most common presentation is a solitary, painless nodule on the face, neck, or upper extremities. The diagnosis is made by biopsy. Treatment is usually surgical excision.

The patient's presentation is consistent with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC), a genetic disorder characterized by hamartomas (benign tumors) in multiple organs, including the brain, eyes, skin, kidneys, and heart. Retinal hamartomas are the most common ocular manifestation of TSC, occurring in up to 80% of patients. They are usually asymptomatic but can cause vision loss if they grow large enough to affect the macula, the part of the retina responsible for central vision.

Brain tumors are also common in patients with TSC, occurring in up to 50% of patients. The most common type of brain tumor in TSC is a subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA), which is a slow-growing tumor that can cause seizures, hydrocephalus, and other neurological problems.

Given the patient's history and physical examination findings, it is most likely that she has TSC. The next step in her management should be to order brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to look for associated central nervous system tumors. If a SEGA is found, it can be treated with surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.

The other options are not as appropriate in this case. Option A, initiating anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment, is not indicated for retinal hamartomas. Option C, performing a hypercoagulable workup, is not necessary in the absence of any signs or symptoms of a hypercoagulable disorder. Option D, ordering echocardiogram and carotid ultrasonography, is not necessary in the absence of any signs or symptoms of heart disease.

  2%|▏         | 26/1525 [06:00<6:06:42, 14.68s/it]The correct answer is: A. Arrange a percutaneous lung tissue biopsy.

The patient in this case has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease and Raynaud disease, but no history of cigarette smoking. He presents with dysphagia, weight loss, a cough productive of yellow sputum, dyspnea on exertion, and fatigue. He has been treated for presumed pneumonia with 3 courses of azithromycin over the prior 3 months. He has no known ill contacts or recent travel outside the US.

On physical examination, the patient has a maculopapular rash over his neck and chest and bibasilar crackles on lung auscultation. Laboratory testing shows a white blood cell count of 14.3 × 103/μL, a creatine kinase level of 2060 U/L, an aldolase level of 18 U/L, a C-reactive protein level of 30 mg/L, and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 35 mm/h. Antinuclear antibody immunofluorescent assay findings are positive. Results from testing for HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C are negative. A barium swallow study shows no visualized aspiration. Endoscopy reveals clean-based esophageal and duodenal ulcers and nonspecific gastritis. Chest computed tomography (CT) shows bibasilar pulmonary consolidations and ground glass opacities.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes a variety of conditions, including connective tissue diseases, vasculitis, infection, and malignancy. The patient's history of dysphagia and weight loss raises the possibility of an underlying malignancy, such as esophageal cancer. However, the patient's age, lack of smoking history, and absence of known risk factors for esophageal cancer make this diagnosis less likely. The patient's pulmonary symptoms and imaging findings are more consistent with a diagnosis of connective tissue disease, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE is a multisystem autoimmune disease that can affect the skin, joints, kidneys, lungs, heart, and other organs. The patient's positive antinuclear antibody test is consistent with a diagnosis of SLE.

The next step in the management of this patient is to arrange for a percutaneous lung tissue biopsy. This procedure will allow for a definitive diagnosis of SLE and will help to determine the extent of the disease. The biopsy will also help to guide the patient's treatment. If the biopsy shows that the patient has SLE, he will likely be started on a course of immunosuppressive therapy, such as prednisone. Prednisone is a corticosteroid that helps to suppress the immune system and reduce inflammation.

The other options are not as appropriate in this case. Option B, checking an antisynthetase antibody panel, is not necessary at this time. The patient's positive antinuclear antibody test is already consistent with a diagnosis of SLE. Option C, performing a quadriceps muscle biopsy, is also not necessary at this time. The patient's muscle symptoms are likely secondary to his underlying SLE. Option D, prescribing 10 days of prednisone (60 mg daily), is premature at this time. The patient's treatment should be guided by the results of his lung biopsy.

Explanation:

The most likely diagnosis is schwannoma. Schwannomas are benign tumors that arise from Schwann cells, which are the cells that wrap around and insulate nerve fibers. They are the most common type of peripheral nerve tumor, and they can occur anywhere in the body. Schwannomas are typically slow-growing tumors that are usually asymptomatic. However, they can cause symptoms if they press on nearby structures. In the case of the patient in the question, the schwannoma is located in the left oropharynx and hypopharynx. This is a rare location for a schwannoma, but it is not impossible. The symptoms of the patient, including dysphagia and dyspnea, are consistent with a mass in this location. The CT scan findings also support the diagnosis of a schwannoma. The mass is well-circumscribed and has clear planes separating it from the spinal musculature and carotid sheath. This is characteristic of a schwannoma, which is a benign tumor that is not invasive. The other options are less likely diagnoses. Perineurioma is a rare tumor that arises from perineural cells, which are the cells that surround Schwann cells. Fibroblastic lipoblastoma is a benign tumor that arises from fat cells. Pediatric fibromyxoid soft tissue tumor is a rare tumor that arises from fibroblasts, which are the cells that produce collagen. All of these tumors are less common than schwannoma, and they are not typically located in the oropharynx and hypopharynx.

Explanation: The patient is presenting with a clinical picture consistent with Miller Fisher syndrome, a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by ataxia, areflexia, ophthalmoplegia, and facial nerve palsy. The most common cause of Miller Fisher syndrome is an antibody-mediated attack on the GQ1b ganglioside, which is present on the surface of nerve cells. Treatment with intravenous immune globulin (IVIg) has been shown to be effective in treating Miller Fisher syndrome, and it is the recommended treatment for this condition.

Repeat blood cultures and starting antibiotics would not be appropriate in this case because there is no evidence of infection. Repeating the lumbar puncture would not be helpful because the initial lumbar puncture was normal. Starting intravenous corticosteroids would not be appropriate because corticosteroids are not effective in treating Miller Fisher syndrome.

Explanation: The most likely diagnosis is squamous cell carcinoma. This is supported by the patient's history of a slowly growing, fungating mass on his left shoulder, which is typical of squamous cell carcinoma. The biopsy findings of sheets of highly pleomorphic atypical spindle and epithelial cells within the superficial and deep dermis, extending into the subcutaneous tissue, and with 18 mitoses/mm2 are also consistent with squamous cell carcinoma. The PET-CT scan findings of an intensely hypermetabolic left shoulder mass and multiple hypermetabolic enlarged left axillary lymph nodes are also consistent with squamous cell carcinoma. The brain MRI findings of no intracranial metastasis are also consistent with squamous cell carcinoma.

Basal cell carcinoma is less likely than squamous cell carcinoma because it is typically a slow-growing, non-invasive tumor that does not metastasize. Melanoma is also less likely than squamous cell carcinoma because it is typically a rapidly growing, invasive tumor that often metastasizes. Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare type of skin cancer that is most common in elderly people. It is often aggressive and can metastasize to distant organs. However, the patient in this case is only 46 years old, which makes Merkel cell carcinoma less likely.

The patient has a history of B-cell lymphoma and active renal cell carcinoma (RCC), receiving cabozantinib therapy. He developed worsening hazy vision in the right eye after recent outside retinal detachment (RD) repair of the left eye, with pars plana vitrectomy and gas. The patient noted blurry vision started around the time of cabozantinib therapy initiation. Cabozantinib therapy was discontinued for surgery and resumed 3 days later. The referring retina specialist noted vitritis and vasculitis intraoperatively, but the result of vitreous biopsy cytology was negative for malignant cells.

The patient's presentation is concerning for a side effect of cabozantinib therapy, known as posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES). PRES is a rare but serious neurological disorder that can occur in patients receiving certain medications, including cabozantinib. It is characterized by headache, seizures, confusion, and vision changes. PRES can be life-threatening, so it is important to recognize the signs and symptoms early and to treat it promptly.

The treatment for PRES is to stop the offending medication and to provide supportive care, such as intravenous fluids and medications to control blood pressure and seizures. In some cases, plasmapheresis may be necessary.

In the patient's case, the most likely cause of his worsening vision is PRES. The fact that his symptoms started around the time of cabozantinib therapy initiation, and that the vitreous biopsy cytology was negative for malignant cells, supports this diagnosis.

The appropriate management for this patient is to stop cabozantinib and admit him for intravenous solumedrol. Solumedrol is a corticosteroid that can help to reduce inflammation and protect the brain from further damage. The patient should also be monitored closely for signs of neurological deterioration.

The other options are not appropriate for this patient. Vitreous tap and inject intravitreal foscarnet, vancomycin, and ceftazidime are treatments for endophthalmitis, which is an infection of the eye. This patient does not have any signs or symptoms of endophthalmitis, so these treatments would not be helpful.

Stopping prednisone and proceeding with diagnostic vitrectomy would not be appropriate for this patient because the diagnosis is already known. The patient has PRES, and the treatment for PRES is to stop the offending medication and to provide supportive care.

Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits followed by lumbar puncture are tests that can be used to diagnose PRES. However, in this case, the diagnosis is already known, so these tests would not be necessary.

The patient's history and physical examination findings are consistent with avascular necrosis of the left humeral head. Avascular necrosis is a condition in which the blood supply to the bone is interrupted, resulting in death of the bone tissue. The most common cause of avascular necrosis is trauma, but it can also be caused by other conditions such as steroid use, alcoholism, and connective tissue disorders.

The radiographic findings of the patient's left shoulder are also consistent with avascular necrosis. The absence of the humeral head and the well-demarcated smooth osseous margin of the proximal humerus are classic findings of avascular necrosis.

The next step in the management of this patient is to obtain an orthopedic surgery consultation. The orthopedic surgeon will evaluate the patient and determine if he is a candidate for shoulder replacement surgery. Shoulder replacement surgery is the most effective treatment for avascular necrosis of the humeral head.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Obtaining an MRI of the left shoulder would not provide any additional information that would change the management of this patient. Ordering serum tumor marker testing is not necessary, as there is no evidence of malignancy in this patient. Performing an urgent left shoulder joint aspiration is not necessary, as the diagnosis of avascular necrosis is already clear.

Spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is a rare but serious cause of acute myocardial infarction (MI). It is more common in women, especially in the postpartum period. The most common presentation is with chest pain, shortness of breath, and ST-segment elevation on electrocardiogram. The diagnosis is made by coronary angiography, which shows a tear in the coronary artery wall.

The treatment of SCAD is usually with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). This involves inserting a balloon into the coronary artery and inflating it to widen the artery. In some cases, a stent may be inserted to keep the artery open. PCI is usually successful in relieving symptoms and preventing further MI.

Medical management is not usually recommended for SCAD. This is because medical therapy does not address the underlying cause of the dissection, which is a tear in the coronary artery wall. Medical therapy may be used to control symptoms, such as pain and blood pressure. However, it is not a substitute for PCI.

Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is not usually recommended for SCAD. This is because CABG does not address the underlying cause of the dissection, which is a tear in the coronary artery wall. CABG may be used to treat SCAD if PCI is not possible or if there are other factors that make PCI risky.

In conclusion, the correct answer is: C. Percutaneous coronary intervention. PCI is the most effective treatment for SCAD. Medical management and CABG are not usually recommended.

Explanation:

Histiocytoid Sweet syndrome is a rare, idiopathic, neutrophilic dermatosis characterized by fever, neutrophilia, and painful, erythematous, edematous annular plaques. It is most common in middle-aged women, but can occur in men and children. The cause of histiocytoid Sweet syndrome is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder.

The diagnosis of histiocytoid Sweet syndrome is made based on the clinical presentation and skin biopsy findings. Skin biopsy shows a perivascular infiltrate of neutrophils, histiocytes, and eosinophils. There is often no evidence of vasculitis.

Treatment of histiocytoid Sweet syndrome is with corticosteroids. Other medications that have been used include dapsone, colchicine, and hydroxychloroquine. In some cases, azathioprine or cyclophosphamide may be necessary.

The prognosis of histiocytoid Sweet syndrome is generally good. Most patients respond to treatment with corticosteroids. However, the disease can be recurrent.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not fit the patient's clinical presentation. Drug-induced SCLE is a type of lupus erythematosus that is caused by certain medications. It is characterized by skin lesions, fever, and joint pain. VEXAS syndrome is a rare, autoimmune disorder characterized by fever, rash, eye inflammation, and lymphadenopathy. Histiocytoid Sweet syndrome is a rare, idiopathic, neutrophilic dermatosis characterized by fever, neutrophilia, and painful, erythematous, edematous annular plaques. Halogenoderma is a skin condition that is caused by exposure to certain halogens, such as chlorine and bromine. It is characterized by a rash, itching, and burning.

  2%|▏         | 34/1525 [07:52<5:54:25, 14.26s/it]The correct answer is: **A. Pseudoxanthoma elasticum.**

Explanation:

The patient has a 20-year history of progressive skin laxity, which is a characteristic feature of pseudoxanthoma elasticum. The skin biopsy specimen shows excessive calcification of elastic fiber fragments scattered in the reticular dermis, which is also a characteristic finding of pseudoxanthoma elasticum. The patient also has a family history of the disease, as her younger sister has developed the same skin symptoms.

Inherited cutis laxa syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by generalized skin laxity, joint hypermobility, and organomegaly. The skin biopsy specimen in this case does not show the characteristic findings of inherited cutis laxa syndrome, which include fragmentation and loss of elastic fibers in the dermis.

Pseudoxanthoma elasticum–like disorder with coagulation deficiency is a rare disorder characterized by skin laxity, calcification of elastic fibers, and coagulation abnormalities. The patient in this case does not have any coagulation abnormalities, so this diagnosis is not likely.

Pseudoxanthoma elasticum/pseudoxanthoma elasticum–like overlap syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by features of both pseudoxanthoma elasticum and pseudoxanthoma elasticum–like disorder with coagulation deficiency. The patient in this case does not have any coagulation abnormalities, so this diagnosis is also not likely.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is pseudoxanthoma elasticum.

Explanation:
The patient's history of living in rural China and close contact with dogs, cattle, and sheep, as well as his clinical presentation of fever, productive cough, and lethargy, are all consistent with cystic echinococcosis. Serologic testing for E granulosus antibodies is the most sensitive and specific test for this diagnosis. A positive serologic test result would confirm the diagnosis of cystic echinococcosis and would guide treatment. Stool examination for E granulosus eggs is not a reliable test for this diagnosis, as it is often negative in patients with cystic echinococcosis. Lung biopsy and liver biopsy are both invasive procedures that are not necessary to make the diagnosis of cystic echinococcosis. Lung biopsy may be indicated if the patient has a ruptured cyst that is compressing the right main bronchus, but this is not the case in this patient. Liver biopsy may be indicated if the patient has a liver cyst that is causing symptoms, but this is not the case in this patient. Therefore, the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is to obtain serologic testing for E granulosus antibodies.

Explanation:

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with leprosy, a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. Leprosy is characterized by skin lesions, nerve damage, and muscle weakness. The gold standard for diagnosing leprosy is a skin biopsy with positive acid-fast bacilli (AFB) staining or PCR testing. The US National Hansen’s Disease Program is a specialized laboratory that offers PCR testing for leprosy. This test is more sensitive than AFB staining and can detect leprosy even in patients who have received treatment.

A. Incubating the skin biopsy specimen on chocolate agar is not necessary for the diagnosis of leprosy. This test is used to culture bacteria, but Mycobacterium leprae is difficult to culture.

B. Obtaining serologic testing for M leprae phenolic glycolipid 1 is not necessary for the diagnosis of leprosy. This test is not as sensitive as PCR testing and can be falsely positive in patients with other diseases.

D. Treating the patient with dapsone, rifampin, and clofazimine is not appropriate at this time. These medications are used to treat leprosy, but the patient has not yet been diagnosed with the disease. It is important to confirm the diagnosis before starting treatment to avoid unnecessary exposure to these medications.

The patient's presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of amyloidosis, a condition in which abnormal proteins build up in the body's tissues and organs. Amyloidosis can affect the heart, kidneys, liver, nervous system, and other organs. The most common type of amyloidosis is AL amyloidosis, which is caused by the production of abnormal light chains by plasma cells.

The patient's history of chest pain and shortness of breath with exertion, as well as the findings on electrocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, are consistent with a diagnosis of heart failure. The patient's history of toe numbness and unintended weight loss are also consistent with amyloidosis.

The bone scintigraphy scan demonstrates increased cardiac uptake, which is a characteristic finding of amyloidosis.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient should be to perform a bone marrow biopsy. This test will help to confirm the diagnosis of amyloidosis and determine the type of amyloid protein that is present. The results of the bone marrow biopsy will also help to guide treatment.

Genetic testing and random skin biopsies are not necessary in the evaluation of this patient. Genetic testing is not always helpful in the diagnosis of amyloidosis, as there are many different types of amyloidosis. Random skin biopsies are also not necessary, as they are not likely to provide any useful information.

24-hour urine testing for monoclonal proteins is not necessary in the evaluation of this patient. This test is used to screen for multiple myeloma, a type of cancer that can cause amyloidosis. However, the patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with multiple myeloma.

In conclusion, the next step in the evaluation of this patient should be to perform a bone marrow biopsy. This test will help to confirm the diagnosis of amyloidosis and determine the type of amyloid protein that is present. The results of the bone marrow biopsy will also help to guide treatment.

Explanation:

The correct answer is D. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) or digital subtraction angiography (DSA) is the best next step in the management of a 64-year-old woman with diminution of vision, progressive redness, and dull aching pain in the right eye for 8 months. The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of serous choroidal detachment. Serous choroidal detachment is a condition in which fluid collects between the choroid and sclera, the two layers of tissue that surround the retina. This can cause vision loss, redness, and pain.

MRI with MRA or DSA is the best imaging modality to evaluate for the cause of a serous choroidal detachment. MRI can provide detailed images of the eye and surrounding structures, while MRA can assess the blood vessels in the eye. DSA can provide even more detailed images of the blood vessels in the eye.

If MRI with MRA or DSA shows that the cause of the serous choroidal detachment is a blockage of the blood vessels in the eye, then the patient may need treatment with medications or surgery to improve blood flow to the eye. If the cause of the serous choroidal detachment is not a blockage of the blood vessels in the eye, then the patient may need treatment with medications to reduce the inflammation in the eye.

A, B, and C are incorrect because they are not the best next steps in the management of a 64-year-old woman with diminution of vision, progressive redness, and dull aching pain in the right eye for 8 months. Ultrasound biomicroscopy is a procedure that uses sound waves to create images of the eye. It is not the best next step in the management of this patient because it cannot provide the same level of detail as MRI with MRA or DSA. Uveitis workup and steroids are treatments for uveitis, an inflammation of the uvea, the middle layer of tissue that lines the eye. They are not the best next step in the management of this patient because her history and examination findings are not consistent with a diagnosis of uveitis. Thyroid profile is a test that measures the levels of thyroid hormones in the blood. It is not the best next step in the management of this patient because her history and examination findings are not consistent with a thyroid disorder.

Explanation:

The patient presented with a unilateral deepening of the anterior chamber associated with signs of anterior uveitis and posterior synechiae between the iris and the lens. In addition, fundus examination revealed an inferior retinal detachment without any associated visible tear. The patient's symptoms and findings are consistent with a diagnosis of pupillary block glaucoma. Pupillary block glaucoma is a type of glaucoma that occurs when the iris blocks the flow of aqueous humor from the posterior chamber to the anterior chamber. This can lead to a sudden increase in intraocular pressure and a decrease in visual acuity.

The treatment for pupillary block glaucoma is to create a new opening in the iris, called a peripheral iridotomy. This allows aqueous humor to flow from the posterior chamber to the anterior chamber, which relieves the pressure and improves vision.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Option B, full-thickness sclerectomy, is a surgical procedure that is used to treat chronic glaucoma. It is not indicated for the treatment of pupillary block glaucoma. Option C, intravenous corticosteroids, is a treatment that is used to reduce inflammation. It may be used in the treatment of pupillary block glaucoma, but it is not the first-line treatment. Option D, combined phacoemulsification-vitrectomy surgery, is a surgical procedure that is used to remove a cataract and repair a retinal detachment. It is not indicated for the treatment of pupillary block glaucoma.

Therefore, the correct answer is A. Perform peripheral iridotomy.

  3%|▎         | 40/1525 [09:13<5:46:10, 13.99s/it]The correct answer is: A. Immunomodulatory therapy with another course of oral steroids.

The patient's history of stage 3 cutaneous melanoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, as well as his recent treatment with nivolumab and obinutuzumab, raises the possibility of posterior uveitis secondary to reactivation of his leukemia. Posterior uveitis is a common complication of cancer immunotherapy, and it can occur in up to 30% of patients treated with these agents. The most common presentation of posterior uveitis secondary to cancer immunotherapy is a panuveitis with diffuse pigmentary abnormalities, which is consistent with the patient's presentation. Fluorescein angiography can show diffuse retinal pigment epithelium loss and late staining of the retinal lesions, which is also consistent with the patient's findings.

The treatment of posterior uveitis secondary to cancer immunotherapy is typically with immunomodulatory therapy, such as high-dose steroids. In some cases, other immunosuppressive agents, such as cyclophosphamide or azathioprine, may be necessary. In the patient's case, he had already received a course of oral steroids, but his visual acuity had worsened after the steroids were discontinued. Therefore, it is reasonable to recommend another course of oral steroids, as well as close monitoring of his visual acuity.

Pars plana vitrectomy for vitreous biopsy with or without chorioretinal biopsy for flow cytometry to assess for leukemic cells is not necessary in the patient's case. The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are all consistent with posterior uveitis secondary to reactivation of his leukemia. Therefore, there is no need to perform a vitreous biopsy or chorioretinal biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.

Intravitreal steroid injection is not a recommended treatment for posterior uveitis secondary to cancer immunotherapy. Intravitreal steroids can cause retinal toxicity, and they are not effective in treating this condition.

Observation is not an appropriate management option for the patient. The patient's visual acuity has already worsened, and there is a risk of further visual loss if the posterior uveitis is not treated. Therefore, it is important to treat the patient with immunomodulatory therapy to prevent further visual loss.

Explanation:
The patient's history and imaging findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of paraganglioma. Paragangliomas are rare, neuroendocrine tumors that arise from the paraganglia, which are collections of cells that are found throughout the body, including the head and neck. They are typically benign, but can be locally aggressive. The most common symptoms of paraganglioma are headache, facial pain, and hearing loss. On imaging, paragangliomas are typically well-circumscribed and heterogeneously enhancing. The treatment for paraganglioma is surgical resection.

Schwannomas are benign tumors that arise from Schwann cells, which are cells that myelinate nerve fibers. They are typically slow-growing and non-cancerous. The most common symptoms of schwannoma are pain, numbness, and weakness in the affected area. On imaging, schwannomas are typically well-circumscribed and hypointense on T1-weighted imaging and hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging. The treatment for schwannoma is surgical resection.

Venous malformations are abnormal collections of veins. They are typically benign and asymptomatic. However, they can sometimes cause symptoms such as pain, swelling, and bleeding. On imaging, venous malformations are typically well-circumscribed and hypointense on T1-weighted imaging and hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging. The treatment for venous malformations is typically not necessary, but they can be treated with surgery, embolization, or laser therapy.

Pleomorphic adenomas are benign tumors that arise from the salivary glands. They are the most common type of salivary gland tumor. The most common symptom of pleomorphic adenoma is a painless mass in the mouth. On imaging, pleomorphic adenomas are typically well-circumscribed and hypointense on T1-weighted imaging and hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging. The treatment for pleomorphic adenoma is surgical resection.

Explanation:
The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of recurrent high-grade serous cystadenocarcinoma of the ovary who developed left-sided facial weakness and swelling after cycle 4 of chemotherapy. Physical examination findings were consistent with left lower-motor-neuron type of facial nerve palsy. She was conscious and well oriented, with no other relevant clinical signs or focal neurological deficits. There was no history of prior COVID-19 infection. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was requested, with clinical suspicion of metastasis in view of mildly elevated CA125 levels.

The results of MRI of the brain did not reveal any neuroparenchymal or meningeal lesions. However, both maxillary sinuses showed mucosal thickening, which was intermediate to hypointense on T2-weighted imaging and hypointense on T1-weighted imaging with postcontrast enhancement. Computed tomography sections confirmed bony destruction with foci of remodeling involving the walls of the maxillary sinuses.

The findings on MRI and CT are consistent with perineural spread of malignancy. The most likely primary tumor in this case is a maxillary carcinoma. Maxillary carcinomas are the most common type of head and neck cancer, and they often spread to the facial nerve via perineural invasion. This can result in facial nerve palsy, which is the most common presenting symptom of maxillary carcinoma.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely. Schwannoma is a benign tumor of the Schwann cells that myelinate peripheral nerves. It is typically a solitary lesion that does not spread to other parts of the body. Invasive fungal sinusitis (mucormycosis) is a rare, life-threatening infection that is caused by fungi of the Mucorales order. It typically occurs in patients with weakened immune systems, such as those with diabetes or cancer. Metastases from ovarian primary are also possible, but they are less likely than perineural spread of a maxillary carcinoma.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis in this case is a maxillary carcinoma with perineural spread.

Explanation:

The patient is a 46-year-old man with a history of an asymptomatic lesion on the dorsal tongue. The lesion was discovered by his dentist and was biopsied at another institution. The biopsy results showed acellular, amorphous, and eosinophilic material arranged in lobules. This is consistent with a diagnosis of localized amyloidosis (amyloidoma).

Amyloidosis is a condition characterized by the deposition of amyloid, a proteinaceous substance, in various tissues and organs. Amyloidomas are localized deposits of amyloid that are typically found in the skin, tongue, and other soft tissues. They are usually asymptomatic and are often discovered incidentally. However, they can occasionally cause symptoms such as pain, swelling, and bleeding.

The diagnosis of amyloidosis is made based on a biopsy of the affected tissue. The biopsy specimen is stained with special stains, such as Congo red, that highlight the presence of amyloid. The treatment of amyloidosis depends on the underlying cause. In some cases, no treatment is necessary. However, in other cases, treatment may be necessary to remove the amyloid deposits or to treat the underlying condition that is causing the amyloidosis.

The differential diagnosis for a lesion on the dorsal tongue includes a variety of conditions, such as fibroma, granular cell tumor, and median rhomboid glossitis. However, the clinical presentation, biopsy findings, and lack of systemic symptoms in this patient are most consistent with a diagnosis of localized amyloidosis (amyloidoma).

Explanation:

The patient is an 80-year-old man with a history of atrial fibrillation, receiving anticoagulation medication, and heart failure. He presents with a 4-week history of progressive weakness and fatigue, with associated development of purple bruiselike lesions on his head. He denies any history of trauma, falls, or occlusive headgear use.

On physical examination, numerous nontender violaceous plaques are seen on the forehead and scalp of the patient. On full skin examination, nonspecific skin-colored plaques are noted on the chest, and a 1.8 × 2.5-cm erythematous plaque is noted on the left lower back. There is no appreciable lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly.

Peripheral blood test results reveal a hemoglobin level of 9.1 g/dL, a platelet count of 68 × 103/μL, a white blood cell count of 2800/μL, and an absolute neutrophil count of 1.0/μL. Lactate dehydrogenase level is 202 U/L.

A 4-mm punch biopsy was performed on the erythematous plaque on the left lower back. The histopathologic findings show a cellular infiltrate of basophilic blastoid cells with prominent nucleoli and a perivascular distribution. Immunohistochemical staining shows strong positivity for CD123, a marker of plasmacytoid dendritic cells.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes a number of hematologic and cutaneous disorders. The most likely diagnosis, based on the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and histopathologic findings, is blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN). BPDCN is a rare, aggressive neoplasm of plasmacytoid dendritic cells. It typically presents in older adults with fever, fatigue, weight loss, and skin lesions. The skin lesions are often violaceous or erythematous papules or plaques. Laboratory findings may include anemia, leukocytosis, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase. Histopathologic findings show a cellular infiltrate of basophilic blastoid cells with prominent nucleoli and a perivascular distribution. Immunohistochemical staining shows strong positivity for CD123.

The treatment of BPDCN is typically with chemotherapy. The prognosis for BPDCN is poor, with a median survival of approximately 1 year. However, there have been some recent advances in the treatment of this disease, and new therapies are being developed.

The other possible diagnoses in this case include:

* Metastatic renal cell carcinoma: This is a possible diagnosis, but it is less likely than BPDCN. The patient does not have any of the typical features of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, such as flank pain or hematuria. The skin lesions in this case are also not typical of metastatic renal cell carcinoma.
* Epithelioid angiosarcoma: This is a rare, aggressive cutaneous tumor. It typically presents in older adults with violaceous or erythematous plaques on the skin. The skin lesions in this case are not typical of epithelioid angiosarcoma.
* Myeloid leukemia cutis: This is a rare, aggressive cutaneous manifestation of myeloid leukemia. It typically presents in older adults with violaceous or erythematous plaques on the skin. The skin lesions in this case are not typical of myeloid leukemia cutis.

Explanation:
The patient's history of multiple myeloma, his presentation with fever, pancytopenia, and tender erythematous plaques on the neck and trunk, and the histopathological findings of an inflammatory infiltrate of predominantly mononuclear cells in the superficial and mid dermis with myeloperoxidase-positive cells are all consistent with a diagnosis of cutaneous involvement of multiple myeloma.

Erythema multiforme is a hypersensitivity reaction that can be caused by a variety of factors, including medications, infections, and vaccinations. It is characterized by the development of round or oval erythematous lesions that often have a target-like appearance. Histologically, erythema multiforme is characterized by a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate in the upper dermis.

Histiocytoid Sweet syndrome is a rare, idiopathic, neutrophilic dermatosis that is characterized by the development of tender, erythematous plaques or nodules on the face, neck, and upper extremities. Histologically, histiocytoid Sweet syndrome is characterized by a perivascular and interstitial infiltrate of neutrophils, histiocytes, and eosinophils.

Cutaneous cryptococcosis is a fungal infection that can occur in people with weakened immune systems. It is characterized by the development of papules, nodules, or ulcers on the skin. Histologically, cutaneous cryptococcosis is characterized by the presence of yeast cells and spores in the dermis.

  3%|▎         | 46/1525 [10:41<5:59:15, 14.57s/it]Answer: The diagnosis is Takayasu arteritis.

Explanation: Takayasu arteritis is a chronic vasculitis that affects large arteries, particularly the aorta and its branches. It is most common in young women of Asian descent. The symptoms of Takayasu arteritis can vary depending on the arteries involved. In the case presented, the patient had headache, seizures, and altered consciousness. These symptoms are consistent with posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), which is a neurological disorder that can occur in patients with severe hypertension. PRES is characterized by reversible vasogenic edema of the white matter of the brain. The diagnosis of PRES is made based on clinical features and imaging studies. In the case presented, the patient had a cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) that showed bilateral white matter hyperintensity that was more marked in the bilateral parieto-occipital region. This finding is consistent with PRES. In addition, the patient had a computed tomography angiography (CT) angiography that showed short segment (3 cm) and short circumferential thickening of the descending aorta with right renal artery narrowing. This finding is consistent with Takayasu arteritis.

Atherosclerotic disease is a condition in which the arteries become narrowed and hardened due to the buildup of plaque. Atherosclerotic disease can affect any artery in the body, but it is most common in the heart, brain, and legs. The symptoms of atherosclerotic disease can vary depending on the arteries involved. In the case presented, the patient had headache, seizures, and altered consciousness. These symptoms are not consistent with atherosclerotic disease.

Moyamoya disease is a rare cerebrovascular disorder characterized by progressive narrowing of the large arteries that supply blood to the brain. The symptoms of moyamoya disease usually begin in childhood or adolescence. The most common symptoms are headache, seizures, and stroke. In the case presented, the patient had headache, seizures, and altered consciousness. These symptoms are not consistent with moyamoya disease.

Fibromuscular dysplasia is a nonatherosclerotic disorder that affects the walls of medium-sized arteries. Fibromuscular dysplasia can cause narrowing, dilation, or aneurysms of the arteries. The symptoms of fibromuscular dysplasia can vary depending on the arteries involved. In the case presented, the patient had headache, seizures, and altered consciousness. These symptoms are not consistent with fibromuscular dysplasia.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in the case presented is Takayasu arteritis.

The patient has a diffuse cutaneous eruption with confluent salmon-colored plaques composed of folliculocentric scaly papules across his body with several patches of unaffected skin on his trunk. He also has waxy, exfoliative scale on the volar aspect of his hands and feet and thickened, onycholytic nails. Severe ectropion prevents complete eyelid closure. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of mycosis fungoides, a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

A skin biopsy is the most important diagnostic test for mycosis fungoides. The biopsy will show a characteristic infiltrate of atypical T cells in the skin. T-cell clonality studies can be performed on the biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of mycosis fungoides.

Myositis-specific autoantibody panels are not indicated in the diagnosis of mycosis fungoides. These panels are used to screen for autoimmune diseases that can affect the muscles, such as polymyositis and dermatomyositis.

Testing for anti–double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody is not indicated in the diagnosis of mycosis fungoides. This test is used to screen for systemic lupus erythematosus, an autoimmune disease that can affect many different organs, including the skin.

Testing for HLA-B27 is not indicated in the diagnosis of mycosis fungoides. This test is used to screen for ankylosing spondylitis, a type of inflammatory arthritis that affects the spine.

In conclusion, the correct answer is: B. Obtain skin biopsy with T-cell clonality studies.

The patient has black tongue discoloration, which is a common side effect of cefazolin. It is caused by the elongation of the filiform papillae on the tongue, which can trap food particles and bacteria. This can lead to discoloration and bad breath. However, black tongue discoloration is not harmful and usually resolves on its own within a few weeks.

In this case, the patient has no other symptoms and the black tongue discoloration is not severe. Therefore, the best course of action is to provide reassurance and prescribe oral care to help prevent further infection. This includes brushing the teeth twice a day, flossing once a day, and using a tongue scraper.

Measuring serum cortisol level, performing a tongue biopsy, and stopping cefazolin are not necessary in this case. Serum cortisol level is not routinely used to monitor patients taking cefazolin. A tongue biopsy is not necessary to diagnose black tongue discoloration. Stopping cefazolin is not necessary because black tongue discoloration is a common side effect of the medication that does not require treatment.

In conclusion, the best course of action for this patient is to provide reassurance and prescribe oral care.

A teratoma is a germ cell tumor that can contain tissues from all three germ layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm. Dermoid cysts are also germ cell tumors, but they typically only contain ectodermal and mesodermal tissues. Squamous papillomas are benign tumors that arise from the squamous epithelium. Hairy pharyngeal polyps are benign tumors that arise from the mucosa of the pharynx.

The patient in this case is a 7-year-old girl with a 18-month history of a left pharyngeal lesion. The lesion is described as being pedunculated, white, and rubbery. Histologic examination reveals both ectodermal and mesodermal components, including keratinizing squamous epithelium with Actinomyces colonization overlying pilosebaceous units including hair follicles, arrector pili muscles, and sebaceous glands. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of hairy pharyngeal polyp.

Teratomas are rare in children, and they are more common in the sacrococcygeal region than in the head and neck. Dermoid cysts are more common in the head and neck than teratomas, but they typically do not contain hair follicles or sebaceous glands. Squamous papillomas are typically small, sessile lesions that do not contain hair follicles or sebaceous glands.

Hairy pharyngeal polyps are more common in children than adults. They are typically asymptomatic, but they can cause dysphagia, odynophagia, and hoarseness. Treatment is typically surgical excision.

A 2.5-mm hypopyon in the right eye and a 2.7-mm hypopyon in the left eye are concerning for endophthalmitis, which is a serious infection of the eye that can lead to blindness. The patient's history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and recent chemotherapy make her at increased risk for endophthalmitis.

The first step in the management of endophthalmitis is to obtain a sample of the hypopyon for culture and sensitivity testing. This will allow the physician to choose the most appropriate antibiotics to treat the infection. The sample can be obtained through an anterior chamber paracentesis, which is a procedure in which a small incision is made in the front of the eye to allow fluid to be drained.

Once the culture results are available, the patient will be started on intravenous antibiotics. Intravitreal antibiotics may also be injected into the eye to provide direct treatment to the infection.

The patient will also need to have her visual acuity monitored closely. If the infection is not treated promptly, it can lead to permanent vision loss.

The other options are incorrect because they do not represent the standard of care for a patient with suspected endophthalmitis.

Option A: Observe, as this is expected inflammation after voretigene neparvovec gene therapy.

This option is incorrect because the patient's history and examination findings are concerning for endophthalmitis, not for inflammation after voretigene neparvovec gene therapy.

Option B: Perform pars plana vitrectomy.

This option is incorrect because pars plana vitrectomy is not the standard of care for a patient with suspected endophthalmitis. Pars plana vitrectomy is a surgical procedure that is used to remove vitreous humor from the eye. It is only used in cases of endophthalmitis that are unresponsive to medical treatment.

Option D: Await results from systemic laboratory tests and blood culture.

This option is incorrect because the patient's visual acuity is already decreased and she is at risk for permanent vision loss. The patient should be started on treatment for endophthalmitis as soon as possible, even before the results of the systemic laboratory tests and blood culture are available.

  3%|▎         | 51/1525 [11:48<5:31:21, 13.49s/it]The correct answer is: C. Order genetic workup.

Explanation:
The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of Joubert syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by developmental delay, hypotonia, ataxia, and nystagmus. Joubert syndrome is caused by mutations in several genes, including JBTS1, JBTS2, and JBSCR. Genetic testing is the most accurate way to diagnose Joubert syndrome. If the patient is found to have a mutation in one of these genes, she will be eligible for genetic counseling and other services to help her and her family manage the condition.

Treatment for Joubert syndrome is supportive and includes physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech therapy. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to correct eye problems or other structural abnormalities. There is no cure for Joubert syndrome, but early diagnosis and intervention can help to improve the quality of life for affected individuals.

The other options are incorrect because:

* Option A is incorrect because the patient's brain MRI scan was already reported as normal. There is no need to review the scan or order another one.
* Option B is incorrect because strabismus is not a common feature of Joubert syndrome. The patient's nystagmus is not due to strabismus, and strabismus surgery would not be helpful in this case.
* Option D is incorrect because clonazepam is not a treatment for Joubert syndrome. Clonazepam is a medication used to treat seizures, but it is not effective in treating the symptoms of Joubert syndrome.

Pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) is a rare, chronic, and painful skin disease characterized by the development of deep, necrotic ulcers. It is often associated with underlying systemic diseases, such as myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), inflammatory bowel disease, and rheumatoid arthritis.

The patient in this case has a history of MDS, which is a type of blood cancer that affects the bone marrow. MDS is associated with an increased risk of infection, and the patient in this case developed multiple cutaneous ulcers that were initially treated as shingles. However, the lesions did not improve with treatment, and the patient was eventually diagnosed with PG.

The diagnosis of PG is based on clinical findings, including the presence of deep, necrotic ulcers with undermined borders. Histopathologic examination of skin biopsy specimens can also be helpful in making the diagnosis, as it typically shows a dense dermal infiltrate with predominantly neutrophils.

There is no cure for PG, but treatment is aimed at controlling the symptoms and preventing further progression of the disease. Treatment options include topical and systemic antibiotics, as well as immunosuppressive agents.

The other possible diagnoses in this case are all incorrect. Leukemia cutis is a type of skin cancer that is characterized by the presence of malignant myeloid cells in the skin. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is a type of vasculitis that is characterized by inflammation and necrosis of small blood vessels. Lymphomatoid papulosis is a rare, chronic, and benign skin disease that is characterized by the development of multiple, self-healing papules.

In conclusion, the patient in this case has a diagnosis of PG. This is a rare, chronic, and painful skin disease that is often associated with underlying systemic diseases, such as MDS. The diagnosis is based on clinical findings and histopathologic examination of skin biopsy specimens. There is no cure for PG, but treatment is aimed at controlling the symptoms and preventing further progression of the disease.

The patient has a history of kidney disease and two kidney transplants. She is also taking tacrolimus, amlodipine, atorvastatin, ethambutol, rifampin, and clarithromycin. These medications can all cause visual changes. The patient also has a left relative afferent pupillary defect, which is a sign of optic nerve dysfunction. The optic discs are anomalous in appearance, with central excavation in the left eye greater than the right eye. This suggests that the patient may have optic nerve atrophy.

Cranial MRI is the best test to evaluate the optic nerves. It can detect optic nerve atrophy, as well as other causes of visual changes, such as tumors, demyelinating diseases, and infection. Genetic testing, vasculitis serological evaluation, and positron emission tomography (PET) are not as helpful in evaluating the optic nerves. Genetic testing is only useful if there is a family history of a genetic disorder that can cause optic nerve atrophy. Vasculitis serological evaluation is useful to detect inflammation of the blood vessels, but this is not a likely cause of the patient's visual changes. PET is useful to detect cancer and other metabolic disorders, but it is not as helpful in evaluating the optic nerves.

Therefore, the best next step is to order a cranial MRI.

Explanation:

The patient is a 74-year-old man with a history of multiple squamous cell carcinomas that were treated with Mohs micrographic surgery. He presents with a tender, enlarging scalp lesion of 6 months’ duration. Skin examination reveals a 5-mm bright pink, dome-shaped papule with overlying vessels located at the crown of the scalp. There was no purulent discharge or overlying skin changes. A shave skin biopsy was performed and submitted for histopathologic analysis.

The histopathologic findings show a dermal-based tumor composed of small, round to spindle-shaped cells arranged in a vague nodular configuration. The tumor cells are positive for smooth muscle actin. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of symplastic glomus tumor.

Symplastic glomus tumors are rare, benign tumors that arise from the glomus body, a small sensory organ located in the dermis. They are typically found on the hands and feet, but can also occur on other parts of the body, including the scalp. The most common presentation is a small, painful papule.

The diagnosis of symplastic glomus tumor is made on the basis of histopathologic findings. The tumor cells are typically positive for smooth muscle actin and negative for S-100 protein.

Symplastic glomus tumors are usually treated with surgical excision. The prognosis is excellent, with most patients experiencing no recurrence after treatment.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not fit the clinical presentation of the patient. Angioleiomyoma is a benign tumor of smooth muscle cells. It is typically found on the skin of the extremities, but can also occur on other parts of the body. The most common presentation is a small, painless papule. Solitary fibrous tumor is a rare, benign tumor that arises from the fibrous tissue of the body. It can occur in any part of the body, but is most common in the abdomen. The most common presentation is a mass that is often asymptomatic. Malignant myopericytoma is a rare, malignant tumor that arises from the pericytes, cells that surround blood vessels. It can occur in any part of the body, but is most common in the extremities. The most common presentation is a mass that is often painful.

Explanation:

The patient is an otherwise healthy female in her late 20s with a 2-year history of multiple, slowly growing, infiltrated erythematous-violaceous patches and plaques, with occasional slight pain extending from her left upper arm to the left side of her chest. No triggers, such as local infection, insect bite, or trauma, occurred before the appearance of the lesions. She denied fever, weight loss, or fatigue. Physical examination showed multiple firm, nonscaly, purple erythematous patches and plaques with irregular borders on her left axilla, medial upper arm, and lateral thoracic region. No extracutaneous involvement was observed. A skin biopsy specimen was obtained from the left side of her chest for histopathological examination.

The histopathological examination shows irregularly branched, thin-walled blood vessels dissecting through collagen bundles within the superficial to mid dermis. The endothelial cells are plump and positive for cluster of differentiation (CD) 31 (CD31).

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of microvenular hemangioma. Microvenular hemangiomas are benign vascular tumors that typically present as small, red or purple papules or nodules on the skin. They are most commonly seen in adults, and there is a female predominance. The exact cause of microvenular hemangiomas is unknown, but they are thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

Microvenular hemangiomas are typically asymptomatic, but they can sometimes cause pain, itching, or bleeding. They are usually not associated with any other medical problems. The treatment of microvenular hemangiomas is generally not necessary, but they can be treated with laser therapy or surgery if they are symptomatic or unsightly.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not fit the patient's presentation. Patch-stage Kaposi sarcoma is a type of cancer that is caused by the human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8). It is typically seen in people with AIDS or other immunosuppressive conditions. Interstitial granulomatous dermatitis is a chronic skin condition that is characterized by inflammation of the skin's dermis. Acquired progressive lymphangioma is a rare type of lymphangioma that typically presents as a soft, cystic mass on the skin. Microvenular hemangioma is the most likely diagnosis in this case.

  4%|▎         | 56/1525 [13:06<6:20:04, 15.52s/it]The correct answer is: **B. Discontinue amiodarone and administer a corticosteroid.**

Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic drug that is commonly used to treat arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia. It is a very effective drug, but it can also have serious side effects, including pulmonary toxicity. Pulmonary toxicity is a rare but serious side effect of amiodarone that can occur in up to 5% of patients. It is characterized by the development of diffuse alveolar damage, which can lead to respiratory failure.

The patient in this case has a number of risk factors for amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity, including:

* Older age
* Female gender
* History of lung disease
* Recent myocardial infarction
* Use of high-dose amiodarone

The patient's presentation is also consistent with amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity. He developed infiltrates on chest radiography after receiving amiodarone, and his pulmonary symptoms worsened despite adequate diuresis.

The best way to manage amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity is to discontinue the drug and administer a corticosteroid. Corticosteroids help to reduce inflammation and can improve lung function. In some cases, it may also be necessary to provide supportive care, such as oxygen therapy and mechanical ventilation.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Performing a lung biopsy is not necessary in this case because the patient's presentation is consistent with amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity. A lung biopsy would only be necessary if the diagnosis was uncertain.
* Option C: Performing bronchoalveolar lavage is not necessary in this case because the patient's presentation is consistent with amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity. Bronchoalveolar lavage would only be necessary if the diagnosis was uncertain or if there was a suspicion of infection.
* Option D: Checking amiodarone plasma level is not necessary in this case because the patient's presentation is consistent with amiodarone-induced pulmonary toxicity. The amiodarone plasma level would only be helpful if there was a suspicion of overdose or if the patient was not responding to treatment.

  4%|▎         | 57/1525 [13:22<6:22:46, 15.64s/it]The answer is: A. Implant a defibrillator.

The patient has a history of syncope and frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). She also has a 50% stenosis of the left circumflex artery. These findings are concerning for ventricular arrhythmias, which can be life-threatening. Implanting a defibrillator would provide her with protection against sudden cardiac death.

Provoked drug testing with procainamide is not indicated in this patient because she does not have a history of sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Nadolol is a beta-blocker that can be used to treat PVCs, but it is not as effective as a defibrillator in preventing sudden cardiac death. Ablation of PVCs is a procedure that can be used to destroy the cells in the heart that are responsible for the arrhythmias. However, it is not as effective as a defibrillator in preventing sudden cardiac death, and it is not recommended for patients with a history of syncope or other symptoms of ventricular arrhythmias.

Therefore, the best course of action for this patient is to implant a defibrillator. This will provide her with the best protection against sudden cardiac death.

The patient has a history of gallstones and presents with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension. On physical examination, her abdomen is distended, tympanic, and slightly tender to palpation diffusely. Blood testing shows a white blood cell count of 10 450/μL (84.1% neutrophils); C-reactive protein level, 9.5 mg/dL; potassium level, 3.0 mEq/L (reference, 3.6-5.2 mEq/L); and creatinine level, 5.57 mg/dL (429.39 μmol/L, up from a baseline level of 0.80 mg/dL [70.72 μmol/L]). Sodium and liver function values were normal.

In the emergency department, she received a 500-mL bolus of intravenous crystalloid fluid and 1 g of intravenous ceftriaxone. A nasogastric tube was placed and initially drained 300 mL of biliary fluid. A non–contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan was performed, which showed a thickened gallbladder with air and gallstones adherent to the duodenum, with a suspected fistula tract.

The patient's presentation and imaging findings are consistent with a diagnosis of gallstone ileus. Gallstone ileus is a rare but serious complication of gallstone disease, in which a gallstone migrates from the gallbladder and lodges in the small intestine, causing obstruction. The most common site of obstruction is the ileum, followed by the jejunum and duodenum.

The treatment for gallstone ileus is surgical intervention. The goal of surgery is to remove the gallstone and relieve the obstruction. In some cases, it may also be necessary to remove the gallbladder.

The patient in this case should be resuscitated with intravenous fluids and antibiotics. She should then be taken to the operating room for surgery. The type of surgery will depend on the location of the gallstone and the extent of the obstruction. In most cases, a laparoscopic approach can be used to remove the gallstone and relieve the obstruction.

After surgery, the patient will need to be monitored closely for signs of complications, such as infection, bleeding, and bowel obstruction. She will also need to make lifestyle changes to reduce her risk of developing gallstones again, such as losing weight, eating a healthy diet, and avoiding excessive alcohol consumption.

The other options are incorrect because they do not provide the best management for this patient. Option A, administering barium through the nasogastric tube to evaluate for bowel obstruction, is not necessary in this case because the CT scan already shows that the patient has a gallstone ileus. Option B, ordering magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), is also not necessary because the CT scan provides all the information that is needed to make a diagnosis and plan for treatment. Option C, performing an emergency explorative laparotomy, is a more invasive procedure than is necessary in this case. The patient is already stable and can be managed with conservative measures, such as intravenous fluids and antibiotics, followed by surgery.

The patient presented with abdominal pain, diarrhea, and a petechial rash. These are all symptoms of gastrointestinal infections. A PCR panel is a test that can identify multiple different pathogens in a single sample. This is a more sensitive and specific test than traditional stool cultures. In this case, the patient's blood cultures grew Klebsiella pneumoniae, which is a common cause of gastrointestinal infections. Therefore, it is likely that the patient's abdominal pain, diarrhea, and rash were caused by a gastrointestinal infection. A PCR panel would be the most appropriate test to identify the specific pathogen that caused the infection.

A: Check stool for ova and parasites is not the most appropriate test in this case because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a parasitic infection. Parasitic infections are more likely to cause chronic diarrhea, weight loss, and abdominal pain. The patient in this case has acute diarrhea, abdominal pain, and a rash. These symptoms are more consistent with a bacterial infection.

C: Order measurement of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) level is not the most appropriate test in this case because ANCA is an antibody that is associated with autoimmune diseases, such as vasculitis. The patient in this case does not have any symptoms of vasculitis.

D: Send blood for fungal culture is not the most appropriate test in this case because fungal infections are more likely to cause fever, chills, and night sweats. The patient in this case does not have any of these symptoms.

Explanation:

The patient in this case has a medical history of deceased donor kidney transplant, cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis, and CMV viremia with documented resistance to foscarnet and ganciclovir (UL97 and UL54 gene mutations). They presented with new-onset floaters in both eyes. The patient was taking systemic immunosuppression but recently stopped taking maribavir because of concerns about resistance and was transitioned to cidofovir and CMV immune globulin. On clinical examination, the visual acuity measured 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS. Motility, visual fields, and anterior segment examination were normal. Dilated fundus examination revealed tortuous vasculature, multiple cotton wool spots along the arcades and periphery, and granular, hypopigmented retinal lesions without hemorrhage in the macula and temporal periphery in both eyes (Figure 1A). Optical coherence tomography showed localized areas of full-thickness retinitis (Figure 1B). CMV titers indicated viremia at 2.24 million IU/mL. Despite the patient’s documented UL97 and UL54 mutations, a series of 5 biweekly intravitreal injections of foscarnet and ganciclovir were performed given their vision-threatening lesions. Retinal pathology failed to improve, and the patient eventually refused additional intravitreal therapy because of pain and transiently decreased vision after each injection.

The patient is at high risk for progression of CMV retinitis and loss of vision. The current standard of care for CMV retinitis in patients with documented resistance to foscarnet and ganciclovir is treatment with multivirus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). CTLs are a type of white blood cell that can kill virus-infected cells. In a clinical trial, CTL therapy was shown to be effective in reducing the risk of progression of CMV retinitis and improving visual acuity in patients with documented resistance to foscarnet and ganciclovir.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Observation with systemic cidofovir and CMV immune globulin is not likely to be effective in this patient because they have already failed to respond to these therapies. Continued foscarnet and ganciclovir intravitreal injections are not an option because the patient has already refused these injections due to pain and transiently decreased vision. Leflunomide is a medication that is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis. It is not approved for the treatment of CMV retinitis and is not likely to be effective in this patient.

Explanation:

The patient is a 76-year-old woman with a history of a palpable left axillary mass. She underwent a hysterectomy at the age of 36 and has been taking estradiol to control postmenopausal vasomotor symptoms for the past 20 years. Bilateral diagnostic mammography revealed a high-density irregular mass in the left axilla with no nodules, architectural distortions, or microcalcifications in the breasts. Ultrasonography of the left breast showed a 4.6-cm lobulated mixed cystic and solid left axillary mass. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging showed an enhancing 5.2-cm left axillary mass with no breast lesions. The biopsy examination indicated high-grade adenocarcinoma with papillary features (estrogen receptor– and progesterone receptor–positive, ERBB2 [formerly HER2]–negative, and a high Ki67 index). Positron emission tomography/computed tomography revealed only high uptake in the left axilla region. The patient was treated at an outside hospital with neoadjuvant dose-dense doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, followed by weekly paclitaxel for 10 weeks. She then transferred her care to our center for surgical management. We requested the pathology slides for review at our laboratory and additional immunostaining was performed, which revealed high-grade adenocarcinoma with tumor cells positive for PAX8 (Figure 1B), p53, and WT1 and negative for GATA3.

The differential diagnosis for a high-grade adenocarcinoma with papillary features includes papillary carcinoma of the thyroid, high-grade serous carcinoma of gynecological origin, and high-grade carcinoma of the breast with occult primary. Papillary carcinoma of the thyroid is a rare tumor that typically occurs in younger patients. It is characterized by the presence of papillary structures on histologic examination. High-grade serous carcinoma of gynecological origin is a type of ovarian cancer that is characterized by the presence of serous cells on histologic examination. High-grade carcinoma of the breast with occult primary is a type of breast cancer that does not have a visible primary tumor on imaging studies.

In this case, the patient is an older woman with a history of a hysterectomy. She has a high-grade adenocarcinoma with papillary features that is positive for PAX8, p53, and WT1. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of high-grade carcinoma of the breast with occult primary. The patient's tumor is also negative for GATA3, which is a marker that is typically expressed in papillary carcinoma of the thyroid. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is high-grade carcinoma of the breast with occult primary.

Explanation:

The patient is a 7-year-old boy with a slowly growing, asymptomatic lump on his left lower neck since birth. His parents denied any medical history of trauma, infection, or surgery. Physical examination showed a 1.3 × 0.7 × 0.6 cm, yellowish, hump-like mass with hairy surface and cartilage-like consistency on the anterior border of the lower third of the left sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM). No other anomalies were observed. Ultrasonography revealed a 1.2 × 1.0 × 0.9 cm, hypoechoic, avascular, bulging nodule with an anechoic tubular structure extending to the subcutaneous fat and reaching the surface of the muscular layer. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a protuberant nodule with diffuse, slight hyperintensity on T1WI; and 2 mild hyperintense foci surrounded by hypointense tissue on fat-suppressed T2WI. The neck mass was completely excised under general anesthesia in the department of pediatric surgery. Intraoperatively, the mass extended into the anteromedial fascia of the left SCM and did not involve the deeper neck structures. Postoperative histopathologic analysis showed normal-appearing epidermis, multiple pilosebaceous follicles, abundant adipose tissue, and 2 centrally circumscribed segments of cartilage in the subcutis. Van Gieson stain highlighted elastic fibers surrounding individual chondrocytes.

The differential diagnosis of a neck mass in a child includes a variety of congenital, inflammatory, and neoplastic lesions. Congenital lesions include branchial cleft cysts, dermoid cysts, and thyroglossal duct cysts. Inflammatory lesions include lymphadenitis, abscesses, and cellulitis. Neoplastic lesions include hemangiomas, lymphangiomas, and sarcomas.

The patient's history and physical examination findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of cervical chondrocutaneous branchial remnant. These lesions are rare, accounting for less than 1% of all neck masses. They are thought to arise from aberrant development of the branchial arches and pouches. The typical presentation is a small, asymptomatic mass in the anterior neck. The mass may be cystic or solid, and it may be associated with a sinus tract or fistula. Histopathologic examination shows a combination of cartilage, adipose tissue, and skin elements.

The treatment of cervical chondrocutaneous branchial remnants is surgical excision. The goal of surgery is to completely remove the lesion, including any associated sinus tracts or fistulas. The prognosis for patients with cervical chondrocutaneous branchial remnants is excellent. With complete surgical excision, the recurrence rate is very low.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Branchial cleft cysts are typically located in the lateral neck, and they do not contain cartilage.
* Epidermoid cysts are typically located in the head and neck region, and they do not contain cartilage.
* Hair follicle nevi are typically located on the skin, and they do not contain cartilage.

Explanation:

The patient is a 11-year-old girl with a slow-growing, painless, left-sided neck mass. The mass is firm, fixed, and well-circumscribed. On imaging, the mass is a well-circumscribed mass of mainly soft tissue density with contrast enhancement. The lesion was positive for USP6 locus rearrangement (17p13.2) on florescence in situ hybridization.

The differential diagnosis for a slow-growing, painless, left-sided neck mass in an 11-year-old girl includes soft tissue giant cell tumor, ossifying fibromyxoid tumor, soft tissue aneurysmal bone cyst, and soft tissue osteosarcoma.

Soft tissue giant cell tumor is a rare, benign tumor that typically occurs in adults. It is characterized by a proliferation of giant cells and spindle cells. The tumor is usually located in the extremities, but it can also occur in the head and neck region.

Ossifying fibromyxoid tumor is a rare, benign tumor that typically occurs in young adults. It is characterized by a proliferation of spindle cells, fibroblasts, and giant cells. The tumor is usually located in the extremities, but it can also occur in the head and neck region.

Soft tissue aneurysmal bone cyst is a rare, benign tumor that typically occurs in children and adolescents. It is characterized by a large, blood-filled cyst. The tumor is usually located in the extremities, but it can also occur in the head and neck region.

Soft tissue osteosarcoma is a rare, malignant tumor that typically occurs in adolescents and young adults. It is characterized by a proliferation of malignant mesenchymal cells. The tumor is usually located in the extremities, but it can also occur in the head and neck region.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is ossifying fibromyxoid tumor. This is based on the patient's age, the location of the mass, the imaging findings, and the positive USP6 locus rearrangement on florescence in situ hybridization.

Soft tissue giant cell tumor is less likely in this case because it is typically a tumor of adults. Soft tissue aneurysmal bone cyst is less likely in this case because it is typically a tumor of children and adolescents. Soft tissue osteosarcoma is less likely in this case because it is typically a malignant tumor.

Explanation: The patient has a pinpoint orifice on the glans penis, with peripheral telangiectasias and a linear bluish structure on dermoscopy. Ultrasonography revealed a hypoechoic focal zone on the right side of the glans, with multiple hyperechoic bilaminar structures. A biopsy was performed, which showed a vellus hair cyst.

Pilonidal sinus is a common condition that occurs when hair follicles become infected. It is characterized by a small opening in the skin, usually in the lower back, that discharges pus. Cutaneous larva migrans is a skin infection that is caused by the larvae of certain worms. It is characterized by a linear, burrowing rash. Median raphe cyst is a common condition that occurs when a cyst forms along the median raphe of the penis. It is usually asymptomatic and does not require treatment. Vellus hair cyst is a type of cyst that is formed by vellus hair follicles. It is usually small and asymptomatic, but it can sometimes become infected.

The patient's history and physical examination are most consistent with a diagnosis of vellus hair cyst. The pinpoint orifice on the glans penis, with peripheral telangiectasias and a linear bluish structure on dermoscopy, are all characteristic findings of vellus hair cyst. The ultrasonographic findings of a hypoechoic focal zone on the right side of the glans, with multiple hyperechoic bilaminar structures, are also consistent with a diagnosis of vellus hair cyst. The biopsy findings of a vellus hair cyst are diagnostic.

The other possible diagnoses are not as likely in this case. Pilonidal sinus is usually located in the lower back, not the glans penis. Cutaneous larva migrans is characterized by a linear, burrowing rash, which is not present in this case. Median raphe cyst is usually asymptomatic and does not require treatment.

  4%|▍         | 65/1525 [15:13<6:05:37, 15.03s/it]The correct answer is: B. Perform a skin biopsy for histopathology and direct immunofluorescence.

The patient has a history of diabetes and presents with blisters on the right lower extremity. The blisters are tense and have no surrounding erythema or edema. This is concerning for bullous diabetic dermopathy, which is a condition that occurs in patients with diabetes. Bullous diabetic dermopathy is characterized by the development of blisters on the lower extremities. The blisters are usually painless and resolve spontaneously within a few weeks. However, they can be a sign of underlying diabetic complications, such as neuropathy or vasculopathy.

To confirm the diagnosis of bullous diabetic dermopathy, a skin biopsy is necessary. The biopsy will show characteristic changes in the skin, including the presence of microangiopathy and fibrosis. The biopsy will also help to rule out other possible causes of the blisters, such as infection or vasculitis.

Treatment for bullous diabetic dermopathy is usually supportive. The blisters can be treated with topical steroids or dressings. If the blisters are painful, oral analgesics can be used. In some cases, oral prednisone may be necessary to control the inflammation.

The other options are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate management for bullous diabetic dermopathy. Option A (aspirate the bullae with a sterile needle and cover with a clean dressing) is not necessary because the blisters are usually painless and resolve spontaneously. Option C (start oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/d)) is not necessary because the blisters are usually not severe and oral prednisone can have serious side effects. Option D (treat with oral cephalexin for 7 days) is not necessary because the blisters are not caused by an infection.

The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of giant cell arteritis (GCA), a systemic vasculitis that typically affects the medium and large arteries. GCA can cause a variety of symptoms, including headache, scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, fever, and weight loss. Visual loss is a common complication of GCA, and it can be sudden and severe.

The gold standard for diagnosing GCA is a temporal artery biopsy. However, this procedure can be difficult and time-consuming, and it may not be available in all cases. In patients with a high clinical suspicion of GCA, a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits and sinuses can be a helpful diagnostic test. MRI can show inflammation of the temporal arteries, as well as other features that are consistent with GCA.

If GCA is diagnosed, treatment with high-dose corticosteroids is essential to prevent further vision loss and other complications. In some cases, patients may also need to be treated with other medications, such as cyclophosphamide or azathioprine.

B and C are incorrect because they are not the first-line treatments for GCA. High-dose corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for GCA. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are not indicated in the absence of infection.

D is incorrect because it is not necessary to consult a stroke specialist in the absence of evidence of stroke. The patient's history and examination findings are not consistent with a stroke.

  4%|▍         | 67/1525 [15:43<6:00:59, 14.86s/it]The answer is: **D. Orbital biopsy.**

The patient's clinical presentation, imaging findings, and treatment response are consistent with orbital myositis, a noninfectious inflammatory condition of the extraocular muscles. Orbital myositis is a rare condition, but it is more common in patients with underlying systemic diseases such as multiple myeloma. The most common symptoms of orbital myositis are pain, swelling, and redness of the eye. The patient may also experience double vision, headache, and fever.

The diagnosis of orbital myositis is made based on the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging findings. Imaging studies such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can help to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms.

The treatment of orbital myositis typically involves the use of corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are powerful anti-inflammatory drugs that can help to reduce the swelling and inflammation of the extraocular muscles. In some cases, the patient may also need to take other medications, such as immunosuppressants or pain relievers.

In the case of the patient described in the question, the patient's clinical presentation, imaging findings, and treatment response are all consistent with orbital myositis. The patient's symptoms have worsened despite treatment with antibiotics, suggesting that the patient's condition is not infectious. The patient's underlying systemic disease, multiple myeloma, increases the risk of developing orbital myositis. Therefore, the next best step in the patient's management is to perform an orbital biopsy. An orbital biopsy is a surgical procedure that involves taking a small sample of tissue from the orbit. The tissue sample can then be examined under a microscope to determine the cause of the patient's symptoms. In the case of orbital myositis, the biopsy specimen will typically show evidence of inflammation and muscle fiber necrosis.

The other possible answers are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Answer A: Start antifungal therapy. This is incorrect because the patient's clinical presentation, imaging findings, and treatment response are all consistent with orbital myositis, which is a noninfectious inflammatory condition.
* Answer B: Sinus biopsies. This is incorrect because the patient's imaging studies do not show evidence of sinusitis.
* Answer C: Start corticosteroids. This is incorrect because the patient has already been started on corticosteroids, but his symptoms have worsened.

Therefore, the next best step in the patient's management is to perform an orbital biopsy.

The patient's presentation is concerning for endophthalmitis, a serious infection of the eye that can be sight-threatening. The most common cause of endophthalmitis is bacteria, followed by fungi and viruses. The most common risk factors for endophthalmitis are recent intraocular surgery, trauma to the eye, and uveitis (inflammation of the iris, ciliary body, and choroid).

The patient in this case has several risk factors for endophthalmitis, including recent cataract surgery, angle closure glaucoma, and a low hemoglobin level. He also developed acute chest pain and respiratory insufficiency, which are non-specific symptoms that can be seen in patients with endophthalmitis.

The gold standard for diagnosing endophthalmitis is a vitreous tap, which involves removing a small sample of fluid from the vitreous humor, the clear jelly-like substance that fills the inside of the eye. The sample is then sent to the laboratory for analysis to identify the causative organism.

Once endophthalmitis is diagnosed, treatment is with intravenous antibiotics. The choice of antibiotics depends on the suspected organism. In most cases, a combination of antibiotics is used to cover a broad range of possible organisms.

In addition to antibiotics, the patient may also need to have their eye surgically drained. This is done to remove any pus or debris that may be present in the eye.

The prognosis for patients with endophthalmitis depends on the causative organism, the severity of the infection, and the patient's overall health. With prompt diagnosis and treatment, most patients will recover with good vision. However, some patients may experience permanent vision loss.

The other options are not appropriate in this case.

Option B, perform laser iridotomy, is not appropriate because the patient's presentation is not consistent with angle closure glaucoma. Laser iridotomy is a procedure that is used to create a small opening in the iris to allow fluid to flow out of the eye and lower the intraocular pressure. It is not effective in treating endophthalmitis.

Option C, observation, is not appropriate because the patient's presentation is concerning for endophthalmitis, which is a sight-threatening condition. The patient needs to be treated with antibiotics as soon as possible.

Option D, perform hemoglobin electrophoresis, is not appropriate because the patient's presentation is not consistent with a hematologic disorder. Hemoglobin electrophoresis is a test that is used to diagnose hematologic disorders, such as sickle cell anemia and thalassemia. It is not effective in diagnosing endophthalmitis.

Explanation:
The patient has a history of metastatic breast cancer and has received multiple lines of therapy, including capecitabine. Capecitabine is a chemotherapy drug that can cause a variety of skin reactions, including rashes, redness, and itching. The patient's rash is consistent with a medication hypersensitivity reaction, and the fact that it did not respond to treatment with topical clindamycin, oral solumedrol, or doxycycline further supports this diagnosis. Inflammation of actinic keratoses (A) is a precancerous skin condition that is typically seen in older adults with a history of sun exposure. Discoid lupus erythematosus (D) is an autoimmune disease that can cause a variety of skin lesions, including rashes, plaques, and ulcers. Both of these conditions are less likely than a medication hypersensitivity reaction in a patient with a history of metastatic breast cancer who has recently received capecitabine.

Granular cell tumors are the most common mesenchymal neoplasm of the larynx. They are benign tumors that arise from Schwann cells, which are the cells that myelinate nerves. Granular cell tumors are typically located in the larynx, but they can also occur in the skin, gastrointestinal tract, and other organs.

The most common symptom of a granular cell tumor is hoarseness. Other symptoms may include stridor, dyspnea, and a neck mass. Granular cell tumors are usually diagnosed with a biopsy. Treatment is typically surgical excision. The prognosis for patients with granular cell tumors is excellent.

The other options are incorrect because they are not the most common mesenchymal neoplasm of the larynx. Chondromas are benign tumors of cartilage. Glomus tumors are rare, benign tumors that arise from the glomus body, which is a small structure that regulates blood flow. Schwannomas are benign tumors of Schwann cells.

Explanation:

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH), previously known as histiocytosis X, is a rare, non-malignant, clonal disorder of dendritic cells. It can affect any organ system, but the most common sites are the bone, skin, and lymph nodes. The disease is characterized by the infiltration of Langerhans cells, a type of dendritic cell, into the affected tissues.

LCH is typically diagnosed in children under the age of 10, but it can occur in adults as well. The symptoms of LCH vary depending on the organs involved. In the case of the patient in the case study, the symptoms are consistent with LCH involving the temporal bone. These symptoms include unilateral hearing loss, a middle ear effusion, and a CSF leak.

The diagnosis of LCH is made based on a combination of clinical findings, imaging studies, and laboratory tests. Imaging studies, such as a CT scan or MRI, can show the characteristic bone lesions of LCH. Laboratory tests, such as a bone marrow biopsy, can confirm the diagnosis.

The treatment of LCH depends on the severity of the disease. In mild cases, treatment may not be necessary. In more severe cases, treatment may include surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy.

The prognosis for LCH is generally good. Most children with LCH go into remission after treatment. However, some children may have long-term complications, such as hearing loss or growth problems.

The other options are incorrect because they are not consistent with the clinical findings and imaging studies of the patient in the case study. Gorham-Stout disease is a rare, non-malignant disorder characterized by the progressive destruction of bone. Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a more likely diagnosis in a child with unilateral hearing loss, a middle ear effusion, and a CSF leak. Cholesteatoma is a benign tumor that can develop in the middle ear. Sarcoma is a type of cancer that can develop in any tissue of the body. It is not a likely diagnosis in a child with the symptoms described in the case study.

Explanation:

Hydroxyurea is a chemotherapy drug that is used to treat a variety of conditions, including essential thrombocytosis (ET). It is known to cause a number of side effects, including skin ulcerations. In this case, the patient had a history of ET and had been treated with hydroxyurea for 14 years. She had developed numerous, primarily photodistributed, crusted, and ulcerated plaques of the trunk and extremities. The ulcerations had slowly increased in number and size over several years and were quite painful. She did have a medical history of nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSCa), which had previously been treated surgically. Several tangential shave biopsies were performed to help clarify the patient’s diagnosis. The histopathologic findings were consistent with hydroxyurea-induced ulcerations.

The other options are incorrect because:

* B. Hydroxyurea-induced squamous dysplasia is a type of precancerous skin lesion that can develop in people who are treated with hydroxyurea. However, the patient in this case did not have any evidence of squamous dysplasia on her biopsy.
* C. Hydroxyurea-induced phototoxic eruption is a type of skin rash that can develop in people who are exposed to sunlight after taking hydroxyurea. However, the patient in this case did not have any evidence of a phototoxic eruption on her skin.

Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple soft tissue tumors. The tumors are typically painless and slow-growing, and they most commonly occur in the skin, muscles, and bones. In some cases, the tumors can also affect the internal organs.

The exact cause of juvenile hyaline fibromatosis is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a mutation in the gene encoding the protein COL1A1. This gene is responsible for the production of collagen, a protein that is essential for the structure of connective tissue. When the COL1A1 gene is mutated, it leads to the production of abnormal collagen, which can cause the development of tumors.

There is no cure for juvenile hyaline fibromatosis, but there are treatments that can help to manage the symptoms. These treatments may include surgery to remove the tumors, chemotherapy to shrink the tumors, and radiation therapy to kill the cancer cells.

In the case of the patient described in the question, the most likely diagnosis is juvenile hyaline fibromatosis. The patient has a long history of multiple hard nodules on the scalp, which is a characteristic feature of this condition. The nodules are also painless and slow-growing, which is consistent with juvenile hyaline fibromatosis. Additionally, the patient has a family history of the condition, which increases her risk of developing it.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely. Infantile myofibromatosis is a condition that typically affects infants and young children. It is characterized by the development of multiple soft tissue tumors in the skin, muscles, and bones. The tumors are typically painful and fast-growing, which is not consistent with the patient's presentation. Mafucci syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple osteochondromas, which are benign tumors that arise from the growth plates of bones. The tumors are typically painless and slow-growing, and they most commonly occur in the hands and feet. Lipoid proteinosis is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the accumulation of lipid-rich material in the skin, mucous membranes, and internal organs. The disorder is typically diagnosed in childhood, and it is characterized by the development of multiple skin lesions, which are typically yellow or orange in color.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for the patient described in the question is juvenile hyaline fibromatosis. The patient's history, physical examination, and family history are all consistent with this diagnosis. The other possible diagnoses are less likely.

Explanation:

The patient has recurrent torsade de pointes, a life-threatening arrhythmia. Torsade de pointes is often caused by a prolonged QT interval, which is a measure of the time between the start of the Q wave and the end of the T wave on an ECG. Metoprolol is a beta blocker, which can prolong the QT interval. Sotalol is another beta blocker that can prolong the QT interval. Amiodarone is an antiarrhythmic drug that can be used to treat torsade de pointes, but it can also prolong the QT interval. Intravenous magnesium is a treatment for torsade de pointes, but it is not effective in all cases. An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is a device that is implanted in the chest and can deliver an electrical shock to stop a life-threatening arrhythmia, such as torsade de pointes.

The patient has a history of cardiac arrest due to ventricular arrhythmias. She has also had three episodes of torsade de pointes while receiving metoprolol. These factors indicate that she is at high risk for recurrent torsade de pointes and sudden cardiac death. Therefore, the most appropriate management is to implant an ICD.

The other options are not as appropriate for this patient. Discontinuation of metoprolol may not prevent further episodes of torsade de pointes. Starting sotalol would be a risk, as it could further prolong the QT interval and increase the risk of torsade de pointes. Starting intravenous amiodarone would be a risk, as it could further prolong the QT interval and increase the risk of torsade de pointes. Intravenous magnesium is a treatment for torsade de pointes, but it is not effective in all cases.

The patient in this case is experiencing acute dyspnea and retrosternal chest pain after undergoing balloon mitral valvotomy (BMV). These symptoms are consistent with a cardiac tamponade, which is a life-threatening condition that occurs when blood accumulates in the pericardial sac, causing compression of the heart.

The first step in treating a cardiac tamponade is to relieve the pressure on the heart. This can be done by performing pericardiocentesis, a procedure in which a needle is inserted into the pericardial sac to drain the blood. However, pericardiocentesis is a risky procedure that can cause complications, such as infection or bleeding.

A more conservative approach is to administer 100% oxygen, intravenous fluid, and Trendelenburg position. These measures will help to increase the patient's blood pressure and cardiac output, which will help to relieve the pressure on the heart.

If the patient does not improve with these measures, then pericardiocentesis may be necessary. However, in most cases, 100% oxygen, intravenous fluid, and Trendelenburg position will be sufficient to treat the patient's condition.

The other options are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate treatment for a cardiac tamponade. Pericardiocentesis is a risky procedure that should only be used if the patient is not responding to other treatments. Intravenous thrombolysis is a treatment for a heart attack, not a cardiac tamponade. Catheter-directed thromboembolectomy is a treatment for a blood clot in the leg, not a cardiac tamponade.

The patient has 3 darkly pigmented corneal lesions, which are concerning for fungal infection. Fungal infections of the cornea can be sight-threatening, so it is important to make a diagnosis and start treatment as soon as possible. The gold standard for diagnosing fungal keratitis is to obtain a sample of aqueous humor (the fluid inside the eye) and perform a fungal polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. This test can identify the specific type of fungus causing the infection, which will help guide treatment.

Increasing the frequency of topical corticosteroids may help to reduce inflammation, but it will not treat the underlying infection. Referring the patient to an ocular oncologist is also not appropriate at this stage, as the patient does not have any signs or symptoms of cancer. Obtaining a vitreous biopsy for bacterial culture is not necessary, as the patient does not have any signs or symptoms of bacterial infection.

Therefore, the best course of action is to obtain aqueous fluid for fungal PCR. This will help to make a diagnosis and start treatment as soon as possible.

Explanation: The patient has a history of mycosis fungoides, a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. He has also undergone radiation therapy and a stem cell transplant. These factors place him at increased risk for developing angiosarcoma, a rare type of cancer that can occur in the skin, soft tissues, and liver. Angiosarcoma typically presents as a rapidly growing mass that bleeds easily. The patient's presentation is consistent with angiosarcoma, and the diagnosis is supported by the findings of his physical examination and biopsy. The other options are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's presentation. Atypical infection, nocardia, is a bacterial infection that can cause skin lesions, but it is not associated with chronic ulcerations or bleeding nodules. Opportunistic fungal infection is a fungal infection that occurs in people who are immunocompromised, such as those with cancer or who have undergone a stem cell transplant. It can cause skin lesions, but it is not associated with chronic ulcerations or bleeding nodules. Granulation tissue is a type of tissue that forms during the healing process.

IgG4-related disease is a systemic disorder characterized by the infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells and lymphocytes into various organs and tissues. It can affect the eyes, sinuses, lungs, kidneys, pancreas, and other organs. The most common symptoms of IgG4-related disease are orbital swelling, sinusitis, and dry eyes.

In this case, the patient has a history of chronic orbital swelling, which is a common symptom of IgG4-related disease. She also has bilateral sinusitis, which is another common finding in patients with IgG4-related disease. The patient's orbital biopsy showed nodular lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates without evidence of fungal infection or necrosis, which are characteristic findings of IgG4-related disease.

The other possible diagnoses are incorrect. Graves disease is a thyroid disorder that can cause eye problems, but it does not typically cause sinusitis. Invasive fungal sinusitis with orbital extension is a rare and serious infection that can cause orbital swelling and proptosis, but it is not typically associated with chronic orbital swelling or sinusitis. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem inflammatory disease that can affect the lungs, eyes, skin, and other organs. It can cause orbital swelling and proptosis, but it is not typically associated with sinusitis.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is IgG4-related disease.

The patient presented with redness and swelling of the tumor site 3 days after initiating neoadjuvant immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy. Four days after treatment, a white head formed overlying the tumor that erupted through the skin surface. Thin, cloudy discharge that was not foul-smelling drained from the tumor from posttreatment days 5 to 10, at which point the drainage stopped spontaneously. Throughout, the patient reported no pain and remained afebrile. Laboratory results on days 5, 9, and 14 demonstrated the absence of leukocytosis, and serial wound cultures failed to demonstrate pathogenic growth. No antibiotics were administered. The patient completed the neoadjuvant immunotherapy and underwent a margin-negative tumor resection without intraoperative or postoperative complications.

These findings are consistent with immunotherapy-related inflammation. Immune checkpoint blockade immunotherapy works by blocking the interaction between immune checkpoints and their ligands, which allows T cells to more effectively kill tumor cells. This can lead to a local inflammatory response at the tumor site, which can manifest as redness, swelling, and drainage. In this case, the patient's symptoms resolved spontaneously without the need for antibiotics, which further supports the diagnosis of immunotherapy-related inflammation.

The other options are incorrect. Infection and suppuration is characterized by fever, leukocytosis, and purulent drainage. Tumor progression would be expected to manifest as worsening of the patient's symptoms, such as increased redness, swelling, and drainage. An allergic reaction would be expected to cause symptoms such as itching, hives, and swelling.

Pigmented dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (Bednar tumor) is a rare, locally aggressive, benign neoplasm of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. It is characterized by a blue-black or purple papule or nodule, often with a raised, peau d'orange appearance. The tumor is most commonly seen in young adults, and is more common in women than men. The exact cause of pigmented dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is unknown, but it is thought to be a neoplasm of the dendritic cells of the skin.

The diagnosis of pigmented dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is made on clinical grounds, with confirmation by biopsy. The treatment of choice is surgical excision, with clear margins. Radiation therapy may be used in cases where complete excision is not possible. The prognosis for patients with pigmented dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is good, with most patients experiencing no recurrence after treatment.

The other options are incorrect because they are not associated with a blue-green plaque.

Explanation:
The patient in this case presented with a pruritic rash that developed 13 days after she underwent radiotherapy for endometrial cancer. The rash was initially on her legs but then spread to her feet, arms, hands, and trunk. She also had a burning sensation and occasional pain.

The patient's medical history was notable for endometrial adenocarcinoma status post hysterectomy and recent postoperative radiotherapy. She denied any new medications or exposure to chemotherapy, imaging with intravenous contrast, or recent travel.

On physical examination, the patient had numerous erythematous edematous coalescing papules and plaques on the upper and lower extremities and scattered erythematous papules and plaques on the back and buttocks. Some plaques were annular and polycyclic in configuration, with central hyperpigmentation. Her chest, abdomen, face, and oral mucosa were clear.

A complete blood cell count was notable for an eosinophilia of 11%, with an absolute cell count of 0.80 ×103/uL. Results from a comprehensive metabolic panel were normal. A biopsy was performed on her right thigh for histopathological examination.

The histopathological examination showed a moderately dense perivascular and interstitial infiltrate of mononuclear cells with innumerable eosinophils. This finding is consistent with a diagnosis of EPPER.

EPPER is a rare, self-limiting skin condition that occurs after radiotherapy. It is characterized by a pruritic rash with annular and polycyclic plaques. The rash is usually seen on the upper and lower extremities, but it can also occur on the trunk and face. The diagnosis of EPPER is made based on the clinical presentation and histopathological findings.

There is no specific treatment for EPPER. Treatment is aimed at relieving the symptoms, which can include oral antihistamines, topical steroids, and cool compresses. The rash usually resolves within a few weeks to months.

The other options are incorrect because they do not fit the clinical presentation of this patient.

He also experienced a recent episode of wide complex tachycardia that required cardioversion. Cardiac catheterization revealed patent coronary arteries, which means that the patient's arrhythmia is not due to coronary artery disease. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a dilated right ventricle with moderately reduced systolic function and transmural late gadolinium enhancement with akinesis and dyskinesis involving the right ventricular (RV) free wall and outflow tract extending to the left ventricular (LV) anterior, septal, and apical segments. These findings are consistent with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC), a genetic disorder that can cause ventricular tachycardia and sudden cardiac death.

The treatment for ARVC is implantation of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD). An ICD is a device that is implanted in the chest and can deliver an electric shock to terminate ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. This can prevent sudden cardiac death.

In this case, the patient has already had an episode of wide complex tachycardia that required cardioversion. He is also at high risk for future episodes of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Therefore, the best treatment for him is to have an ICD implanted.

Cardiac positron emission tomography (PET) is a scan that can be used to detect arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. However, it is not necessary to perform a PET scan in this case because the patient already has a diagnosis of ARVC based on his clinical history, ECG, and cardiac MRI findings.

A transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) is a test that uses sound waves to create images of the heart. It can be used to assess the function of the heart and to look for structural abnormalities. However, a TTE is not necessary to diagnose ARVC in this case because the patient already has a diagnosis based on his clinical history, ECG, and cardiac MRI findings.

An electrophysiology study (EPS) is a test that is used to assess the electrical activity of the heart. It can be used to diagnose arrhythmias and to guide treatment. However, an EPS is not necessary in this case because the patient already has a diagnosis of ARVC and is at high risk for future episodes of ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. The best treatment for him is to have an ICD implanted.

Explanation:

The patient in this case has a number of symptoms that are consistent with SAPHO syndrome, including:

* Severe neck pain
* Swelling and persistent dull pain of the upper anterior chest wall
* Pustules on the palms
* Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels
* Normal results on workup for rheumatic and infectious disease
* Abnormal enhancement of C1/C2 vertebrae with prevertebral and retrodental tissue as well as of the anterior vertebrae at C4/C5 with hyperostotic anterior osteophytes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

SAPHO syndrome is a rare, chronic inflammatory condition that can affect the skin, joints, bones, and other organs. It is most commonly diagnosed in young adults, and men are more likely to be affected than women. The exact cause of SAPHO syndrome is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune condition.

There is no cure for SAPHO syndrome, but treatment can help to manage the symptoms. Treatment typically includes a combination of medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, and antibiotics. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove inflamed or infected tissue.

The prognosis for patients with SAPHO syndrome varies depending on the severity of their symptoms. Most patients experience periods of remission and exacerbation of their symptoms. With treatment, most patients are able to live relatively normal lives.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Neurosyphilis is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) that can cause a variety of neurological problems, including meningitis, cranial nerve palsies, and dementia. The patient in this case does not have any symptoms of neurosyphilis, and the MRI findings are not consistent with this diagnosis.
* Metastatic tumor is the spread of cancer from one part of the body to another. The patient in this case does not have any symptoms of cancer, and the MRI findings are not consistent with this diagnosis.
* Rickettsial infection is a group of infections caused by bacteria of the genus Rickettsia. Rickettsial infections can cause a variety of symptoms, including fever, headache, rash, and muscle aches. The patient in this case does not have any symptoms of a rickettsial infection, and the MRI findings are not consistent with this diagnosis.

The patient presented with irregular gray-white ulcers with a surrounding erythema on the soft palate, uvula, and tonsils. These findings are consistent with **syphilis**, a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. Syphilis is a multistage disease, and the primary stage is characterized by the appearance of a single, painless ulcer, called a chancre, at the site of infection. The chancre typically heals within a few weeks, but the infection remains active and can progress to the secondary stage, which is characterized by a widespread rash, fever, and lymphadenopathy. The secondary stage of syphilis usually resolves on its own, but if left untreated, the infection can progress to the latent stage, which is characterized by the absence of symptoms. The latent stage of syphilis can last for years, but it can eventually progress to the tertiary stage, which is characterized by serious complications, such as heart disease, neurological problems, and blindness.

The diagnosis of syphilis is made based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. The most common laboratory test used to diagnose syphilis is the treponemal antibody test, which detects antibodies to T. pallidum. The treponemal antibody test is very sensitive and specific, and it can be used to diagnose syphilis in all stages of the disease.

The treatment for syphilis is penicillin. Penicillin is the only antibiotic that is effective against T. pallidum. The dose of penicillin and the length of treatment are determined by the stage of syphilis.

In the case of the patient in the question, the most appropriate next step is to obtain serologic test results for Treponema pallidum. The serologic test results will help to confirm the diagnosis of syphilis and will guide the treatment.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option B: Perform a biopsy of the gray-white plaque is incorrect because a biopsy is not necessary to diagnose syphilis. The diagnosis of syphilis can be made based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory tests.
* Option C: Prescribe oral amoxicillin is incorrect because amoxicillin is not effective against T. pallidum. The only antibiotic that is effective against T. pallidum is penicillin.
* Option D: Start topical nystatin is incorrect because nystatin is an antifungal medication. Syphilis is a bacterial infection, not a fungal infection.

The patient in the case report has an amelanotic choroidal lesion, which is a lesion that does not contain melanin. Amelanotic choroidal lesions can be caused by a variety of conditions, including melanoma, choroidal hemangioma, and choroidal metastasis. The most common cause of an amelanotic choroidal lesion in a patient with a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is melanoma.

The patient in the case report has several risk factors for melanoma, including a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a family history of cancer, and the presence of an amelanotic choroidal lesion. Based on these risk factors, the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is to perform a fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the choroidal lesion. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy is a minimally invasive procedure that can be used to obtain a tissue sample for diagnosis.

Rituximab and radiotherapy are not appropriate next steps in the management of this patient because they are not effective treatments for melanoma. Positron emission tomography scan is not a useful tool for diagnosing melanoma because it is not a sensitive or specific test for this condition. Plaque brachytherapy is a treatment option for melanoma, but it is not appropriate for the patient in this case because the lesion is located in the choroid, which is a deep layer of the eye.

Therefore, the correct answer is: A. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy.

The patient has a history of breast and kidney carcinomas, which are both known to metastasize to the eye. The amelanotic choroidal mass in the left eye is suspicious for metastatic disease. The next step in the evaluation of this patient should be to perform a fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the mass to obtain tissue for diagnosis. Cytology and cytogenetics can be used to determine the cell type of the tumor and to identify any genetic abnormalities that may be present. This information will help to guide treatment decisions.

Options B, C, and D are incorrect because they would not provide the information necessary to make an accurate diagnosis and to guide treatment decisions.

Option B, iodine 125 plaque radiotherapy, is a treatment option for choroidal tumors, but it would be premature to recommend this treatment without first obtaining a diagnosis.

Option C, intravitreal methotrexate, is a treatment option for choroidal tumors, but it is not a first-line treatment for metastatic disease.

Option D, observe with no additional testing or intervention, is not an appropriate management option for a patient with a suspicious choroidal mass. The patient needs to be evaluated to determine the cause of the mass and to receive appropriate treatment.

Cutaneous angiosarcoma is a rare and aggressive type of skin cancer that typically occurs in people over the age of 60. It is more common in men than in women, and it is most often found on the lower extremities. The cause of cutaneous angiosarcoma is unknown, but it is thought to be related to damage to the skin from ultraviolet radiation.

The initial symptoms of cutaneous angiosarcoma are often a small, red or purple spot on the skin. The spot may grow slowly over time, and it may become raised and ulcerated. In some cases, the tumor may bleed or ooze. If cutaneous angiosarcoma is not treated, it can spread to other parts of the body, including the lymph nodes, liver, and lungs.

The diagnosis of cutaneous angiosarcoma is made based on a biopsy of the skin lesion. The biopsy will show the presence of abnormal blood vessels in the skin. Treatment for cutaneous angiosarcoma depends on the stage of the cancer. In early-stage disease, the tumor may be removed surgically. In more advanced disease, chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be used.

The prognosis for cutaneous angiosarcoma is poor. The average survival time for people with the disease is about 2 years. However, with early diagnosis and treatment, some people with cutaneous angiosarcoma can survive for many years.

The other options are incorrect because they do not describe the patient's symptoms and findings.

Madelung disease, also known as benign symmetric lipomatosis, is a rare disorder characterized by the accumulation of excess fat in the neck, upper back, and shoulders. It is more common in men than in women, and typically occurs in people over the age of 50. The exact cause of Madelung disease is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

The symptoms of Madelung disease include a large, symmetrical mass in the neck, upper back, and shoulders. The mass is usually soft and compressible, and it may cause pain or discomfort. In some cases, the mass may interfere with breathing or swallowing.

There is no cure for Madelung disease, but there are treatments that can help to manage the symptoms. Treatment may include surgery to remove the excess fat, physical therapy to improve range of motion, and lifestyle changes such as weight loss and smoking cessation.

The other options are incorrect because they are not associated with the symptoms and presentation of Madelung disease. Liposarcoma is a type of cancer that starts in fat cells. Familial lipomatosis is a rare genetic disorder that causes the accumulation of excess fat in the body. Drug-induced lipomatosis is a rare side effect of certain medications, such as steroids.

  6%|▌         | 90/1525 [20:50<5:56:04, 14.89s/it]The correct answer is **A: Behcet disease**.

Behcet disease is a chronic, relapsing, multisystem autoimmune disorder characterized by recurrent oral and genital ulcers, skin lesions, uveitis, and arthritis. It is most common in the Mediterranean region, the Middle East, and Japan.

The diagnosis of Behcet disease is based on the presence of at least three of the following criteria:

* Recurrent oral ulcers
* Recurrent genital ulcers
* Eye lesions (uveitis, retinal vasculitis, etc.)
* Skin lesions (aphthous stomatitis, folliculitis, erythema nodosum, etc.)
* Articular lesions (arthritis, spondylitis, etc.)
* Vascular lesions (vasculitis, aneurysms, etc.)

The patient in the case presentation meets the criteria for Behcet disease. She has a history of recurrent oral and genital ulcers, as well as skin lesions (erythematous and edematous papules in the inframammary area). She also has a history of polyuria and polydipsia, which can be a sign of uveitis.

The differential diagnosis for Behcet disease includes other autoimmune diseases such as Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. However, the patient in the case presentation does not have any of the typical features of these diseases. For example, she does not have diarrhea, abdominal pain, or weight loss. She also does not have fever, rash, or joint pain.

The histopathological examination of the patient's skin biopsy specimen shows dense infiltration of the ulcer bed by atypical cells. These cells are large and have characteristic grooved vesicular nuclei and moderate amphophilic cytoplasm. This is consistent with the diagnosis of Behcet disease.

The treatment of Behcet disease is aimed at controlling the symptoms and preventing complications. Treatment options include topical steroids, oral steroids, immunosuppressive drugs, and biologics.

The prognosis for patients with Behcet disease is variable. Some patients have mild disease that is easily controlled with treatment. Others have severe disease that is refractory to treatment and can lead to serious complications such as blindness, arthritis, and vascular problems.

  6%|▌         | 91/1525 [21:05<5:53:47, 14.80s/it]Answer: A

Explanation:
The patient in this case has a history of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, permanent atrial fibrillation, and coronary artery bypass graft 10 years ago. He presents with recurrent presyncope and bradycardia. Review of prior physician encounters revealed reports of lightheadedness and electrocardiograms (ECGs) with atrial fibrillation with ventricular rates of 40 to 50 beats per minute. Current medications include carvedilol, 25 mg, twice daily and apixaban, 5 mg, twice daily. An ECG (Figure, A) showed atrial fibrillation with an irregular ventricular rate of around 60 beats per minute, right bundle branch block (RBBB), and left posterior fascicular block (LPFB).Telemetry revealed heart rates of 50 to 60 beats per minute, which did not change with activity. Findings of echocardiography were unremarkable. We reviewed a prior ECG (Figure, B).

The patient's symptoms and ECG findings are consistent with a diagnosis of sick sinus syndrome. Sick sinus syndrome is a condition in which the sinoatrial node, the natural pacemaker of the heart, does not function properly. This can lead to a slow heart rate, which can cause symptoms such as lightheadedness, dizziness, and fainting.

The next step in management of this patient is to implant a pacemaker. A pacemaker is a small device that is implanted in the chest and sends electrical impulses to the heart to keep it beating at a normal rate. Pacemaker implantation is a very safe and effective procedure, and it has been shown to improve symptoms and quality of life in patients with sick sinus syndrome.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Ambulatory ECG monitoring is not necessary, as the patient's symptoms are clearly related to his slow heart rate. Exercise treadmill testing is not necessary, as the patient's symptoms are not related to exercise. Electrophysiology study is not necessary, as the diagnosis of sick sinus syndrome is already established.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is most consistent with sporadic late-onset nemaline rod myopathy. This is a rare, inherited disorder characterized by the accumulation of nemaline rods, rod-shaped inclusions, in skeletal muscle fibers. The disorder is caused by mutations in genes encoding proteins involved in the assembly of myofilaments. Symptoms typically begin in adulthood and can vary in severity. They may include muscle weakness, fatigue, and cramps. In some cases, there may also be respiratory problems, swallowing difficulties, and vision problems. There is no cure for sporadic late-onset nemaline rod myopathy, but treatment can help to manage symptoms. This may include physical therapy, occupational therapy, and medications to improve muscle strength and endurance.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Late-onset Pompe disease (glycogen-storage disease type 2) is a rare, inherited disorder characterized by the accumulation of glycogen in skeletal muscle fibers. The disorder is caused by mutations in the GAA gene, which encodes the enzyme acid alpha-glucosidase. Symptoms typically begin in childhood and can vary in severity. They may include muscle weakness, fatigue, and respiratory problems. In some cases, there may also be heart problems, liver problems, and intellectual disability. There is no cure for late-onset Pompe disease, but treatment can help to manage symptoms. This may include enzyme replacement therapy, physical therapy, and occupational therapy.
* Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder characterized by the production of antibodies that attack the acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. This can lead to muscle weakness and fatigue, which can worsen with activity. There is no cure for myasthenia gravis, but treatment can help to manage symptoms. This may include medications to suppress the immune system, such as corticosteroids or immunosuppressants, and medications to improve neuromuscular transmission, such as pyridostigmine.
* Paraneoplastic myositis is a rare, autoimmune disorder that can occur as a paraneoplastic syndrome, meaning that it is associated with a cancer. The disorder is characterized by inflammation and muscle weakness. There is no cure for paraneoplastic myositis, but treatment can help to manage symptoms. This may include medications to suppress the immune system, such as corticosteroids or immunosuppressants.

Explanation:
The patient's home sleep test results showed an apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) of 15 events per hour. This is considered mild obstructive sleep apnea. The patient's symptoms of loud snoring, abrupt awakenings with a sensation of breathlessness, fatigue, and hypertension are consistent with obstructive sleep apnea. The patient's body mass index (BMI) of 51.3 is also a risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea.

The first-line treatment for obstructive sleep apnea is continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. CPAP therapy delivers a stream of pressurized air through a mask that is worn over the nose and mouth. The pressurized air helps to keep the airway open during sleep.

In this case, the patient's home sleep test results are suggestive of mild obstructive sleep apnea. The patient also has risk factors for obstructive sleep apnea, including a high BMI. The patient's symptoms are also consistent with obstructive sleep apnea. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to initiate CPAP therapy.

Options B and C are incorrect because they are not the first-line treatment for obstructive sleep apnea. Option D is incorrect because there is no need to repeat the home sleep apnea test. The patient's home sleep test results are already suggestive of mild obstructive sleep apnea.

The patient has a history of severe primary open-angle glaucoma in both eyes and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in response to topical corticosteroids. He also has mild chronic macular edema in both eyes after remote cataract surgery and vitrectomy with membrane peel in both eyes. Two years prior, he underwent Baerveldt tube shunt in his left eye, and his IOP since surgery had been 8 to 14 mm Hg. Ophthalmic medications on presentation were timolol eye drops twice daily, brinzolamide-brimonidine eye drops 3 times daily, bimatoprost eye drops every night at bedtime, bromfenac eye drops once daily, and fluorometholone eye drops twice daily in both eyes.

During his visit, the patient complained of severe physical exhaustion, syncopal episodes, dysphagia, and sinus congestion. On external examination, he had diffuse facial edema and erythema without proptosis. Slitlamp examination showed mild chemosis and hyperemia in both eyes and a patent Baerveldt tube ostium in the midanterior chamber with normal bleb morphology without a tense capsule. A 24-2 Humphrey visual field showed new glaucoma progression in the left eye.

The patient's symptoms and signs are concerning for systemic disease, such as an inflammatory disorder or malignancy. It is important to perform a systemic workup, including chest imaging, to rule out these possibilities. If a systemic disease is found, it may be the underlying cause of the patient's glaucoma progression. Treatment of the systemic disease may help to improve the patient's glaucoma control.

The other options are not as appropriate in this case. Option A, discontinuing fluorometholone eye drops, may not be effective in controlling the patient's IOP. Option C, adding netarsudil eye drops every night at bedtime in the left eye, may be helpful in controlling the patient's IOP, but it is important to first rule out a systemic cause of the patient's glaucoma progression. Option D, placing a second nonvalved tube in the left eye with adjuvant micropulse laser, is a surgical option that may be considered if the patient's IOP is not controlled with medical therapy. However, it is important to first rule out a systemic cause of the patient's glaucoma progression before considering surgery.

This will allow for the initiation of appropriate treatment, which may include surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.

Admitting the patient to the hospital for a course of intravenous antibiotics would be appropriate if the patient had an infection, but there is no evidence of infection in this case. Ordering a homovanillic acid and vanillylmandelic acid test would be appropriate if the patient was suspected of having a pheochromocytoma, but there is no evidence of a pheochromocytoma in this case.

Rosai-Dorfman disease is a rare, non-neoplastic, histiocytic disorder that can affect any age group, but most commonly occurs in children and young adults. It is characterized by a proliferation of benign-appearing histiocytes, which are cells that play a role in the body's immune system. The histiocytes in Rosai-Dorfman disease often contain lymphocytes within their cytoplasm, a phenomenon known as emperipolesis.

The most common presentation of Rosai-Dorfman disease is cervical lymphadenopathy, which is present in up to 90% of cases. Other common findings include fever, fatigue, rash, and bone pain. The disease can also affect the lungs, liver, spleen, and other organs.

The diagnosis of Rosai-Dorfman disease is made based on clinical findings and histopathologic examination of a biopsy specimen. The disease is typically treated with corticosteroids, which can lead to significant improvement in symptoms. However, there is no cure for Rosai-Dorfman disease, and the disease can recur in some patients.

The other options are incorrect because they are not characterized by a proliferation of benign-appearing histiocytes. Castleman disease is a rare, lymphoproliferative disorder that can affect any age group, but most commonly occurs in middle-aged adults. It is characterized by the proliferation of B cells and plasma cells in lymph nodes. Sarcoidosis is a chronic, granulomatous disorder that can affect any organ in the body, but most commonly affects the lungs.

Explanation:
Oral hairy leukoplakia (OHL) is a white, corrugated lesion on the tongue or buccal mucosa that is associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. It is most common in HIV-positive individuals, but can also occur in people who are not infected with HIV.

The clinical features of OHL include a white, corrugated lesion on the tongue or buccal mucosa. The lesions are usually asymptomatic, but can sometimes cause pain or discomfort. OHL is often diagnosed by visual inspection, but a biopsy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

The treatment of OHL is not always necessary, as the lesions are usually benign and self-limiting. However, if the lesions are causing symptoms or are cosmetically unacceptable, they can be treated with topical or oral medications.

The prognosis for OHL is good, with most patients experiencing resolution of the lesions within a few months. However, OHL is a marker for HIV infection, and people with OHL should be tested for HIV.

The other options are incorrect because:

* Multifocal squamous cell carcinoma in situ is a precancerous condition that can develop into squamous cell carcinoma. It is characterized by multiple, well-defined white or red lesions on the tongue or buccal mucosa.
* Secondary syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection that can cause a rash, fever, and lymphadenopathy. It can also cause lesions on the tongue, but these lesions are usually flat and red, not raised and white.
* Herpetic infection is a viral infection that can cause blisters on the lips, mouth, or genitals. It can also cause lesions on the tongue, but these lesions are usually small, painful, and vesicular, not raised and white.

Explanation:

OCT is a non-invasive imaging technique that uses light to create cross-sectional images of the retina. It is a very sensitive test that can be used to detect subtle changes in the retina, such as those seen in this case. OCT can also be used to monitor the progression of disease and to assess the response to treatment.

Genetic testing is not indicated in this case because there is no evidence of a genetic cause for the patient's visual symptoms. Electroretinogram (ERG) is a test that measures the electrical activity of the retina. It is a useful test for diagnosing retinal diseases, but it is not as sensitive as OCT for detecting subtle changes in the retina.

The hair loss is typically progressive and begins in childhood. The hair is often fine and sparse, and it may only grow to a certain length before falling out. The diagnosis is made based on the clinical presentation and a biopsy of the scalp. There is no cure for short anagen syndrome, but treatment may include hair transplantation and medications to stimulate hair growth.

The other options are incorrect because they do not describe the patient's presentation. Trichodental dysplasia is a rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormal hair and teeth. Hypotrichosis simplex of the scalp is a rare genetic disorder characterized by sparse hair on the scalp. Loose anagen syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by hair loss that is caused by the hair follicles prematurely entering the telogen phase.

In summary, the patient's presentation is most consistent with short anagen syndrome. Therefore, the answer is A.

  7%|▋         | 100/1525 [23:09<5:19:38, 13.46s/it]Answer: C. Eruptive pruritic papular porokeratosis

Explanation:

Eruptive pruritic papular porokeratosis (EPPP) is a rare, self-limiting, papulosquamous skin disorder characterized by the sudden eruption of numerous, intensely pruritic, annular papules. The lesions are typically found on the extremities, but can also occur on the trunk and face. EPPP is most commonly seen in adults, but can occur in children. The exact cause of EPPP is unknown, but it is thought to be a reaction to an infection or an autoimmune disorder.

The diagnosis of EPPP is made based on the clinical presentation and a skin biopsy. The biopsy typically shows a characteristic perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate and a band of parakeratosis at the dermoepidermal junction.

There is no specific treatment for EPPP. Treatment is aimed at relieving the itching and preventing secondary infection. Topical corticosteroids, oral antihistamines, and phototherapy can be used to treat the itching. Secondary infection can be treated with topical or oral antibiotics.

EPPP is a self-limiting condition, and the lesions typically resolve within a few months. However, in some cases, the lesions can persist for several years.

The following are the reasons why the other options are incorrect:

* Annular lichen planus is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease characterized by the formation of flat-topped, violaceous papules. The lesions are typically found on the wrists, hands, feet, and lower legs. Annular lichen planus is not typically pruritic.
* Perforating granuloma annulare is a rare, chronic skin disorder characterized by the formation of annular papules that have central areas of perforation. The lesions are typically found on the hands, feet, and lower legs. Perforating granuloma annulare is not typically pruritic.
* Atypical pityriasis rosea is a common, self-limiting skin disorder characterized by the formation of a herald patch, followed by a generalized eruption of scaly papules. The lesions are typically found on the trunk and proximal extremities. Atypical pityriasis rosea is not typically pruritic.

  7%|▋         | 101/1525 [23:26<5:39:38, 14.31s/it]The correct answer is: **C. Address all modifiable cardiovascular risk factors and initiate cascade screening and high-intensity statin therapy and aspirin, 81 mg, daily.**

This patient has a strong family history of premature cardiovascular disease, including a myocardial infarction in his father at age 39 years and angioplasty with multiple stents in his older brother at age 43 years. Additionally, multiple male cousins on his father’s side have coronary artery disease. These findings suggest that this patient is at increased risk for cardiovascular disease, even though he has no traditional risk factors such as smoking, hypertension, or diabetes.

One of the most important modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease is elevated lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)], which is a type of lipoprotein that carries cholesterol in the blood. This patient’s Lp(a) level is elevated at 136 nmol/L. Other modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular disease include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and obesity.

In addition to addressing all modifiable risk factors, this patient should also be started on high-intensity statin therapy and aspirin, 81 mg, daily. Statins are drugs that lower cholesterol levels, and aspirin is a blood thinner that can help to prevent blood clots.

PCSK9 inhibitors are a newer class of drugs that can lower Lp(a) levels. However, they are not currently recommended for routine use in patients with elevated Lp(a), as they are expensive and have not been shown to be more effective than statins and aspirin in preventing cardiovascular events.

Therefore, the most appropriate management strategy for this patient is to address all modifiable risk factors and initiate cascade screening and high-intensity statin therapy and aspirin, 81 mg, daily.

Explanation:

The patient in the case presented with a slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia, gaze-evoked horizontal nystagmus, ataxic dysarthria, tone normal in all 4 limbs but stretch reflexes absent and plantar fascia mute, limb power normal, ataxia on finger-to-nose and heel-knee-shin tests, chorea present in both legs, ankle inversion with bilateral hammertoes, electromyography revealing sensory neuronopathy, and diffuse cerebellar atrophy noted along with T2 hyperintensities in bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles, cerebellar white matter, pons, and bilateral thalamus on brain MRI.

Friedreich ataxia is a rare, inherited disorder that causes progressive damage to the nervous system. It is characterized by ataxia, weakness, and spasticity. The patient in the case does not have the characteristic skeletal abnormalities associated with Friedreich ataxia, such as pes cavus (high-arched feet) and scoliosis (curvature of the spine).

Fragile X–associated tremor/ataxia syndrome is a genetic disorder that causes tremor, ataxia, and other neurological problems. The patient in the case does not have the characteristic facial features associated with Fragile X–associated tremor/ataxia syndrome, such as a large head and prominent ears.

Niemann-Pick disease type C is a rare, inherited disorder that causes the accumulation of a fatty substance called sphingomyelin in the cells of the body. It is characterized by ataxia, seizures, and developmental delay. The patient in the case does not have the characteristic organomegaly (enlargement of the organs) associated with Niemann-Pick disease type C, such as hepatomegaly (enlargement of the liver) and splenomegaly (enlargement of the spleen).

Mitochondrial ataxia is a group of disorders that are caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA. It is characterized by ataxia, seizures, and other neurological problems. The patient in the case has the characteristic features of mitochondrial ataxia, such as the presence of T2 hyperintensities in bilateral middle cerebellar peduncles, cerebellar white matter, pons, and bilateral thalamus on brain MRI.

Explanation:

The patient's presentation is consistent with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection, which is a common cause of pneumonia in children. The characteristic features of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection include fever, cough, and non-specific respiratory symptoms. In some cases, the infection can also cause skin lesions, such as the vesiculobullous lesions that the patient has developed.

The pathergy test is a diagnostic test for Behçet disease, which is a rare autoimmune disorder that can cause a variety of symptoms, including skin lesions. However, the pathergy test is not specific for Behçet disease and can also be positive in other conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Therefore, the pathergy test is not a useful diagnostic test in this case.

An echocardiogram is a test that uses sound waves to create images of the heart. It is a useful test for diagnosing a variety of heart conditions, but it is not a useful test for diagnosing Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection.

Testing for monkeypox virus is only necessary if there is a suspicion that the patient has been exposed to monkeypox. In this case, there is no evidence that the patient has been exposed to monkeypox, so testing for monkeypox is not necessary.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is to obtain Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM and IgG levels. These tests will help to confirm the diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection and to guide the choice of treatment.

The patient has a 1-day history of severe abdominal pain and cloudy PD fluid. She inadvertently broke aseptic technique 7 days prior. On presentation, she is afebrile and has normal vital signs. Physical examination reveals diffuse abdominal tenderness. Cloudy fluid that was drained from her PD catheter was sent for laboratory analysis.

The most likely diagnosis is PD-associated peritonitis. The next step in management is to obtain peritoneal dialysis fluid culture results before starting antibiotics. This is because empirical antibiotics may not be effective against the specific organism causing the infection, and may lead to the development of resistant organisms. In addition, empirical antibiotics may cause adverse effects, such as diarrhea and Clostridium difficile infection.

Once the culture results are available, the antibiotic regimen can be tailored to the specific organism. In the meantime, the patient can be treated with supportive measures, such as intravenous fluids and analgesics.

A and B are incorrect because they recommend starting antibiotics before culture results are available. This is not recommended because it may lead to the development of resistant organisms.

D is incorrect because it does not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, which is PD-associated peritonitis.

The patient had undergone anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgery, which is a procedure that involves removing a herniated disc and fusing two vertebrae together. This procedure can damage the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which is a nerve that controls the movement of the vocal folds. Damage to this nerve can cause vocal fold paralysis.

In this case, the patient presented with symptoms of vocal fold paralysis five months after surgery. This is consistent with the delayed onset of iatrogenic bilateral vocal fold paralysis. The other possible diagnoses are not supported by the clinical evidence.

* Arnold-Chiari malformation is a congenital condition that is not associated with vocal fold paralysis.
* Spinal abscess causing laryngeal edema is a rare condition that is not typically seen in patients who have undergone anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgery.
* Idiopathic bilateral vocal fold paralysis is a rare condition that is not likely in this patient, given the history of anterior cervical discectomy and fusion surgery.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is delayed iatrogenic bilateral vocal fold paralysis.

The patient in this case has a small, stable, pigmented iris lesion. The lesion has been present for decades and has not changed in size or appearance. The patient has no other ocular or systemic symptoms. Based on this information, the most appropriate management is to observe the lesion for any changes.

Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is not necessary in this case because the lesion is small and stable. FNAB is typically used to diagnose lesions that are suspicious for malignancy or that are changing in size or appearance.

Plaque brachytherapy is a form of radiation therapy that is used to treat intraocular tumors. It is not appropriate for this patient because the lesion is small and stable. Plaque brachytherapy is typically used to treat larger tumors that are at risk of spreading to other parts of the eye or the body.

Iridectomy is a surgical procedure to remove a portion of the iris. It is not appropriate for this patient because the lesion is small and stable. Iridectomy is typically used to treat tumors that are blocking the flow of aqueous humor, causing glaucoma.

In conclusion, the most appropriate management for this patient is to observe the lesion for any changes.

Lymphomatoid granulomatosis (LG) is a rare, non-Hodgkin lymphoma that predominantly affects the lung, skin, and central nervous system. It is characterized by a proliferation of atypical lymphocytes and histiocytes, with infiltration of high endothelial venules. LG is often associated with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).

The patient in the case presented with a 3-month history of rapidly growing and itchy cutaneous nodules all over the body. He also had lymphadenopathy, anemia, and a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Laboratory tests showed atypical lymphocytes in the peripheral blood, an elevated CD4+/CD8+ lymphocyte ratio, and high loads of EBV DNA in the peripheral blood. A biopsy specimen from a skin nodule showed infiltration of atypical lymphocytes and histiocytes with proliferation of high endothelial venules. In situ hybridization was positive for EBV in the skin.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of LG. The other options are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation. Cutaneous sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect the skin, lungs, eyes, and other organs. It is not associated with EBV. Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm is a rare, aggressive type of lymphoma that predominantly affects the skin and bone marrow. It is not associated with EBV. Cutaneous angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma is a rare type of lymphoma that predominantly affects the skin. It is not associated with EBV.

Verrucous xanthoma is a rare, benign, cutaneous condition that is characterized by the presence of multiple, verrucous, yellow papules or plaques. It is most commonly seen in middle-aged and elderly men, and it is often associated with diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, and other systemic diseases. The lesions of verrucous xanthoma are thought to be caused by the deposition of lipid-rich foam cells in the papillary dermis.

The diagnosis of verrucous xanthoma is usually made based on the clinical presentation and the histopathologic findings. The histopathologic features of verrucous xanthoma include the presence of large, polygonal, foam cells in the papillary dermis. These foam cells are filled with lipid droplets, and they often have a Touton-like appearance.

The treatment of verrucous xanthoma is usually not necessary, as the lesions are benign and self-limited. However, in some cases, the lesions may be treated with surgical excision, cryotherapy, or laser therapy.

The other options are incorrect because they are not associated with the clinical presentation and the histopathologic findings of verrucous xanthoma.

* Colloid milium–classic adult type is a rare, benign, cutaneous condition that is characterized by the presence of multiple, small, white papules. It is most commonly seen in middle-aged and elderly women, and it is often associated with aging and sun exposure. The lesions of colloid milium–classic adult type are thought to be caused by the accumulation of desmosomes in the papillary dermis.
* Nodular amyloidosis is a rare, systemic, amyloidosis that is characterized by the deposition of amyloid protein in the skin, kidneys, heart, and other organs. It is most commonly seen in elderly people, and it is often associated with multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and other hematologic malignancies. The lesions of nodular amyloidosis are thought to be caused by the deposition of amyloid protein in the dermis and subcutis.
* Nodular colloid degeneration is a rare, benign, cutaneous condition that is characterized by the presence of multiple, small, white papules. It is most commonly seen in middle-aged and elderly people, and it is often associated with aging and sun exposure. The lesions of nodular colloid degeneration are thought to be caused by the accumulation of colloid bodies in the papillary dermis.

Explanation:
Chromoblastomycosis is a chronic, granulomatous fungal infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissues that is caused by dematiaceous fungi. The most common species involved are Fonsecaea pedrosoi, Phialophora verrucosa, and Cladosporium carrionii. The infection is acquired through traumatic implantation of the fungus into the skin, most often from contact with soil or wood. The initial lesion is usually a small papule or nodule that slowly enlarges and develops a verrucous or ulcerated surface. The lesions are often multiple and may be distributed in a linear or zosteriform pattern. The diagnosis is made by histopathologic examination of a biopsy specimen, which shows characteristic granulomas with pigmented fungal elements. Treatment is with antifungal therapy, such as itraconazole or terbinafine.

In the case presented, the patient is a man in his 70s who presented with a 6-month history of a rash on the left forearm. The rash gradually increased in severity and was associated with purulent discharge and crusting. The patient denied any history of injury or exposure to suspected pathogens prior to onset. The physical examination revealed large, firm, mildly swollen erythematous plaques on the back of the left forearm. The results of routine laboratory investigations were normal. A biopsy specimen was taken for pathological examination, which showed hyperkeratosis, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, and lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with neutrophils, plasma cells, and a small amount of multinucleated giant cells in the dermis. The findings on histopathologic examination are consistent with a diagnosis of chromoblastomycosis.

The other options are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation. Cutaneous cryptococcosis is a fungal infection of the skin that is caused by Cryptococcus neoformans. The infection is usually acquired through inhalation of the fungus, and it most commonly affects the lungs. The cutaneous lesions are usually small, papular, or nodular lesions that may ulcerate. Cutaneous protothecosis is a fungal infection of the skin that is caused by Prototheca wickerhamii. The infection is usually acquired through contact with soil or water, and it most commonly affects the hands and feet. The cutaneous lesions are usually small, papular, or nodular lesions that may ulcerate. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a parasitic infection of the skin that is caused by Leishmania species. The infection is usually acquired through the bite of an infected sandfly, and it most commonly affects the skin of the exposed areas of the body. The cutaneous lesions are usually small, papular, or nodular lesions that may ulcerate.

Explanation:

The patient in this case has a history of intermittent chest pain and diaphoresis, which is concerning for angina. The patient is also a smoker with a 20 pack-year history, which puts him at increased risk for coronary artery disease. The initial ECG shows biphasic T waves in leads V2 and V3, which can be a non-specific finding but may also be seen in patients with coronary artery disease. The elevated troponin T level is also concerning for acute coronary syndrome.

Given the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings, the most appropriate next step is to perform coronary angiography. This will allow for visualization of the coronary arteries and identification of any blockages that may be causing the patient's symptoms. If a blockage is found, it can be treated with angioplasty and stent placement.

Discharging the patient home with outpatient cardiology follow-up would be premature, as the patient's condition is not stable. Ordering a dobutamine stress echocardiogram or reordering troponin T measurement in 3 hours would not provide enough information to make a diagnosis or determine the best course of treatment.

The patient has a history of recurrent orbital hemorrhages, which is a rare and potentially serious condition. The first episode of hemorrhage was treated with systemic corticosteroids, which resulted in resolution of the proptosis and visual impairment. However, the patient subsequently experienced a second episode of hemorrhage, despite treatment with corticosteroids. This suggests that the patient may have an underlying condition that is predisposing them to orbital hemorrhages.

Additional imaging, including a computed tomography (CT) scan and positron emission tomography (PET) scan, can help to identify the underlying cause of the patient's hemorrhages. A CT scan can provide information about the size, shape, and location of the lesion, while a PET scan can help to determine whether the lesion is metabolically active. This information can help to guide further management of the patient's condition.

A transconjunctival orbital biopsy is not indicated in this case because it would not provide any additional information about the underlying cause of the patient's hemorrhages. A biopsy would only be indicated if there were a suspicion of malignancy.

Arteriography is not indicated in this case because it is not a sensitive or specific test for orbital vascular malformations. Arteriography would only be indicated if there were a strong clinical suspicion of an orbital vascular malformation.

Therefore, the correct answer is: C. Additional imaging, including a computed tomography and positron emission tomography scan.

The patient is a 72-year-old homeless man with a recurrent cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the right temple and brow. The tumor has invaded the right sphenoid wing, involved the lacrimal gland, and is abutting the lateral rectus. The patient is strongly against an orbital exenteration.

The goal of treatment in this case is to achieve local control of the tumor while preserving vision. Neoadjuvant cemiplimab immunotherapy (anti–PD-L1 antibody) is a promising new treatment for SCC that has shown efficacy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease. It is a monoclonal antibody that targets the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) protein, which is expressed on the surface of tumor cells. Cemiplimab works by blocking the interaction between PD-L1 and the programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) protein, which is expressed on the surface of T cells. This allows T cells to recognize and kill tumor cells.

In a phase 2 clinical trial of cemiplimab for patients with locally advanced or metastatic SCC, the objective response rate was 38%. The median progression-free survival was 10.9 months. The most common adverse events were fatigue, diarrhea, rash, and pruritus.

After neoadjuvant cemiplimab immunotherapy, the patient may be eligible for globe sparing orbitotomy and surgical excision of the mass. This is a surgical procedure to remove the tumor from the orbit while preserving the eye. The goal of this procedure is to achieve local control of the tumor while preserving vision.

Palliative radiotherapy is a treatment option for patients with locally advanced or metastatic SCC who are not candidates for surgery or other curative treatment. The goal of palliative radiotherapy is to relieve symptoms, such as pain, bleeding, and obstruction.

Platinum-based chemotherapy is a treatment option for patients with locally advanced or metastatic SCC who are not candidates for surgery or other curative treatment. The goal of platinum-based chemotherapy is to control the growth of the tumor and improve quality of life.

In this case, neoadjuvant cemiplimab immunotherapy followed by globe sparing orbitotomy and surgical excision of the mass is the best treatment option. This approach offers the best chance of achieving local control of the tumor while preserving vision.

The patient has a history of cutaneous nodular melanoma and has undergone treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) pembrolizumab. ICIs can cause a variety of side effects, including inflammation of the eye (uveitis). The patient's symptoms of decreased visual acuity and metamorphopsia are consistent with uveitis.

Uveitis is a common condition that can affect people of all ages. It is usually treated with topical and/or systemic steroids. In some cases, uveitis may lead to permanent vision loss. However, with early diagnosis and treatment, most people with uveitis can maintain good vision.

The patient in this case has a history of melanoma and is currently being treated with an ICI. These factors increase her risk of developing uveitis. However, the patient's symptoms are mild and there is no evidence of retinal detachment or other serious complications. Therefore, the best course of treatment is to provide reassurance and recommend close observation.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Intravitreal anti-VEGF injections are used to treat exudative age-related macular degeneration, not uveitis.
* Option C: Pars plana vitrectomy and excisional biopsy of the membrane are surgical procedures that are used to treat more serious conditions, such as retinal detachment.
* Option D: Topical and systemic steroids are used to treat uveitis, but they are not necessary in this case because the patient's symptoms are mild.

Explanation:
The patient has a history of chronic hepatitis B infection and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). She underwent surgical resection of a solitary HCC three years prior, and has been receiving expectant observation since then. One and a half years prior to the current presentation, she was diagnosed with multiple lung metastases and started treatment with nivolumab, an immunotherapy drug. She achieved a biochemical and radiographic complete response to treatment.

The patient's current presentation is consistent with immunotherapy-related gastritis. The symptoms of nausea, anorexia, and water brash are common in patients receiving immunotherapy, and the presence of diffuse inflammation and ulcerations on EGD is highly suggestive of the diagnosis. The biopsy findings of chronic and active mixed inflammatory infiltrate, including intraepithelial lymphocytosis, are also consistent with immunotherapy-related gastritis.

Portal hypertensive gastropathy is a condition that occurs in patients with portal hypertension, which is a high pressure in the portal vein. The portal vein carries blood from the intestines to the liver. In patients with portal hypertension, the pressure in the portal vein can cause the blood vessels in the stomach to become dilated and tortuous. This can lead to inflammation and ulceration of the stomach lining. However, the patient in this case does not have portal hypertension, so portal hypertensive gastropathy is not a likely diagnosis.

Infectious gastritis can be caused by a variety of bacteria, viruses, and parasites. The symptoms of infectious gastritis can vary depending on the specific cause. However, the patient in this case does not have any of the risk factors for infectious gastritis, such as travel to an area with a high prevalence of infectious diseases or recent contact with someone who is sick. Additionally, the biopsy findings are not consistent with any of the known infectious causes of gastritis.

Liver cancer progression is a possible diagnosis in this case, but it is less likely than immunotherapy-related gastritis. The patient's liver cancer was initially diagnosed three years ago, and she has been receiving expectant observation since then. There is no evidence of liver cancer progression on the current imaging studies. Additionally, the patient's symptoms are more consistent with immunotherapy-related gastritis than with liver cancer progression.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is immunotherapy-related gastritis.

Explanation:

The patient presented with left-sided hearing loss for 6 months without evident cause. Otoscopy revealed a yellow-whitish calcareous lobular mass located in the mesotympanum anterior to the malleus with an intact tympanic membrane. The lesion was hard and painful during palpation. Pure-tone audiometry results showed a left-sided mixed hearing loss with a pure tone average of 110 dB HL and bone conduction levels at approximately 60 dB HL. The tympanogram showed a normal A-type curve with a normal to low middle ear compliance of 0.5 mm on the left side. Computed tomography (CT) imaging of the middle ear showed a heterogeneous hyperdense round mass of 5.5 mm in the left middle ear with a close relation to the malleus, eardrum, and tegmen. There were no other abnormalities in the mastoid, ossicular chain, facial nerve canal, or surrounding blood vessels.

These findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of cholesteatoma. Cholesteatomas are benign, but locally invasive tumors of the middle ear that are thought to arise from the squamous epithelium of the tympanic membrane. They are often asymptomatic in the early stages, but can eventually lead to hearing loss, otorrhea, and facial nerve paralysis.

Osteomata are benign, slow-growing tumors of bone that can occur in any bone in the body, but are most common in the skull. They are typically asymptomatic, but can cause hearing loss, facial nerve paralysis, and tinnitus if they grow large enough to impinge on surrounding structures.

Tophaceous gout is a form of gout that is characterized by the deposition of uric acid crystals in soft tissues, including the middle ear. It can cause hearing loss, otalgia, and otorrhea.

Tympanosclerosis is a condition characterized by the deposition of calcium salts in the middle ear. It is often seen as a sequelae of otitis media, and can cause conductive hearing loss.

In this case, the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of cholesteatoma.

  8%|▊         | 118/1525 [27:29<5:36:10, 14.34s/it]The answer is **B. Foregut duplication cyst.**

A foregut duplication cyst is a rare congenital anomaly that arises from abnormal development of the foregut during embryogenesis. It is typically located in the posterior mediastinum, but can also occur in the neck, abdomen, or pelvis. Foregut duplication cysts are usually lined with columnar epithelium and may contain mucus, gastric or pancreatic secretions, or bile.

The most common presentation of a foregut duplication cyst is a mass in the neck or chest. The mass may be asymptomatic or may cause symptoms such as stridor, dysphagia, or respiratory distress. If the cyst is infected, it may cause fever, pain, and leukocytosis.

Diagnosis of a foregut duplication cyst is usually made with imaging studies such as CT scan or MRI. Treatment is surgical excision of the cyst. The prognosis for patients with foregut duplication cysts is excellent if the cyst is completely excised.

The other options are incorrect because they are not typically associated with stridor and dysphagia. Thymic cysts are typically asymptomatic and are discovered incidentally on imaging studies. Hemangiomas are benign tumors that are typically located in the skin or subcutaneous tissue. Lymphatic malformations are abnormal collections of lymphatic fluid that can occur anywhere in the body.

Explanation:
The most likely diagnosis is an epidermoid cyst. This is supported by the following findings:

* The mass was present since birth but had slowly grown larger in the previous 2 years. This is consistent with the slow growth of epidermoid cysts.
* On physical examination, a 2.5 × 1.5-cm, nontender, blue, soft, cystic mass was observed in the right postauricular area. This is a typical presentation for an epidermoid cyst.
* On temporal bone computed tomography, a 2.5 × 1.5-cm, hypodense, oval-shaped cystic mass was revealed at the subcutaneous fat layer superoposterior to the right auricle. This is also a typical finding for an epidermoid cyst.
* On temporal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an oval cystic mass was revealed at the same location, with high signal intensity on both T1-weighted and T2-weighted images and low signal intensity on enhanced T1-weighted fat suppression and T2-weighted short T1 inversion recovery images. This is another typical finding for an epidermoid cyst.
* In surgery, the well-demarcated cystic mass was completely excised. Yellowish fluid leaked out of the cyst during excision. This is also consistent with an epidermoid cyst.
* On histopathologic examination, the cyst was lined by keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium with hair follicles and sebaceous glands. The cyst contained keratinous debris. This is the most definitive finding in support of the diagnosis of an epidermoid cyst.

Pilomatricoma, type 1 first branchial cleft cyst, and hemangioma are all less likely diagnoses. Pilomatricoma is a benign tumor that typically presents as a small, painful nodule. Type 1 first branchial cleft cyst is a congenital anomaly that typically presents as a cystic mass in the preauricular or parotid region. Hemangioma is a benign vascular tumor that typically presents as a red, raised lesion.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for the patient is an epidermoid cyst.

The patient's presentation is consistent with laryngeal sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease of unknown etiology. The most common presentation is with pulmonary involvement, but extrapulmonary involvement can occur in up to 50% of cases. The larynx is the most common extrapulmonary site of involvement, followed by the skin, eyes, and lymph nodes.

The diagnosis of sarcoidosis is made by biopsy. The characteristic histopathologic finding is the noncaseating granuloma. The differential diagnosis of laryngeal sarcoidosis includes other granulomatous diseases, such as tuberculosis, fungal infections, and Wegener granulomatosis.

The treatment of laryngeal sarcoidosis is typically with corticosteroids. In some cases, other immunosuppressive agents may be necessary. The prognosis for laryngeal sarcoidosis is generally good, with most patients experiencing resolution of their symptoms with treatment.

Here are some of the reasons why the other answers are incorrect:

* Answer A: Laryngopharyngeal reflux is a common condition that is characterized by the reflux of gastric contents into the larynx. The patient's presentation is not consistent with laryngopharyngeal reflux.
* Answer C: Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a systemic vasculitis that can involve the lungs, kidneys, and other organs. The patient's presentation is not consistent with GPA.
* Answer D: Laryngeal tuberculosis is a rare condition that is caused by the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacterium. The patient's presentation is not consistent with laryngeal tuberculosis.

Explanation:

Pemphigoid nodularis is a rare, chronic, autoimmune blistering skin disease characterized by the formation of pruritic, deep-seated, subcutaneous nodules. The disease is most commonly seen in middle-aged and elderly women, and there is no known cure.

The diagnosis of pemphigoid nodularis is made based on the clinical presentation, skin biopsy findings, and direct immunofluorescence testing. In pemphigoid nodularis, the direct immunofluorescence test will show linear deposition of immunoglobulin G and complement along the basement membrane zone.

The treatment of pemphigoid nodularis is aimed at controlling the pruritus and inflammation. Topical steroids, oral antihistamines, and systemic corticosteroids are often used. In some cases, immunosuppressive drugs such as azathioprine or cyclophosphamide may be necessary.

The prognosis for pemphigoid nodularis is variable. Some patients experience spontaneous remission, while others have a chronic, relapsing course. The disease can be disfiguring, and it can also lead to secondary infections.

The other options are incorrect because they do not fit the clinical presentation of the patient in the case. Prurigo nodularis is a chronic, pruritic skin condition characterized by the formation of grouped, erythematous, excoriated papules and nodules. Acquired perforating dermatosis is a rare, chronic, acquired dermatosis characterized by the development of perforating pits in the skin.

Explanation:

Multifocal infantile hemangioma is a benign vascular tumor that occurs in the skin of infants. It is the most common type of hemangioma, accounting for 60% of all hemangiomas. Hemangiomas are typically diagnosed within the first few weeks of life and grow rapidly during the first 6 months of life. They then typically involute (shrink) over time, with most hemangiomas disappearing completely by age 5.

The patient in the case report presents with multiple cutaneous red papules that were first noticed at birth. The papules grew in number and size during the following months, involving the head and neck, trunk, extremities, right palm, mons pubis, and buttocks. At the height of severity, the patient had 39 lesions, some of which were associated with ulceration and bleeding. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of multifocal infantile hemangioma.

Bacillary angiomatosis is a rare, multisystem infection caused by Bartonella henselae. It is most commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, but it can also occur in healthy individuals. Bacillary angiomatosis typically presents with multiple red or purple skin lesions that are often painful and tender. The lesions can be anywhere on the body, but they are most commonly seen on the extremities, trunk, and face. Bacillary angiomatosis can also involve the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow.

Multifocal lymphangioendotheliomatosis with thrombocytopenia is a rare, life-threatening disorder characterized by the proliferation of lymphatic endothelial cells. It is most commonly seen in children under the age of 2. Multifocal lymphangioendotheliomatosis with thrombocytopenia typically presents with multiple red or purple skin lesions that are often painful and tender. The lesions can be anywhere on the body, but they are most commonly seen on the extremities, trunk, and face. Multifocal lymphangioendotheliomatosis with thrombocytopenia can also involve the liver, spleen, lymph nodes, and bone marrow.

Congenital disseminated pyogenic granuloma is a rare, benign skin condition that occurs in newborns. It is characterized by multiple, red, raised lesions that are often ulcerated. The lesions can be anywhere on the body, but they are most commonly seen on the head and neck. Congenital disseminated pyogenic granuloma is typically self-limited and resolves within a few months.

In conclusion, the patient in the case report presents with multiple cutaneous red papules that were first noticed at birth. The papules grew in number and size during the following months, involving the head and neck, trunk, extremities, right palm, mons pubis, and buttocks. At the height of severity, the patient had 39 lesions, some of which were associated with ulceration and bleeding. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of multifocal infantile hemangioma.

The patient has a nonfatigable partial left-eyelid ptosis, left-eye hypotropia at primary position, and impaired left eye supraduction with a nonreactive left pupil on direct and consensual light reflexes. There were no other cranial nerve deficits. Limb reflexes, motor testing, and sensory testing results were normal, and the plantar responses were flexor.

These findings are consistent with a neurovascular conflict of the oculomotor nerve. The oculomotor nerve is the third cranial nerve, which controls eye movement, pupil dilation, and eyelid function. It passes through the cavernous sinus, a space in the skull that contains blood vessels and cranial nerves. If the oculomotor nerve is compressed by a blood vessel, it can cause the symptoms that the patient is experiencing.

Myasthenia gravis is a disease that causes muscle weakness. It is not likely in this case because the patient does not have any other symptoms of muscle weakness, such as weakness in the arms or legs.

A Holmes Adie pupil is a condition that causes a small, nonreactive pupil. It is not likely in this case because the patient also has ptosis and hypotropia, which are not typically seen with a Holmes Adie pupil.

A posterior communicating artery aneurysm is a bulge in a blood vessel in the brain. It is not likely in this case because the patient's CT angiography did not show any aneurysms.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is neurovascular conflict of the oculomotor nerve.

Explanation:
The patient is presenting with a dome-shaped eyelid nodule, a vesicular lesion on the caruncle, and conjunctival hyperemia. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of molluscum contagiosum, a viral infection that is spread through contact with infected skin or objects. The most common treatment for molluscum contagiosum is to isolate the patient and notify public health authorities, as the infection is highly contagious. In some cases, the lesions may be removed by unroofing and curettage or with cryotherapy. However, these treatments are not always necessary and may be associated with more side effects than isolation. Oral acyclovir is not effective against molluscum contagiosum.

The patient is an 11-year-old boy with a white retinal lesion with calcification in his left eye. The lesion is non-vascularized and has no associated vitritis. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of retinoblastoma, a rare but aggressive form of childhood cancer.

Retinoblastoma is a genetic disease, and approximately 40% of cases are inherited. The remaining cases are caused by a spontaneous mutation in the RB1 gene. Genetic testing can identify children who are at risk for developing retinoblastoma, and can also be used to monitor children who have already been diagnosed with the disease.

If the patient is found to have a mutation in the RB1 gene, he will need to be closely monitored by an ophthalmologist. This will include regular eye exams to look for signs of disease progression. Treatment for retinoblastoma may include surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy.

The other options are incorrect because:

* A: Orbital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not necessary in the initial evaluation of a child with a retinal lesion. MRI may be used to assess the extent of disease in children with advanced retinoblastoma, but it is not necessary for diagnosis or treatment of early-stage disease.
* B: Biopsy of the lesion is not necessary in the initial evaluation of a child with a retinal lesion. Biopsy may be used to confirm a diagnosis of retinoblastoma in children with atypical findings, but it is not necessary for diagnosis or treatment of typical cases.
* D: Rule out infectious diseases is not necessary in the initial evaluation of a child with a retinal lesion. Infectious diseases are not a common cause of retinal lesions in children.

The patient's history of high hyperopia and amblyopia, as well as the abnormal foveal contour discovered when he was aged 3 years, are all suggestive of a genetic condition affecting the retina. Genetic testing would be the most appropriate next step to determine the underlying cause of the patient's condition and to assess his risk for other ocular problems.

A B-scan ultrasonography is not necessary in this case, as the patient's visual acuity is good and there are no signs of retinal detachment or other serious ocular problems. Observation is also not appropriate, as the patient's condition is likely to progress over time. Fundus autofluorescence is a useful tool for diagnosing and monitoring certain retinal diseases, but it is not the most appropriate next step in this case.

In conclusion, the best next step in the management of this patient is to perform genetic testing to assess for ocular diseases.

Explanation:
The patient has a history of endophthalmitis, which is an infection of the inner eye. The infection was treated with intravitreal antibiotics, but the patient still has numerous white retinal lesions. These lesions could be caused by the infection, but they could also be caused by other conditions, such as fungal infection or retinal detachment. To determine the cause of the lesions, a pars plana vitrectomy with vitreous biopsy is needed. This procedure involves removing a small piece of the vitreous gel from the eye and examining it under a microscope. The results of the biopsy will help to determine the best course of treatment for the patient.

A. Repeat intravitreal antibiotics is incorrect because the patient has already been treated with intravitreal antibiotics and the infection has not resolved. Repeating the antibiotics is unlikely to be effective and could potentially damage the eye.

C. Observation is incorrect because the patient has numerous white retinal lesions that could be caused by a serious condition, such as fungal infection or retinal detachment. Observation could allow the condition to worsen and could result in permanent vision loss.

D. Intravitreal antifungals is incorrect because the patient has no history of fungal infection and there is no evidence that the white retinal lesions are caused by a fungal infection. Intravitreal antifungals could potentially damage the eye and would not be effective in treating the patient's condition.

  8%|▊         | 128/1525 [29:41<4:27:18, 11.48s/it]The correct answer is C: Biopsy of the conjunctival lesion including a fresh specimen for flow cytometry.

The patient presented with an erythematous right lower eyelid lesion with a vermiform appearance, accompanied by pruritus and pain. The lesion resolved after 1 month, but she developed redness and swelling of the inner part of her right conjunctiva the next day. She denied any vision changes, eye pain, eye discharge, or systemic symptoms, such as fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss, or diarrhea. The patient had recently immigrated from rural Moldova 1 month prior to presentation, where she had exposure to farm animals, including dogs and cats. She had not traveled to any other countries.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of molluscum contagiosum, a viral infection caused by the poxvirus Molluscum contagiosum. Molluscum contagiosum is a common infection, especially in children, and is spread through skin-to-skin contact or contact with contaminated objects. The initial lesion of molluscum contagiosum is a small, raised papule that is often pearly white or flesh-colored. The lesions are usually painless and self-limited, but they can persist for several months or even years.

The diagnosis of molluscum contagiosum is usually made based on the patient's history and physical examination. However, a biopsy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis, especially in cases where the lesions are atypical or when there is a concern for other possible causes, such as a skin cancer.

The treatment of molluscum contagiosum is usually not necessary, as the lesions will eventually resolve on their own. However, treatment may be indicated in cases where the lesions are large or numerous, or when they are causing significant discomfort or cosmetic concerns. Treatment options include cryotherapy, curettage, and topical medications.

In the case of the patient described in the question, the most appropriate next step is to perform a biopsy of the conjunctival lesion. This will allow for a definitive diagnosis of molluscum contagiosum and will help to rule out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms. The biopsy specimen can then be sent for flow cytometry, which is a test that can be used to identify the specific type of virus that is causing the infection. This information can then be used to select the most appropriate treatment option for the patient.

The other options listed in the question are not appropriate for the patient described in the question. Cryotherapy is a treatment option that is used to freeze and destroy the lesions of molluscum contagiosum. However, it is not appropriate for the patient described in the question, as the lesions are located on the conjunctiva, which is the inner lining of the eyelid. Cryotherapy of the conjunctiva can cause serious complications, such as corneal scarring and blindness.

Injection of subconjunctival lidocaine followed by surgical removal of the lesion is another treatment option for molluscum contagiosum. However, it is not appropriate for the patient described in the question, as the lesions are located on the conjunctiva. Surgical removal of the conjunctiva can cause serious complications, such as corneal scarring and blindness.

Oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and topical corticosteroids are not effective treatments for molluscum contagiosum. These medications can be used to relieve the symptoms of the infection, such as pain and itching. However, they will not cause the lesions to resolve.

Explanation:

The patient is an 81-year-old woman with a 3-month history of a slow-growing mass in her left cheek. She denied having any symptoms, tenderness, numbness, or facial nerve weakness. Physical examination revealed a mass in the buccinator space that was smooth, was nontender to palpation, and had no overlying cutaneous changes. A contrast-enhanced maxillofacial computed tomography scan demonstrated a 1.8 × 1.8 × 1.9-cm rounded, well-circumscribed lesion at the anterior aspect of the left masticator space. The mass was abutting the parotid duct, which did not appear dilated, and appeared to have a peripheral rim of hyperenhancing soft tissue with a central cystic/necrotic component. Results of ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration revealed rare epithelial cells with degenerative changes and inflammatory cells present. Findings from a core biopsy demonstrated a spindle cell neoplasm of uncertain origin. On immunostaining, spindle cells were CK8/18, S100, and SOX10 negative; myosin and smooth muscle actin (SMA) negative; and CD31 negative. However, STAT6 staining was diffusely positive.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is a solitary fibrous tumor (SFT). SFTs are rare, mesenchymal neoplasms that can occur in any part of the body, but are most commonly found in the pleura, retroperitoneum, and mediastinum. They are typically benign, but can rarely be malignant. SFTs are composed of spindle-shaped cells that are positive for STAT6, a transcription factor that is involved in cell proliferation and differentiation.

The other possible diagnoses in this case are myopericytoma, synovial sarcoma, and neurofibroma. Myopericytoma is a rare, benign neoplasm of pericytes, which are cells that surround blood vessels. Synovial sarcoma is a rare, malignant neoplasm that arises from the synovium, the lining of joint capsules. Neurofibroma is a benign neoplasm of Schwann cells, which are cells that myelinate nerve fibers.

The differential diagnosis for a spindle cell neoplasm of the head and neck includes a number of other entities, such as schwannoma, leiomyoma, and hemangioma. However, the combination of the patient's age, clinical presentation, imaging findings, and immunohistochemical results is most consistent with a diagnosis of SFT.

A facial nerve schwannoma is a benign tumor that arises from the Schwann cells that myelinate the facial nerve. It is the most common type of tumor that occurs in the internal auditory canal. The tumor is typically slow-growing and may not cause symptoms for many years. However, as it grows, it can compress the facial nerve, causing facial paralysis, and the auditory nerve, causing hearing loss. In some cases, the tumor can also extend into the brain, causing seizures or other neurological problems.

The diagnosis of a facial nerve schwannoma is made with imaging studies, such as MRI or CT scan. Treatment typically involves surgery to remove the tumor. In some cases, radiation therapy may also be used. The prognosis for patients with facial nerve schwannoma is generally good, with most patients experiencing good recovery from facial paralysis and hearing loss after surgery.

The other options are incorrect because they are not typically associated with the clinical presentation described in the case. A vestibular nerve schwannoma is a type of tumor that arises from the Schwann cells that myelinate the vestibular nerve. It is the second most common type of tumor that occurs in the internal auditory canal. Vestibular nerve schwannomas are typically slow-growing and may not cause symptoms for many years. However, as they grow, they can compress the vestibular nerve, causing vertigo, hearing loss, and tinnitus. In some cases, the tumor can also extend into the brain, causing seizures or other neurological problems.

A neuromuscular choristoma is a rare type of tumor that arises from the Schwann cells and skeletal muscle cells. It is typically found in the head and neck region, and can cause a variety of symptoms, including facial paralysis, hearing loss, and seizures.

A hemangioma is a benign tumor that arises from the blood vessels. It is the most common type of tumor in infants and children. Hemangiomas can occur anywhere in the body, but are most common on the skin. They are typically small and harmless, but can sometimes grow large enough to cause problems.

Explanation:

Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare, non-infectious skin condition that can cause painful, rapidly-spreading ulcers. It is most commonly seen in people with inflammatory bowel disease, but it can also occur in people with other autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and Sjögren's syndrome.

The exact cause of pyoderma gangrenosum is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune condition. In people with pyoderma gangrenosum, the immune system attacks healthy skin cells, causing inflammation and ulceration.

The most common symptom of pyoderma gangrenosum is a painful, red, swollen area of skin that quickly develops into an ulcer. The ulcers can be large and deep, and they often have a black, necrotic center. They can occur anywhere on the body, but they are most common on the legs, arms, and abdomen.

There is no cure for pyoderma gangrenosum, but it can be treated with a variety of medications, including steroids, antibiotics, and immunosuppressants. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the ulcers.

The prognosis for pyoderma gangrenosum varies depending on the severity of the condition. In most cases, the ulcers will heal with treatment, but they can leave scars. In some cases, pyoderma gangrenosum can be life-threatening.

The patient in the case presented with a tender, draining lesion of the central face despite several courses of treatment with antibiotics. She also had a history of immunoglobulin A monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance, which is a type of autoimmune disease. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms. Lupus vulgaris is a chronic skin condition that causes red, scaly patches on the skin. Coccidioidomycosis is a fungal infection that can cause pneumonia and other respiratory problems. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a rare autoimmune disease that can cause inflammation of the blood vessels.

  9%|▊         | 132/1525 [30:37<5:12:55, 13.48s/it]Answer: D. Order an urgent electrophysiologic investigation.

Explanation:
The patient in this case has a history of mitral valve repair and presents with a new-onset supraventricular tachycardia. The ECG shows a regular tachycardia with a rate of 178 beats/min; no obvious P waves are recognizable. The QRS complexes displayed 2 different morphologies occurring with a definite allorhythmic distribution: pairs of beats exhibiting complete right bundle branch block (RBBB) and QRS duration of 140 milliseconds followed by a third beat with normal configuration and QRS duration of 70 milliseconds. This trigeminal variation in intraventricular conduction occurred without any change in cycle length and was maintained. Adenosine administration quickly slowed the ventricular rate allowing recognition of an atrial tachycardia with a rate of 178/min and a 2:1 atrioventricular (AV) ratio.

The most likely cause of this patient's tachycardia is an atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT). AVNRT is the most common type of supraventricular tachycardia, accounting for up to 70% of cases. It is caused by a reentrant circuit that involves the AV node and an accessory pathway. The accessory pathway is a bypass tract that allows electrical impulses to bypass the AV node and travel directly from the atria to the ventricles. This can result in a rapid heart rate.

The treatment of AVNRT depends on the patient's symptoms and the severity of the tachycardia. In most cases, the tachycardia can be terminated with adenosine or verapamil. If these medications are not effective, or if the patient has recurrent tachycardia, a catheter ablation procedure may be necessary. Catheter ablation is a minimally invasive procedure that involves using radiofrequency energy to destroy the accessory pathway. This usually results in a cure for AVNRT.

In this case, the patient is hemodynamically stable and does not have any symptoms of heart failure or ischemia. Therefore, the first step in management is to order an urgent electrophysiologic investigation. This procedure will allow the cardiologist to determine the mechanism of the tachycardia and to identify the accessory pathway. Once the accessory pathway has been identified, it can be destroyed with catheter ablation. This will result in a cure for the tachycardia.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Option A, performing urgent DC shock, is not necessary because the patient is hemodynamically stable and does not have any symptoms of heart failure or ischemia. Option B, placing a temporary pacemaker, is also not necessary because the patient's heart rate is not slow enough to warrant pacing. Option C, starting treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin and amiodarone, is not appropriate because these medications are not indicated for the treatment of AVNRT.

  9%|▊         | 133/1525 [30:52<5:23:16, 13.93s/it]The correct answer is: **Eosinophilic fasciitis.**

The patient presented with insidious onset of limited mobility of joints, which is a classic symptom of eosinophilic fasciitis. Other symptoms include skin thickening, pain, and swelling. The patient also had eosinophilia, which is an increase in the number of eosinophils in the blood. Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell that is involved in the immune response. Eosinophilic fasciitis is a rare autoimmune disorder that is characterized by inflammation of the fascia, which is the connective tissue that surrounds muscles and organs. The inflammation can cause the skin to thicken and the muscles to become weak. The exact cause of eosinophilic fasciitis is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder. Autoimmune disorders occur when the body's immune system attacks its own tissues. There is no cure for eosinophilic fasciitis, but treatment can help to control the symptoms. Treatment typically includes corticosteroids, which are drugs that reduce inflammation. Other treatments may include physical therapy and occupational therapy.

A: Myotonic dystrophy is a genetic disorder that causes muscle weakness and wasting. It is characterized by myotonia, which is a prolonged contraction of muscles after voluntary contraction. The patient does not have any of the classic symptoms of myotonic dystrophy, such as muscle weakness and wasting.

B: Systemic sclerosis is a chronic autoimmune disorder that causes the skin and internal organs to become thick and stiff. It is characterized by Raynaud phenomenon, which is a condition in which the fingers and toes become pale, numb, and painful when exposed to cold or stress. The patient does not have any of the classic symptoms of systemic sclerosis, such as Raynaud phenomenon.

C: Deep morphea (morphea profunda) is a rare form of scleroderma that affects the deep layers of the skin. It is characterized by skin thickening, pain, and swelling. The patient does not have any of the classic symptoms of deep morphea, such as skin thickening.

D: Eosinophilic fasciitis is the most likely diagnosis for the patient. The patient has all of the classic symptoms of eosinophilic fasciitis, including limited mobility of joints, skin thickening, pain, and swelling. The patient also has eosinophilia, which is a laboratory finding that is consistent with eosinophilic fasciitis.

  9%|▉         | 134/1525 [31:08<5:39:15, 14.63s/it]Answer: C. Restart daily oral itraconazole.

Explanation:
The patient has recurrent skin, nail, and oral mucosal abnormalities caused by Candida albicans. She has a history of successful treatment with itraconazole, and her current symptoms are consistent with a relapse of her infection. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to restart daily oral itraconazole.

Cefazolin is an antibiotic that is not effective against Candida albicans. Therefore, it would not be an appropriate treatment for this patient's infection. Hydrocortisone cream is a topical corticosteroid that is used to treat inflammation. It would not be an effective treatment for this patient's infection, as it does not have antifungal activity. Terbinafine is an oral antifungal medication that is used to treat fungal infections of the skin, nails, and hair. It is not effective against Candida albicans, and therefore would not be an appropriate treatment for this patient's infection.

Explanation:

The patient is a 42-year-old woman with a history of a functional pituitary adenoma, breast cancer in remission for which she was undergoing tamoxifen therapy, and prior bilateral laser in situ keratomileusis surgery. She presents with right lagophthalmos, blurry vision, and a sensation of eye dryness. She was found to have incomplete eyelid closure by her primary care physician, who initiated artificial tear lubrication and bedtime eyelid taping with partial symptom improvement.

The patient's history and examination findings are concerning for Graves' orbitopathy, a thyroid-related autoimmune disorder that can cause inflammation and fibrosis of the orbital tissues. Graves' orbitopathy can lead to a variety of clinical features, including upper eyelid retraction, lagophthalmos, proptosis, and optic nerve compression.

The gold standard for diagnosing Graves' orbitopathy is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbit. MRI can help to assess the extent of inflammation and fibrosis in the orbit, as well as to identify any potential complications, such as optic nerve compression.

Serum thyroid laboratory testing can be helpful in the diagnosis of Graves' disease, the underlying cause of Graves' orbitopathy. However, serum thyroid laboratory testing is not always specific for Graves' disease, and it can be normal in patients with Graves' orbitopathy.

Systemic steroid and antiviral therapy may be used to treat the inflammation associated with Graves' orbitopathy. However, these medications are not always effective, and they can have significant side effects.

Upper eyelid gold weight implantation is a surgical procedure that can be used to correct upper eyelid retraction. However, upper eyelid gold weight implantation is not always effective, and it can have significant side effects, such as foreign body sensation and eyelid asymmetry.

Therefore, the best next step in the management of this patient is to obtain a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbit.

The patient has a history of cutaneous melanoma, and the pigmented lesion in the right eye could be a metastasis of the melanoma. However, the lesion is well-demarcated and does not extend into the angle, which is a favorable finding. The patient also does not have any signs or symptoms of uveitis, which is another concerning finding. Therefore, it is reasonable to observe the lesion with close follow-up to see if it changes over time. If the lesion does not change, or if it changes in a benign way, then no further treatment would be necessary. However, if the lesion changes in a concerning way, such as growing larger or extending into the angle, then further treatment, such as a corneal biopsy or surgical excision, would be necessary.

The other options are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate management for this patient. Option A, corneal biopsy, is not necessary because the lesion is well-demarcated and does not extend into the angle. Option B, surgical excision, is also not necessary because the lesion is small and does not appear to be causing any problems. Option D, prednisolone 4 times a day in the right eye, is not the most appropriate management because the lesion is not inflammatory in nature.

The patient has a complex infantile hemangioma involving the orbit, pterygopalatine fossa, and cheek. He has already undergone two embolization and debulking procedures, which were successful in reducing the size of the lesion but did not prevent the development of amblyopia. The patient now presents with a persistent cheek and orbit lesion, dense amblyopia, large-angle monocular esotropia and hypertropia, and proptosis of the left eye. The left extraocular muscle shows inability to abduct past midline. A repeated magnetic resonance image shows persistent orbital involvement causing medial displacement of the lateral rectus muscle and mass effect on the globe.

Given the patient's clinical presentation and history, the next best step in management is to proceed with interventional radiology embolization and debulking. This procedure involves injecting a substance into the blood vessels that supply the hemangioma, which can cause the lesion to shrink or even disappear. In some cases, debulking may also be necessary, which involves surgically removing part of the hemangioma.

Repeated trial of oral prednisolone is not a good option because the patient has already been treated with this medication and it did not prevent the development of amblyopia. Pulsed dye laser therapy is also not a good option because it is not effective in treating complex infantile hemangiomas. Oral sirolimus is a medication that is used to treat cancer, but it has not been shown to be effective in treating hemangiomas.

Therefore, the next best step in management is to proceed with interventional radiology embolization and debulking.

Explanation:

Intravascular anaplastic large cell lymphoma (IVL) is a rare, aggressive subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that typically affects adults. IVL is characterized by the infiltration of large, atypical lymphoid cells within blood vessels. The lesions of IVL are typically ill-defined, indurated erythematous-violaceous patches, nodules, and plaques. The lesions may be associated with erosions and crusts.

The diagnosis of IVL is made on the basis of a biopsy of the involved skin. The biopsy shows sheets of large, atypical lymphoid cells within blood vessels. The cells have large, irregular, pleomorphic nuclei. Immunohistochemical staining reveals that the tumor cells are positive for CD3 and negative for CD20, AE1/AE3, CK20, chromogranin A, and melan-A. The Ki-67 labeling index is typically high.

There is no standard treatment for IVL. Treatment may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery. The prognosis for patients with IVL is poor. The median survival time for patients with IVL is approximately 1 year.

The other options are incorrect because they do not fit the clinical presentation of the patient.

Option B, Large B-cell lymphoma, is incorrect because the patient does not have any of the typical features of large B-cell lymphoma, such as lymphadenopathy, fever, or night sweats.

Option C, Metastatic carcinoma, is incorrect because the patient does not have any of the typical features of metastatic carcinoma, such as a history of cancer, a mass on physical examination, or abnormal findings on imaging studies.

Option D, Natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, is incorrect because the patient does not have any of the typical features of natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, such as skin lesions, fever, or weight loss.

Mycosis fungoides is a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL), a rare type of cancer that affects the skin. It is the most common form of CTCL, accounting for about 80% of cases.

Mycosis fungoides typically starts as a small, scaly patch on the skin. The patch may be red, brown, or purple, and it may be itchy. Over time, the patch may spread to other areas of the skin, and it may become thickened and scaly. In some cases, mycosis fungoides can also affect the lymph nodes, blood, and internal organs.

There is no cure for mycosis fungoides, but there are treatments that can help to control the disease. Treatment options include topical therapy, phototherapy, and systemic therapy.

In the case presented, the patient has a history of hypopigmented cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL, mycosis fungoides type). He has been treated with a regimen of narrowband UV-B phototherapy and triamcinolone cream, which he has continued for 4 years. However, he has recently experienced a significant worsening of his symptoms. On physical examination, he has large annular plaques with peripheral hyperpigmentation of the body. There are also confluent, indurated pink plaques with slightly raised edges along the forehead, malar eminence, and scalp. The nasal septum demonstrates an inverted V deformity with compromise of the keystone junction. Nasal passages are obstructed with thick mucus and synechiae formation, nearly obstructing the entire nasal passage bilaterally.

The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with progression of his CTCL. The development of new lesions, the worsening of existing lesions, and the involvement of new areas of the body are all signs of disease progression. The patient's nasal congestion is likely due to the obstruction of his nasal passages by the enlarged lymph nodes in his nose.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect any part of the body, but it most commonly affects the lungs, lymph nodes, skin, and eyes. It is characterized by the formation of granulomas, which are small collections of immune cells. The patient's clinical presentation is not consistent with sarcoidosis.
* Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a rare autoimmune disease that affects the blood vessels. It is characterized by the inflammation and necrosis of small blood vessels, which can lead to organ damage. The patient's clinical presentation is not consistent with GPA.
* Lepromatous leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae. It is characterized by the formation of skin lesions, nerve damage, and deformities. The patient's clinical presentation is not consistent with lepromatous leprosy.

Recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) is a common, noncancerous condition that causes benign tumors to grow in the airways. It is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), which is a sexually transmitted infection. RRP can occur in people of any age, but it is most common in children.

The symptoms of RRP vary depending on the location of the tumors. In the larynx, the tumors can cause hoarseness, stridor, and difficulty breathing. In the lungs, the tumors can cause cough, wheezing, and pneumonia.

The diagnosis of RRP is made with a biopsy of the tumor. Treatment options include surgery, laser therapy, and cryotherapy. In some cases, a combination of treatments may be necessary.

The prognosis for RRP is good. With treatment, most people with RRP can live normal lives. However, the tumors may recur, and treatment may be necessary on a regular basis.

The other options are incorrect because:

* Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that can occur in the larynx. It is not caused by HPV.
* Coccidioidomycosis is a fungal infection that can cause lung disease. It is not caused by HPV.
* Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection that can cause lung disease. It is not caused by HPV.

  9%|▉         | 141/1525 [32:42<5:44:40, 14.94s/it]The answer is: **A. Sarcoidosis**

Explanation:

The patient's presentation is consistent with sarcoidosis, a multisystem granulomatous disease of unknown etiology. The most common clinical manifestations are pulmonary involvement (90%), followed by lymphadenopathy (80%), skin lesions (25%), and eye involvement (20%). Laryngeal involvement is rare, occurring in <5% of patients.

The characteristic histopathologic finding in sarcoidosis is noncaseating granulomas. These granulomas can be found in any organ system, but they are most commonly seen in the lungs, lymph nodes, skin, and eyes. The diagnosis of sarcoidosis is made based on a combination of clinical, radiographic, and laboratory findings. The chest X-ray is often abnormal, showing bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. The serum angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level is elevated in >80% of patients with sarcoidosis.

The treatment of sarcoidosis is generally supportive. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy for symptomatic patients. Other treatment options include other immunosuppressive agents, such as methotrexate or azathioprine. The prognosis of sarcoidosis is generally good. Most patients have a self-limited course, with spontaneous resolution of symptoms within a few years. However, a small subset of patients have a chronic, progressive disease.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's presentation as well as sarcoidosis does. Blastomycosis is a fungal infection that can cause pulmonary, cutaneous, and disseminated disease. It is most common in the southeastern United States. The typical presentation of blastomycosis is fever, cough, and weight loss. Cutaneous lesions are often seen in patients with disseminated disease. The diagnosis of blastomycosis is made based on clinical, radiographic, and laboratory findings. The chest X-ray may show consolidation or nodules. The serum galactomannan antigen is positive in >90% of patients with blastomycosis. The treatment of blastomycosis is with antifungal agents, such as amphotericin B or itraconazole.

Squamous cell cancer is the most common type of cancer of the larynx. It is typically seen in older men who have a history of smoking. The most common presenting symptom is hoarseness. Other symptoms may include dyspnea, odynophagia, and neck mass. The diagnosis of squamous cell cancer is made based on biopsy. The treatment of squamous cell cancer is with surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.

Tuberculosis is an infection caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is most commonly seen in the lungs, but it can also affect other organs, such as the lymph nodes, bones, and kidneys. The typical presentation of tuberculosis is fever, cough, and weight loss. The diagnosis of tuberculosis is made based on clinical, radiographic, and laboratory findings. The chest X-ray may show consolidation or nodules. The sputum smear is positive for acid-fast bacilli in >50% of patients with tuberculosis. The treatment of tuberculosis is with antibiotics, such as isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide.

Multicentric reticulohistiocytosis (MRH) is a rare, chronic, inflammatory disease characterized by the proliferation of histiocytes in the skin, lymph nodes, and other organs. It is most commonly diagnosed in children, but can occur in adults as well. The cause of MRH is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disease.

The classic presentation of MRH is with multiple skin-colored or red nodules on the face, hands, feet, and buttocks. The nodules can be painful and tender, and may ulcerate. In addition to the skin lesions, patients with MRH may also have lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and bone marrow involvement.

The diagnosis of MRH is made based on the clinical presentation, a skin biopsy, and laboratory tests. The skin biopsy shows a characteristic infiltrate of histiocytes. Laboratory tests may show an elevated white blood cell count, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and an elevated C-reactive protein level.

There is no cure for MRH, but treatment can help to control the symptoms and improve the quality of life. Treatment options include corticosteroids, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.

The other options are incorrect because they do not match the clinical presentation of the patient in the case. Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis is a rare, genetic disorder characterized by the formation of multiple soft tissue tumors. Farber disease is a rare, genetic disorder characterized by the accumulation of lipid in the body's tissues. Rheumatoid nodules are small, inflammatory nodules that form around joints in people with rheumatoid arthritis.

Explanation: The patient has a history of systemic sclerosis, a chronic autoimmune disease that causes thickening and tightening of the skin and connective tissues. The most common symptoms of systemic sclerosis are Raynaud phenomenon, sclerodactyly, and digital ulcers. Other symptoms may include joint pain, esophageal dysmotility, pulmonary fibrosis, and cardiac involvement.

The patient's rash is consistent with keloidal scleroderma, a rare condition that occurs in patients with systemic sclerosis. Keloidal scleroderma is characterized by the formation of firm, red-brown plaques on the skin. The plaques are often pruritic and may be associated with pain and tenderness.

Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease that can affect the lungs, skin, eyes, heart, and other organs. The most common symptoms of sarcoidosis are fatigue, fever, and weight loss. Other symptoms may include cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, skin lesions, and eye problems.

Lobomycosis is a chronic fungal infection that can affect the skin, bones, and lungs. The most common symptoms of lobomycosis are skin lesions, which are often raised and crusty. Other symptoms may include fever, cough, and weight loss.

Fibroblastic rheumatism is a rare autoimmune disease that causes inflammation of the connective tissues. The most common symptoms of fibroblastic rheumatism are joint pain, swelling, and stiffness. Other symptoms may include fever, rash, and weight loss.

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a vasculitis that affects large and medium-sized arteries, most commonly the temporal arteries. It is a systemic disease that can affect other organs, including the eyes, heart, and kidneys.

The most common symptoms of GCA are headache, jaw claudication, and scalp tenderness. Other symptoms may include fever, weight loss, fatigue, and myalgias.

The diagnosis of GCA is based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are typically elevated in GCA. A temporal artery biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis, but it is not always necessary.

Treatment of GCA is with high-dose corticosteroids. The goal of treatment is to reduce inflammation and prevent complications. Corticosteroid therapy is usually continued for 2-4 weeks, and then tapered over several months.

The prognosis for GCA is good with early diagnosis and treatment. However, if left untreated, GCA can lead to serious complications, including blindness, stroke, and heart attack.

The other possible answers are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Anti–transfer RNA synthetase myositis is an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation of the muscles. It is not associated with headache, jaw claudication, or scalp tenderness.
* Immunoglobulin G4–related disease is a group of autoimmune diseases that are characterized by the production of immunoglobulin G4 antibodies. It can affect the kidneys, skin, and other organs, but it is not typically associated with headache, jaw claudication, or scalp tenderness.
* Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disease that affects the neuromuscular junction. It causes weakness of the muscles, but it is not typically associated with headache, jaw claudication, or scalp tenderness.

The patient has bilateral refractory neurosensory retinal and pigment epithelial detachments. She has already received 32 near monthly injections of anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), but her condition has not improved. Photodynamic therapy is a treatment option for patients with exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) who have not responded to other treatments, such as anti–VEGF injections.

Photodynamic therapy involves injecting a drug called verteporfin (Visudyne) into a vein. The drug is then activated by a laser, which causes it to release a substance that destroys abnormal blood vessels in the retina. This can help to reduce the amount of fluid in the retina and improve vision.

The risks of photodynamic therapy include inflammation, bleeding, and damage to the retina. However, these risks are generally low, and the benefits of the treatment often outweigh the risks.

In this case, the patient has already tried other treatments without success. Photodynamic therapy is a safe and effective treatment option that may help to improve her vision.

A: Continue intravitreal anti-VEGF injections is incorrect because the patient has already received 32 near monthly injections of anti–VEGF, but her condition has not improved.

The patient has a history of progressive vision loss, cognitive impairment, and a family history of vision loss. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), a rare, inherited retinal disorder that causes progressive vision loss in early childhood. LCA is caused by mutations in a number of genes that are involved in the development and function of the retina.

Genetic testing is the most accurate way to diagnose LCA. It can also be used to identify the specific gene mutation that is causing the disease, which can help to predict the course of the disease and guide treatment options.

Electroretinography (ERG) is a test that measures the electrical activity of the retina. It can be used to diagnose LCA and to monitor the progression of the disease. However, ERG is not as accurate as genetic testing in diagnosing LCA.

Observation is not an appropriate management option for LCA. The disease is progressive and will eventually lead to blindness. Therefore, treatment is aimed at slowing the progression of the disease and improving the quality of life for patients.

Muscle biopsy is not a necessary test for LCA. The disease is caused by mutations in genes that are involved in the development and function of the retina, not the muscles.

Explanation:

The patient is a 2-month-old female with a left upper neck mass that was first noted at birth. The mass is nontender, avascular, and cystic. It is located in the submandibular region and extends into the tongue musculature. The mass is nonenhancing on CT scan and MRI. The fluid aspirated from the cyst is serous and cytology shows mature and anucleate squamous cells with acute inflammation.

The differential diagnosis for a congenital cystic neck mass in a child includes:

* Branchial cleft cyst
* Thyroglossal duct cyst
* Foregut duplication cyst
* Lymphatic malformation
* Ranula

Branchial cleft cysts are the most common type of congenital cystic neck mass, accounting for approximately 70% of cases. They arise from the remnants of the branchial arches, which are structures that form during embryonic development. Branchial cleft cysts can occur anywhere along the anterior border of the sternocleidomastoid muscle, from the angle of the mandible to the suprasternal notch. They are most commonly located in the submandibular region, as in this case.

Branchial cleft cysts are typically nontender, avascular, and cystic. They may be present at birth or may not become symptomatic until later in childhood. The mass may enlarge slowly over time. Branchial cleft cysts are usually noncancerous.

The diagnosis of a branchial cleft cyst is made based on the history, physical examination, and imaging studies. CT scan and MRI are the most helpful imaging studies for diagnosing branchial cleft cysts. CT scan can show the location, size, and extent of the cyst. MRI can show the internal contents of the cyst and the relationship of the cyst to surrounding structures.

The treatment for a branchial cleft cyst is surgical excision. The cyst is usually removed through a small incision in the neck. The prognosis for patients with branchial cleft cysts is excellent. With surgical excision, the vast majority of patients are cured.

The other options in the differential diagnosis are less likely in this case. Thyroglossal duct cysts are typically located in the midline of the neck, below the hyoid bone. Foregut duplication cysts are typically located in the abdomen. Lymphatic malformations are typically located in the head and neck, but they are usually not cystic. Ranulas are typically located in the floor of the mouth, and they do not extend into the tongue musculature.

Poikilodermatous plaque–like hemangioma (PHL) is a rare, benign vascular neoplasm that typically presents as a solitary, well-demarcated, erythematous-violaceous plaque on the lower extremities of older adults. The lesion is often pruritic and may be associated with atrophic changes in the skin. Histologically, PHL is characterized by a band-like proliferation of small, thin-walled capillaries in the upper dermis. The capillaries are often surrounded by a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate.

The differential diagnosis of PHL includes other benign vascular neoplasms such as acquired elastotic hemangioma, microvenular hemangioma, and acroangiodermatitis. Acquired elastotic hemangioma is a more common lesion that typically presents as a yellow-brown plaque on the face or neck. Microvenular hemangioma is a rare lesion that typically presents as a small, red papule on the face or extremities. Acroangiodermatitis is a rare, progressive disorder that typically presents as a violaceous plaque on the hands or feet.

The diagnosis of PHL is made on the basis of clinical and histopathologic findings. Treatment is generally not necessary, but topical corticosteroids or laser therapy may be used to improve the appearance of the lesion.

The following are the reasons why the other choices are incorrect:

* B. Acquired elastotic hemangioma is a more common lesion that typically presents as a yellow-brown plaque on the face or neck. The lesion in the case presentation is erythematous-violaceous, which is more consistent with PHL.
* C. Microvenular hemangioma is a rare lesion that typically presents as a small, red papule on the face or extremities. The lesion in the case presentation is larger and more plaque-like, which is more consistent with PHL.
* D. Acroangiodermatitis is a rare, progressive disorder that typically presents as a violaceous plaque on the hands or feet. The lesion in the case presentation is located on the lower extremity, which is not a typical location for acroangiodermatitis.

Explanation: The patient is a young man with a history of syncope and a family history of sudden cardiac death. The ECG shows a prolonged QT interval, which is a risk factor for ventricular arrhythmias. The next step in management is to place the patient on a 30-day ambulatory event monitor to assess for arrhythmias. If an arrhythmia is detected, the patient may need an electrophysiology study and/or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator.

The other options are incorrect because they are not the next step in management for this patient. A brain magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalogram are not necessary in this patient because there is no evidence of neurological disease. An implantable cardioverter defibrillator is not indicated for a patient with a prolonged QT interval without a history of ventricular arrhythmias. Ventricular ablation is not indicated for a patient with a prolonged QT interval without a history of ventricular arrhythmias.

The patient's history of syncope and a family history of sudden cardiac death are concerning for a potentially life-threatening arrhythmia. The next step in management is to place the patient on a 30-day ambulatory event monitor to assess for arrhythmias. If an arrhythmia is detected, the patient may need an electrophysiology study and/or an implantable cardioverter defibrillator.

The patient's history of abdominal pain and anemia is concerning for lead poisoning. Lead poisoning is a common cause of anemia in children, but it can also occur in adults. The bluish pigmentation along the patient's gingival margin is a classic sign of lead poisoning.

Lead poisoning can cause a variety of symptoms, including abdominal pain, anemia, fatigue, irritability, and loss of appetite. In severe cases, lead poisoning can lead to seizures, coma, and death.

To diagnose lead poisoning, a blood test is performed to measure the level of lead in the blood. If the blood lead level is elevated, the patient will be treated with chelation therapy to remove the lead from the body.

The other options are incorrect because they are not associated with lead poisoning.

A. Check blood lead concentration: This is the correct answer because the patient's history and physical examination are consistent with lead poisoning.
B. Order anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) level: This is not the correct answer because ANCA is not associated with lead poisoning.
C. Perform flow cytometry: This is not the correct answer because flow cytometry is not used to diagnose lead poisoning.
D. Perform urine test for porphobilinogen: This is not the correct answer because porphobilinogen is not associated with lead poisoning.

 10%|▉         | 152/1525 [35:19<5:29:08, 14.38s/it]The answer is: A. Fluorescein angiography.

Fluorescein angiography is a test that uses a special dye to look at the blood vessels in the eye. It can help to diagnose and monitor a number of eye conditions, including optic neuritis. In this case, the patient has bilateral papilledema and intact vision with normal intracranial pressure. This is a classic presentation of optic neuritis, which is inflammation of the optic nerve. Fluorescein angiography can help to confirm the diagnosis of optic neuritis and to assess the severity of the inflammation. It can also be used to monitor the response to treatment.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a protein that is involved in the growth and development of blood vessels. It is often elevated in patients with optic neuritis, but it is not a specific test for the condition.
* Repeated lumbar puncture is not necessary in this case, as the initial lumbar puncture showed a normal opening pressure.
* Acetazolamide is a medication that is used to reduce intracranial pressure. It is not indicated in this case, as the patient's intracranial pressure is normal.

In conclusion, the best next step in the management of this patient is to perform fluorescein angiography.

 10%|█         | 153/1525 [35:32<5:16:14, 13.83s/it]The answer is: A. Start intravenous corticosteroids for presumed serology-negative thyroid eye disease.

The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoid tumor (NET) status in remission after liver transplant who developed acute-onset severe bilateral periorbital swelling, chemosis, and ophthalmoplegia as well as occasional flushing and palpitations. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/70 in both eyes. Pupils, intraocular pressure, and color vision were normal. She had bilateral proptosis to 20/21 mm by Hertel exophthalmometer, −3 restriction of extraocular movements in all directions of gaze, diffuse punctate epithelial erosions, and mechanical lower lid entropion secondary to severe chemosis in both eyes. Anterior segment examination and dilated ophthalmoscopy results were otherwise unremarkable.

Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbit with contrast revealed bilateral and symmetric tendon-sparing extraocular muscle enlargement of all extraocular muscles (EOMs) with nodular heterogenous enhancement. She had no history of thyroid disease, and laboratory results, including thyrotropin, T3, T4, thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin, thyroid stimulating hormone receptor antibody, antimicrosomal antibody, IgG4, rheumatoid factor, and antinuclear antibodies, were all within normal limits.

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is serology-negative thyroid eye disease (TED). TED is an autoimmune disorder that occurs in patients with thyroid disease, most commonly Graves' disease. It is characterized by inflammation and enlargement of the extraocular muscles, which can lead to proptosis, ophthalmoplegia, and diplopia.

The treatment of TED is typically with corticosteroids, which can help to reduce inflammation and improve symptoms. In some cases, other medications, such as orbital radiation therapy or surgery, may be necessary.

In this patient, the most appropriate next step is to start intravenous corticosteroids for presumed serology-negative TED. This will help to reduce inflammation and improve her symptoms. Once she is stable, she can be started on oral corticosteroids. She may also need to be treated with orbital radiation therapy or surgery to further reduce inflammation and improve her vision.

The other options are not appropriate in this patient. Option B, obtaining positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT) imaging to look for additional metastases and biopsy sites, is not necessary because she has no history of cancer and her laboratory results are normal. Option C, biopsying the EOMs, is not necessary because the diagnosis of TED is already established. Option D, coordinating with primary team for treatment with octreotide, is not necessary because octreotide is not a first-line treatment for TED.

The patient has a positive interferon-gamma release assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which is a highly specific test for tuberculosis. The chest radiograph was normal, but this is not uncommon in tuberculosis, as the disease can often be localized to the eye. The patient's symptoms are consistent with tuberculosis of the eye, which is a serious condition that can lead to blindness if not treated. The treatment for tuberculosis of the eye is 4-drug antituberculous therapy. This treatment is usually given for 6-9 months.

The other options are incorrect because:

* Option A is incorrect because the patient's condition is not self-limited.
* Option B is incorrect because systemic steroids are not indicated for the treatment of tuberculosis of the eye.
* Option D is incorrect because magnetic resonance imaging of the brain with contrast and lumbar puncture are not necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of tuberculosis of the eye.

 10%|█         | 155/1525 [35:56<4:51:26, 12.76s/it]The correct answer is D: Perform pars plana vitrectomy with removal of intraocular lens and capsular bag plus intravitreal antibiotics.

The patient has a history of primary open-angle glaucoma, which is a chronic condition that causes damage to the optic nerve and results in progressive loss of vision. The patient is currently being treated with a fixed-combination prostaglandin and β-blocker, but his IOP is not well-controlled. In addition, the patient has a milky substance in the retrolental space, which is a sign of posterior capsular opacification (PCO). PCO is a common complication of cataract surgery that can occur years after the surgery. The milky substance in the retrolental space can block light from reaching the retina, which can cause visual deterioration.

The most appropriate treatment for the patient is to perform a pars plana vitrectomy with removal of the intraocular lens and capsular bag plus intravitreal antibiotics. A pars plana vitrectomy is a surgical procedure that involves removing the vitreous humor, which is a gel-like substance that fills the inside of the eye. The intraocular lens is a plastic lens that is implanted in the eye during cataract surgery. The capsular bag is a thin, transparent membrane that surrounds the intraocular lens. In cases of PCO, the capsular bag can become opacified, which can block light from reaching the retina.

The removal of the intraocular lens and capsular bag will help to improve the patient's vision. The intravitreal antibiotics will help to prevent infection.

The other options are not as appropriate for the patient. Option A, treating with pilocarpine eye drops, is not a definitive treatment for PCO. Option B, scheduling for glaucoma surgery, is not necessary because the patient's glaucoma is currently under control. Option C, performing YAG capsulotomy, is a procedure that is used to open the posterior capsule of the lens. This procedure is not necessary in the patient's case because the posterior capsule is already open.

 10%|█         | 156/1525 [36:12<5:15:05, 13.81s/it]The correct answer is: **B. Obtain information about the immunotherapy protocol initiated for her sarcoma.**

The patient's history of clear cell sarcoma with metastatic disease and recent enrollment in a palliative immunotherapy research protocol is highly suggestive of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), a potentially reversible condition that can occur in patients receiving immunotherapy. PRES is characterized by headache, seizures, hypertension, and visual disturbances, including blurry vision.

The most common treatment for PRES is to stop the offending agent, in this case the immunotherapy. However, it is important to obtain information about the specific immunotherapy protocol that the patient is receiving in order to determine whether there are any other potential treatments or interventions that may be beneficial.

Obtaining information about the patient's prior radiation therapy is not necessary in this case, as radiation therapy is not a known risk factor for PRES. Close observation is also not an appropriate management strategy, as PRES can be a life-threatening condition.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to obtain information about the immunotherapy protocol initiated for the patient's sarcoma. This information will help to determine the best course of treatment for her PRES.

Multicentric Castleman disease is a rare, lymphoproliferative disorder characterized by the proliferation of B cells and plasma cells in lymph nodes. It can present with a variety of symptoms, including fever, night sweats, weight loss, fatigue, and lymphadenopathy. The diagnosis is made based on a biopsy of an enlarged lymph node. Treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.

The patient in the case presented with a number of features that are consistent with multicentric Castleman disease, including:

* Bilateral cervical, axillary, and inguinal lymphadenopathy
* Elevated levels of interleukin (IL) 10, IL-6, C-reactive protein, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate
* Positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET/CT) scan demonstrating fluorodeoxyglucose-avid lymph nodes above and below the diaphragm
* Excision biopsy of an enlarged right cervical lymph node showing proliferation of slitlike blood vessels and regression of the lymphoid follicle, with onion-skinning of mantle zone lymphocytes and hypervascularity

The other possible diagnoses listed in the question are less likely in this case. Extrapulmonary tuberculosis is a bacterial infection that can cause lymphadenopathy, but it is typically seen in patients with a history of tuberculosis or who have been exposed to the disease. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that can also cause lymphadenopathy, but it is typically seen in patients who are older than the patient in the case. Sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can cause lymphadenopathy, but it is typically seen in patients who are younger than the patient in the case.

In conclusion, the patient in the case most likely has multicentric Castleman disease. This diagnosis is supported by the patient's clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging studies.

Explanation:

The patient is an adolescent girl with a slowly growing, asymptomatic verrucous plaque on the right temple. The lesion is nontender and has no purulent discharge or severe necrotic changes. There is no hepatosplenomegaly or superficial lymphadenopathy. Laboratory tests are unremarkable. A skin biopsy shows papillomatous epidermal hyperplasia, edema of dermal papillae, and neoplastic infiltration consisting of small round blue cells with alternating areas of dense and loose cellularity. The cells are positive for MyoD1.

These findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of primary cutaneous embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (PNET). PNET is a rare, aggressive soft tissue sarcoma that typically occurs in children and young adults. It is thought to arise from primitive mesenchymal cells that have the potential to differentiate into skeletal muscle cells. The most common presentation is a rapidly growing, painless mass on the skin. PNET can also occur in other soft tissues, such as the muscles, bones, and viscera.

The diagnosis of PNET is made based on clinical findings, imaging studies, and histopathologic examination of a biopsy specimen. Imaging studies, such as CT scan or MRI, can help to determine the extent of the disease. Histopathologic examination shows a proliferation of small, round blue cells with scant cytoplasm and round, hyperchromatic nuclei. The cells are positive for MyoD1, a marker of skeletal muscle differentiation.

The treatment of PNET is based on the stage of disease. Patients with localized disease are treated with surgery and radiation therapy. Patients with metastatic disease are treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The prognosis for patients with PNET is poor, with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 50%.

The other options are incorrect because they do not explain the clinical findings in this case. Superficial lymphatic malformation is a benign condition that typically presents as a soft, compressible mass. Lymphoblastic lymphoma is a type of leukemia that typically presents with lymphadenopathy, fever, and weight loss. Primary cutaneous embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma is a rare, aggressive soft tissue sarcoma that typically presents as a rapidly growing, painless mass on the skin.

Explanation:
The patient has a long-standing history of poorly controlled HIV, with a CD4 count of 40 cells/mm3. This places him at high risk for opportunistic infections, including Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The perianal ulcers are consistent with EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcers, which are a well-recognized manifestation of EBV infection in immunocompromised patients. The biopsy findings of a mixed infiltrate of histiocytes, neutrophils, lymphocytes, and eosinophils, with prominent admixed large and atypical cells at high power, are also consistent with EBV infection. In contrast, chronic ulcerative herpes simplex virus is not typically associated with a mixed infiltrate of inflammatory cells, and Crohn disease associated with pyostomatitis vegetans is typically seen in patients with Crohn disease, not HIV. Ulcers secondary to fungal infection are also less likely in this patient, given his high CD4 count and the lack of other evidence of systemic fungal infection.

 10%|█         | 160/1525 [37:08<5:27:51, 14.41s/it]The correct answer is: C. Pituitary apoplexy.

Pituitary apoplexy is a sudden, often dramatic, event that occurs when a pituitary tumor hemorrhages or undergoes infarction. It is a medical emergency that can lead to blindness, coma, and death.

The most common symptom of pituitary apoplexy is headache, which is often severe and sudden in onset. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, visual disturbances, and changes in consciousness.

The diagnosis of pituitary apoplexy is based on the patient's history and physical examination, as well as imaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Treatment of pituitary apoplexy is aimed at controlling the hemorrhage and preventing complications. This may include surgery, medications, and supportive care.

Orbital compartment syndrome is a rare but serious condition that occurs when the pressure inside the orbit increases to a dangerously high level. This can happen due to a number of factors, including trauma, infection, and tumors. Orbital compartment syndrome can cause a number of serious problems, including blindness, loss of vision, and death.

Ocular motor apraxia is a condition that affects the ability to move the eyes voluntarily. It is caused by damage to the brainstem, cerebellum, or the nerves that control eye movement. Ocular motor apraxia can make it difficult to read, drive, and perform other activities that require eye movement.

Cavernous sinus thrombosis is a rare but serious infection of the cavernous sinus, a large venous sinus in the skull. It is caused by bacteria that enter the bloodstream and travel to the cavernous sinus. Cavernous sinus thrombosis can cause a number of serious problems, including blindness, loss of vision, and death.

In this case, the patient has a known history of a pituitary macroadenoma. He developed headache, facial numbness, inability to open both his eyes, and inability to move both eyes in any direction after an 8.5-hour robotic cystectomy for small cell cancer of the bladder. These symptoms are consistent with pituitary apoplexy. The MRI findings of a large sellar mass with loss of central enhancement after symptom onset are also consistent with pituitary apoplexy.

Orbital compartment syndrome, ocular motor apraxia, and cavernous sinus thrombosis are all possible diagnoses in this case. However, they are less likely than pituitary apoplexy based on the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging studies. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is pituitary apoplexy.

The patient has a history of intravenous heroin use, which is a risk factor for hepatitis delta virus (HDV) infection. HDV is a defective virus that cannot replicate on its own and requires hepatitis B virus (HBV) to replicate. The patient also has chronic HBV infection, which is a risk factor for HDV infection.

The patient's presentation is consistent with HDV infection. She has sudden onset of painless jaundice and malaise, which are common symptoms of HDV infection. She also has scleral icterus, which is a sign of jaundice.

The patient's laboratory results are consistent with HDV infection. Her liver enzyme values are elevated, which is a common finding in HDV infection. She also has a positive anti-HDV IgM antibody, which is a serological marker of acute HDV infection.

The patient's liver ultrasound is normal, which is a reassuring finding. However, it is important to note that liver ultrasound findings can be normal in patients with HDV infection.

Therefore, the next step in the management of this patient is to order testing for hepatitis delta virus (HDV) IgM and IgG antibodies and, if positive, test for HDV RNA. This will help to confirm the diagnosis of HDV infection and to assess the severity of the infection.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Check plasma HIV-1 RNA level is incorrect because the patient's history and presentation are not suggestive of HIV infection.
* B. Order testing for hepatitis E virus IgM antibody is incorrect because the patient does not have a history of travel outside the US and has not ingested raw meat.
* C. Order testing for anti–smooth muscle antibody is incorrect because anti–smooth muscle antibody is not a serological marker of HDV infection.

The patient has a history of recurrent eye and ear pain, as well as a 9-kg weight loss over the past 3 months. He also has a cough and erythema of the left sclera and ear. These findings are concerning for a possible autoimmune disorder, such as Wegener's granulomatosis. Wegener's granulomatosis is a systemic vasculitis that can affect the lungs, kidneys, and other organs. It is characterized by necrotizing granulomas in the affected tissues.

The diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis is made based on a combination of clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The gold standard for diagnosis is a biopsy of affected tissue, which shows the presence of granulomas.

In this case, the patient's history and physical examination are suggestive of Wegener's granulomatosis. The laboratory tests show an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, which are non-specific markers of inflammation. The chest radiograph is normal, but this does not rule out Wegener's granulomatosis, as the lungs are not always affected early in the disease.

The next step in the evaluation is to perform a biopsy of the left ear. This will provide definitive diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis and allow for initiation of treatment. Treatment for Wegener's granulomatosis includes high-dose corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Chest radiography and pulmonary function testing (PFT) are not necessary in this case. The patient's chest radiograph is normal, and there is no evidence of pulmonary involvement on clinical examination.
* Option C: Prednisone is a corticosteroid that can be used to treat Wegener's granulomatosis. However, it is not the first-line treatment. The first-line treatment is cyclophosphamide.
* Option D: Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug that can be used to treat pain. However, it is not appropriate for this patient because he has a systemic vasculitis.

SFEMG is a test that measures the electrical activity of individual muscle fibers. It is used to diagnose disorders of the neuromuscular junction, such as myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder that causes the immune system to attack the acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction. This can lead to muscle weakness and fatigue, which can be worse at night and with fatigue.

In this case, the patient has a history of hyperlipidemia, hypothyroidism, and chronic migraines. These conditions can increase the risk of developing myasthenia gravis. The patient also has a history of progressively worsening left-sided ptosis, which is more notable at night and with fatigue. These are all symptoms of myasthenia gravis.

SFEMG is the most sensitive test for diagnosing myasthenia gravis. It can help to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms. If the patient is diagnosed with myasthenia gravis, there are several treatment options available. These include medications, surgery, and plasmapheresis.

The other answers are incorrect because:

* **A. Perform left upper eyelid ptosis repair** is not the best next step because the patient's ptosis may be caused by a neuromuscular disorder, such as myasthenia gravis. Ptosis repair would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.
* **C. Biopsy the left levator palpebrae superioris** is not the best next step because the patient's ptosis may be caused by a neuromuscular disorder, such as myasthenia gravis. A biopsy would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.
* **D. Obtain orbital imaging with intravenous contrast** is not the best next step because the patient's ptosis may be caused by a neuromuscular disorder, such as myasthenia gravis. Orbital imaging would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

Explanation:
The patient presents with a 3-week history of sudden onset of headache, nausea, and binocular vertical diplopia. She denied any other neurologic symptoms. Her medical history included untreated hyperprolactinemia manifested by galactorrhea and oligomenorrhea. She did not take any medications, smoke, or drink alcohol. On examination, visual acuity was 20/20 in each eye. There was no relative afferent pupillary defect. There was minimal limitation in infraduction in the left eye with corresponding left hypertropia, which was worse in left gaze and right head tilt. Ophthalmoscopy findings were normal in each eye. Visual field findings (Humphrey 24-2 algorithm) were normal in each eye as well.

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is thyroid eye disease (TED). TED is an autoimmune disorder that affects the muscles and tissues around the eyes. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including double vision, eyelid swelling, and proptosis (bulging of the eyes). TED is often associated with hyperthyroidism, but it can also occur in people with normal thyroid function.

The initial treatment for TED is usually with steroids. Steroids can help to reduce inflammation and swelling around the eyes. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to correct double vision or to remove excess orbital fat.

The differential diagnosis for TED includes other causes of double vision, such as a stroke, a brain tumor, or a migraine headache. However, the patient's history and physical examination are most consistent with TED.

The next step in the management of this patient is to check her thyrotropin and thyroid receptor autoantibody levels. These tests can help to confirm the diagnosis of TED and to determine if she has an underlying autoimmune disorder. The patient should also have an orbital imaging study, such as an MRI or CT scan, to rule out other causes of her double vision.

Acetylcholine receptor antibody level titers are not necessary in this patient because she does not have any symptoms of myasthenia gravis, a disorder that can also cause double vision. A lumbar puncture is not necessary in this patient because she does not have any symptoms of meningitis, a serious infection of the meninges.

The patient has a unilateral intraocular lens implant subluxation in the right eye. The most likely cause of this is a posterior capsular tear, which can occur spontaneously or after trauma. The subluxation of the intraocular lens is causing progressive vision loss in the right eye. The patient also has a superonasal area of pigmentation on the sclera, which could be a nevus or a melanoma. However, the most important issue is the subluxation of the intraocular lens, which needs to be addressed urgently to prevent further vision loss. The options for treatment include suture fixation of the intraocular lens to the iris or sclera, or exchange of the intraocular lens. Suture fixation is a less invasive procedure, but it may not be possible if the capsular tear is too large. Exchange of the intraocular lens is a more invasive procedure, but it is more likely to be successful in restoring vision.

Ultrasound biomicroscopy and anterior segment optical coherence tomography are useful for diagnosing and evaluating the cause of the subluxation, but they will not improve the patient's vision. A biopsy of the ocular surface lesion is not necessary at this time, as it is not the cause of the patient's vision loss.

Therefore, the best option is to perform intraocular lens suture fixation or exchange.

Explanation: The patient has a history of rubbing his eyes, which is a risk factor for herpes simplex keratitis. The patient also has bilateral corneal epithelial defects, which are a classic presentation of herpes simplex keratitis. The patient's visual acuity cannot be determined, which suggests that the corneal ulcers are severe. Corneal herpes simplex viral cultures are the most definitive way to diagnose herpes simplex keratitis. If the cultures are positive, the patient can be treated with antiviral medications. Early diagnosis and treatment of herpes simplex keratitis can prevent permanent vision loss.

A. Perform allergy testing and initiate topical steroids is incorrect because the patient's history and presentation are more consistent with herpes simplex keratitis than with an allergic reaction. Topical steroids can worsen herpes simplex keratitis.

B. Check serum vitamin A levels is incorrect because vitamin A deficiency is not a common cause of corneal ulcers.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms are most consistent with superior semicircular canal dehiscence syndrome (SSCD). SSCD is a rare condition that occurs when there is a small opening in the bony labyrinth of the inner ear. This can allow fluid or air to leak into the inner ear, which can cause symptoms such as vertigo, hearing loss, and tinnitus.

The patient in this case presents with a 24-hour history of severe dizziness that she described as “room spinning,” right aural fullness, and a subjective right-sided hearing loss. She denied any medical history of vertigo, recent upper respiratory infection, head trauma, or prior otologic surgery.

On physical examination, there were no abnormalities on otoscopic evaluation; however, a strongly positive right-sided Dix−Hallpike test was elicited with rotary nystagmus; a subsequent Epley maneuver was performed. The patient’s symptoms subjectively worsened during the following several days. Therefore, an audiogram test (Figure 1) and computed tomography (CT) of the temporal bone were performed.

The audiogram shows a right-sided low- to mid-frequency moderate conductive hearing loss and a bilateral high-frequency sensorineural hearing loss. The CT scan of the temporal bone shows a small dehiscence in the superior semicircular canal on the right side.

All of these findings are consistent with the diagnosis of SSCD. The Epley maneuver is a treatment that is sometimes used to treat SSCD. It involves a series of head movements that are designed to move the debris that is causing the symptoms out of the inner ear.

The patient in this case did not improve with the Epley maneuver. She may need further treatment, such as surgery, to correct the dehiscence in her inner ear.

The other possible diagnoses are not as likely in this case. Labyrinthitis is an inflammation of the inner ear that can cause vertigo, hearing loss, and tinnitus. However, labyrinthitis is usually caused by a viral infection, and the patient in this case denied any recent upper respiratory infection. Meniere disease is a condition that causes episodes of vertigo, hearing loss, and tinnitus. However, Meniere disease is usually associated with a fluctuating hearing loss, and the patient in this case has a stable hearing loss. Pneumolabyrinth is a condition that occurs when air leaks into the inner ear. This can cause vertigo, hearing loss, and tinnitus. However, pneumolabyrinth is usually associated with a sudden onset of symptoms, and the patient in this case has a 24-hour history of symptoms.

 11%|█         | 168/1525 [38:56<4:44:33, 12.58s/it]The correct answer is: **B. Parathyroid cyst**

Explanation:

The patient is a young male with a slowly progressive painless lateral neck mass on the right side. The mass moved with swallowing and was found to be intrathyroidal on neck CT scan. The patient had normal thyroid stimulating hormone and calcium levels and a parathyroid hormone (PTH) level of 63 pg/mL. A near-infrared autofluorescence (NIRAF) camera yielded a homogenously dim lesion. Pathologic examination confirmed a normal right thyroid lobe, a normal right parathyroid gland, and a cystic lesion at the inferior pole with no evidence of malignant disease in the specimen. The tissue inside the lesion stained positive for PTH.

Given the above information, the most likely diagnosis is parathyroid cyst. Parathyroid cysts are rare, benign lesions that occur in the parathyroid glands. They are typically asymptomatic but can cause symptoms if they are large enough to compress surrounding structures. Parathyroid cysts are usually diagnosed on imaging studies, such as neck CT scan or MRI. Treatment is usually surgical excision.

The other possible diagnoses are:

* Benign thyroid nodule: Benign thyroid nodules are common, especially in older adults. They are usually asymptomatic but can cause symptoms if they are large enough to compress surrounding structures. Benign thyroid nodules are usually diagnosed on imaging studies, such as neck ultrasound or CT scan. Treatment is usually observation or surgery, depending on the size and symptoms of the nodule.
* Reactive viral lymphadenopathy: Reactive viral lymphadenopathy is a common condition that occurs when the lymph nodes become enlarged in response to a viral infection. The lymph nodes are usually soft, tender, and movable. Reactive viral lymphadenopathy usually resolves on its own within a few weeks.
* Thyroglossal duct cyst: Thyroglossal duct cysts are rare, congenital anomalies that occur when the thyroglossal duct fails to close during fetal development. They are usually located in the midline of the neck, just below the hyoid bone. Thyroglossal duct cysts can be asymptomatic or can cause symptoms such as a neck mass, pain, or infection. Treatment is usually surgical excision.

Explanation: The patient is a 53-year-old woman with a history of coronary artery disease and prior myocardial infarction that is treated with warfarin. She denied any personal or family history of cancer. She was previously briefly a smoker. A physical examination revealed no erythema or tenderness of the parotid. Her cranial nerves were intact, specifically the right facial nerve and its branches. The oral mucosa was intact with no epithelial lesions. Urinalysis results revealed slight hematuria. Her international normalized ratio (INR) was 4.4. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed an ill-defined infiltrative mass centered in the deep lobe of the right parotid with extension into surrounding soft tissue spaces. A follow-up CT was performed 6 weeks later, which showed that the mass had enlarged.

The most likely diagnosis is primary parotid gland cancer. This is supported by the patient's age, history of smoking, and the presence of an ill-defined infiltrative mass on CT scan. The mass is also concerning for malignancy because it is centered in the deep lobe of the parotid gland, which is where most parotid gland cancers occur. The fact that the mass has enlarged on follow-up CT scan also supports the diagnosis of cancer.

Parotid gland lymphoma is a less likely diagnosis. This is because lymphoma is more common in younger people and is not typically associated with a history of smoking. Lymphoma is also more likely to present with lymphadenopathy than with a parotid gland mass.

Parotid gland hemorrhage is also a less likely diagnosis. This is because hemorrhage is typically associated with trauma or anticoagulation therapy. The patient in this case does not have a history of trauma and is not taking anticoagulation therapy.

Benign parotid gland tumor is the least likely diagnosis. This is because benign tumors are typically well-defined and do not infiltrate surrounding tissues. The mass in this case is ill-defined and infiltrative, which suggests malignancy.

Explanation:

The correct answer is C: Lipodystrophia centrifugalis abdominalis infantilis.

Lipodystrophia centrifugalis abdominalis infantilis (LAFI) is a rare, self-limited disorder of unknown etiology characterized by progressive atrophy of subcutaneous fat in the abdomen, back, and buttocks. It typically presents in infants and young children, and is more common in girls. The lesions are usually asymptomatic, but may be associated with pruritus or pain. The diagnosis is made clinically, and there is no specific treatment. LAFI typically resolves spontaneously within a few years.

The patient in the case presented with a 10-month history of asymptomatic skin depressions in her neck, nape, and submandibular regions. The lesion initially occurred as an erythema in the neck and progressed centrifugally to the nape and submandibular areas. Atrophy was observed in the center of the lesion, surrounded by an erythematous border, with underlying blood vessels being visible deep to the atrophy. These findings are consistent with LAFI.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Morphea is a chronic, inflammatory disorder of the skin characterized by fibrosis of the dermis and subcutaneous fat. It typically presents as well-demarcated, indurated plaques on the skin. Morphea is more common in women than men, and typically occurs in adults.
* Lupus panniculitis is a rare, inflammatory disorder of the subcutaneous fat. It typically presents as tender, erythematous nodules on the skin. Lupus panniculitis is more common in women than men, and typically occurs in adults.
* Subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn is a rare, self-limited disorder of unknown etiology characterized by necrosis of subcutaneous fat in the newborn. It typically presents as firm, subcutaneous nodules on the skin. Subcutaneous fat necrosis of the newborn is more common in premature infants, and is associated with low birth weight and maternal diabetes.

Explanation:
The patient is a woman in her 40s who presented with painful erythematous plaques on her trunk. The skin lesions developed 2 months earlier and progressively spread. She reported abdominal discomfort, weight loss, and vaginal bleeding. A solid mass on her lower abdomen that had been palpable about 10 years prior had rapidly increased in size within the past few months. Physical examination revealed erythematous plaques on the right chest and flank without warmth. Punch biopsy of a lesion from the chest was sent for histopathological examination.

The histopathological examination revealed large atypical cells with clear or eosinophilic cytoplasm forming papillary and glandular architectures are present in the deep dermis; lymphovascular invasion was observed in the superficial and deep dermis. This finding is consistent with metastatic carcinoma.

The patient's history of a solid mass on her lower abdomen that had been palpable about 10 years prior and had rapidly increased in size within the past few months is also consistent with metastatic carcinoma.

The other options are not as likely in this case. Interstitial granulomatous dermatitis is a rare inflammatory skin disease that is characterized by the presence of interstitial granulomas in the dermis. It is not typically associated with abdominal discomfort, weight loss, or vaginal bleeding. Wolf isotopic response is a rare condition that is characterized by the development of skin lesions in response to the administration of radioactive isotopes. It is not typically associated with abdominal discomfort, weight loss, or vaginal bleeding. Cutaneous endometriosis is a condition in which endometrial tissue implants in the skin. It is not typically associated with abdominal discomfort, weight loss, or vaginal bleeding.

The patient has a history of progressive parkinsonism with poor levodopa response, unexplained sensory hearing loss, hyperlipidemia, and osteoarthritis. He also has features of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, restless legs syndrome (RLS), visual daytime hallucinations, and rapid cognitive decline. He was given levodopa/benserazide (up to 200 mg/50 mg 4 times daily) without improvement on his Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale scores. Therefore, his dopaminergic medication was ceased. Family history was negative for movement or developmental disorders. His neurologic examination showed hypomimia, symmetrical bradykinesia, and rigidity of the extremities without tremors. There was full range of eye movements with large-amplitude saccadic intrusions on smooth pursuit in all directions. Neuropsychological assessment revealed significant abnormalities in cognitive functioning, affecting verbal and nonverbal cognitive skills (ie, speed of information processing, visuospatial skills, verbal and visual memory loss, executive skills). Mini-Mental Status Examination score was 26 of 30 points. Systemic examination was unremarkable. Laboratory and cerebral spinal fluid testing (ie, paraneoplastic antibodies Hu, Yo, Ri, CV2, Ma2, amphiphysin, glutamic acid decarboxylase, N-methyl-d-aspartic acid, LGI1, and Caspr2, 14-3-3 protein) were normal. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed mild frontal and parietal atrophy. An electroencephalogram demonstrated slowing in keeping with moderate generalized encephalopathy. Total-body positron emission tomography (PET) using fluorine 18 (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) as a tracer showed no FDG-avid lesions; however, a subsequent brain-specific FDG-PET/MRI revealed hypometabolism throughout the left cerebral hemisphere and crossed cerebellar diaschisis (Figure 1). As the patient’s cognitive function and parkinsonism had deteriorated rapidly, a brain biopsy of the left frontal cortex was done. Immunohistochemistry showed scattered globular inclusions consistent with Lewy bodies.

The patient's presentation is consistent with MELAS, which is a mitochondrial disorder characterized by encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes. MELAS is caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA, and is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The clinical features of MELAS are variable, but typically include seizures, developmental delay, strokelike episodes, and lactic acidosis. The diagnosis of MELAS is confirmed by genetic testing. There is no cure for MELAS, but treatment is aimed at managing the symptoms. Treatment may include anticonvulsants, steroids, and supportive care.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive supranuclear gaze palsy, axial rigidity, and falls. PSP is not typically associated with cognitive decline or sensory hearing loss.
* Autosomal recessive parkinsonism (ARP) is a group of genetic disorders characterized by parkinsonism. ARP is not typically associated with cognitive decline, sensory hearing loss, or lactic acidosis.
* Paraneoplastic syndrome is a condition that occurs when a tumor produces antibodies that attack the body's own tissues. Paraneoplastic syndromes can affect the nervous system, and can present with symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease. However, paraneoplastic syndromes are typically associated with other symptoms, such as fever, weight loss, and fatigue.

Explanation:
The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with Sweet syndrome, a neutrophilic dermatosis that is often associated with underlying malignancy. The most common malignancies associated with Sweet syndrome are hematologic malignancies, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Other malignancies that have been associated with Sweet syndrome include solid tumors, such as lung cancer, breast cancer, and colon cancer.

The patient's laboratory findings are also consistent with Sweet syndrome. The elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level are non-specific findings that can be seen in a variety of inflammatory conditions. The anemia is likely due to the underlying malignancy. The DVT is a potential complication of Sweet syndrome, and it is important to rule out other causes of DVT, such as malignancy or infection.

The punch biopsies of the scalp and left hand show a dense dermal neutrophilic infiltrate with marked edema without vasculitis. This is a characteristic finding of Sweet syndrome. The absence of organisms on special stains for bacteria, fungi, and acid-fast organisms suggests that the patient does not have an infectious dermatosis.

The next step in the management of this patient is to perform a bone marrow biopsy with flow cytometry and cytogenetics. This will help to determine if the patient has an underlying malignancy. If the patient does have an underlying malignancy, the treatment will be directed at the malignancy. If the patient does not have an underlying malignancy, the treatment of Sweet syndrome will be supportive and symptomatic.

Options A, C, and D are incorrect because they are not the next step in the management of this patient. Option A, obtaining blood cultures and starting intravenous vancomycin, is not necessary because the patient does not have an infection. Option C, performing incision and drainage of the skin lesions, is not necessary because the skin lesions are not infected. Option D, prescribing oral dapsone, is not a first-line treatment for Sweet syndrome.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of delayed-type hypersensitivity to the COVID-19 mRNA booster vaccine. The most common delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction to vaccines is urticaria, which is characterized by pruritic wheals that resolve within 24 hours. The patient's rash is consistent with this diagnosis.

The patient should be advised to carry a preloaded epinephrine autoinjector at all times in case of anaphylaxis. She should also be referred for allergy testing to confirm the diagnosis and to identify other potential allergens. If the allergy testing is positive, the patient may need to avoid future COVID-19 mRNA vaccinations.

The other answers are incorrect because:

* Answer A: Advise the patient against future COVID-19 mRNA vaccination because of allergy is incorrect because the patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of delayed-type hypersensitivity, which is a type of hypersensitivity reaction that is not usually associated with anaphylaxis.
* Answer C: Prescribe a nonsedating antihistamine at a standard dose and increase to high-dose antihistamine if symptoms persist is incorrect because nonsedating antihistamines are not effective in treating delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions.
* Answer D: Prescribe oral prednisone (60 mg per day for 5 days) is incorrect because oral prednisone is not indicated for the treatment of delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions.

 11%|█▏        | 175/1525 [40:36<5:28:05, 14.58s/it]Answer: C. Recurrent parotid tumor

Explanation: The patient has a history of a Warthin tumor of the parotid gland that was resected 10 years ago. He now presents with a painful lump in the same area. The lump is associated with focal tenderness and is located deep to the neck wound along the mid sternocleidomastoid muscle. The facial nerve function is normal and sensation in the ear lobe is intact. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan shows no focal lesion in either parotid gland or at the area of interest over the left sternocleidomastoid muscle. These findings are consistent with a recurrent parotid tumor.

Reactive lymphoid hyperplasia is a common finding in the neck and is usually not associated with pain. It would not be expected to be located deep to the neck wound along the mid sternocleidomastoid muscle.

A greater auricular nerve neuroma is a rare lesion that can occur after trauma to the nerve. It would not be expected to be associated with pain and would not be located deep to the neck wound along the mid sternocleidomastoid muscle.

Metastatic tumor deposit is a possibility, but it is less likely than recurrent parotid tumor given the patient's history and the findings on physical examination and imaging.

Explanation:
The patient has a history of multiple ocular surgeries, including a scleral buckle, silicone oil injection, and an Ahmed valve implant. The patient also has a large, firm, pink subconjunctival mass inferotemporally near the Ahmed valve. The most likely diagnosis is a granulomatous reaction to the silicone oil. The treatment of choice is transscleral cyclophotocoagulation and removal of the mass and Ahmed valve. Bleb revision with excision of the mass is not appropriate because it would not address the underlying cause of the granulomatous reaction. Fine-needle aspiration of the mass is not appropriate because it would not provide a definitive diagnosis and could potentially spread the granulomatous reaction. Silicone oil removal from the vitreous cavity is not appropriate because it would not address the underlying cause of the granulomatous reaction and could potentially precipitate a retinal detachment.

The patient has anemia and leukopenia, which are both symptoms of bone marrow disorders. The elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level suggest an inflammatory process, which could be due to a bone marrow disorder. The papilledema is a sign of increased intracranial pressure, which can be caused by a number of conditions, including tumors, infections, and blood clots. However, the MRI of the brain and orbits with and without contrast and lumbar puncture did not reveal any of these conditions. The bone marrow biopsy is the most likely test to identify the underlying cause of the patient's anemia, leukopenia, and papilledema.

A: Repeat serial ophthalmic examinations would not be helpful in diagnosing the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

B: Diagnosing and treating idiopathic intracranial hypertension would be premature, as there is no evidence that the patient has this condition.

D: Repeat serial lumbar punctures would not be helpful in diagnosing the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with myasthenia gravis (MG), an autoimmune disorder that causes fluctuating weakness of the skeletal muscles, including the muscles of the eye. The improvement in ptosis after application of an ice pack is a classic finding in MG, as it is a result of temporary cooling of the muscles, which reduces their activity.

A serum test for autoantibodies against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) is the most sensitive and specific test for MG. However, it is important to note that a negative test does not rule out the diagnosis, as up to 20% of patients with MG have negative AChR antibodies.

A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbit is useful to rule out other causes of ptosis, such as a brain tumor or a mass lesion in the orbit. It can also help to identify any abnormalities in the muscles of the eye, which can be seen in patients with MG.

Revision ptosis repair is not indicated at this time, as the patient's ptosis is likely due to MG, which is a treatable condition. Symptomatic management with a cholinesterase inhibitor, such as pyridostigmine, can help to improve the patient's symptoms. However, it is important to note that cholinesterase inhibitors do not cure MG, and they can have side effects, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is to order a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbit.

The patient has a 6-week history of blurry vision, ocular pain, and subconjunctival yellow discoloration in the left eye. Suspicious retinal detachment and intraocular mass were identified, which raised concerns for choroidal melanoma. No symptoms or signs were reported in the right eye. Her ocular history included bilateral cataract surgery 5 years prior. Review of systems yielded negative results, including for ocular trauma, jaundice, and cutaneous melanoma. She had no history of tobacco use.

On examination of the left eye, visual acuity was hand motion, and intraocular pressure was 8 mm Hg. The anterior segment showed diffuse conjunctival chemosis of yellow hue, low-grade aqueous reaction, and pseudophakia. On the fundus evaluation, large pockets of subretinal fluid suggested choroidal effusion based on marked fluid shifting with head position. B-scan ultrasonography confirmed 4-quadrant choroidal hemorrhage and partially mobile serous retinal detachment. B-scans also exhibited a solid lesion from the 6- to 10-o’clock meridians with irregular shape and variable internal reflectivity, measuring 5.8 mm in height. Magnetic resonance imaging was requested to delineate the mass from the surrounding clot. In the interim, she received oral steroids aiming to contain the abundant exudation and topical atropine for pain, evolving with minimal clinical improvement on these features.

The differential diagnosis for a choroidal mass includes choroidal melanoma, choroidal hemangioma, choroidal metastasis, and choroidal lymphoma. Choroidal melanoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy, accounting for approximately 5% of all melanomas. It is a malignancy of melanocytes, the cells that produce melanin. Choroidal melanoma can present with a variety of symptoms, including blurred vision, floaters, pain, and redness. The most common sign of choroidal melanoma is a pigmented lesion in the fundus. Choroidal melanoma can be diagnosed with a variety of imaging tests, including B-scan ultrasonography, CT scan, and MRI. Treatment for choroidal melanoma depends on the size, location, and stage of the tumor. Treatment options include observation, radiation therapy, and surgery.

In this case, the patient has a choroidal mass that is suspicious for melanoma. The most important next step is to rule out an occult systemic neoplasm. This can be done with a complete physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. If an occult systemic neoplasm is found, treatment will be directed at the primary tumor. If no occult systemic neoplasm is found, then treatment for the choroidal melanoma can be considered.

The other options are not correct because they do not address the most important next step in the management of this patient. Option A, to investigate liver dysfunction and biliary tract obstruction, is not necessary because there is no evidence of liver dysfunction or biliary tract obstruction in this patient. Option B, to drain the hemorrhage with scleral windows, is not appropriate because the hemorrhage is not causing any symptoms and it is not likely to improve visual acuity. Option C, to treat with plaque brachytherapy, is not appropriate because the patient has a choroidal melanoma that is not suitable for treatment with plaque brachytherapy.

The patient's history of high-grade leiomyosarcoma of the uterus, with liver and spine metastases, as well as her recent treatment with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) to T2 to T3 and palliative radiation therapy (20 Gy/5 fractions) to T9 to T12, places her at risk for spinal cord infarct.

Spinal cord infarct is a rare but serious complication of radiation therapy, occurring in approximately 1% of patients who receive thoracic or lumbar radiation. It is thought to be caused by damage to the small blood vessels that supply the spinal cord, leading to ischemia and infarction of the spinal cord tissue.

The patient's presentation with progressive bilateral lower extremity numbness, pain, weakness, and imbalance is consistent with spinal cord infarct. The MRI findings of extensive spinal cord edema extending from T2 to the conus and a posterior ring-enhancing intramedullary lesion at T9 to T10 without any mass effect are also consistent with spinal cord infarct.

The lumbar puncture showed no malignant cells, which makes metastatic progression less likely. The PET/CT scan demonstrated multifocal intensely F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid disease, but only mild uptake from T9 to T12 and no definitive FDG-avidity at the intramedullary lesion. This suggests that the intramedullary lesion is not a metastasis from the patient's leiomyosarcoma.

The patient's symptoms remained stable with steroid treatment, which is supportive care for spinal cord infarct. A plan was made to repeat an MRI of the spine in 6 to 8 weeks to assess for progression of the lesion.

In conclusion, the patient's presentation, imaging findings, and laboratory results are most consistent with spinal cord infarct. The patient should be treated with supportive care, including steroids, and her underlying cause should be investigated.

Explanation:

The most likely diagnosis is trigeminal schwannoma. This is a benign tumor that arises from the Schwann cells that surround the trigeminal nerve. It is the most common type of nerve sheath tumor in the head and neck, and it typically occurs in adults over the age of 50. The most common symptoms are facial pain, paresthesia, and weakness in the muscles of the face. On physical examination, there may be a mass in the infratemporal fossa. Imaging studies such as MRI or CT scan can help to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment typically involves surgical removal of the tumor.

The other options are less likely diagnoses. An encephalocele is a protrusion of brain tissue through a defect in the skull. It is most commonly seen in children, and it is usually located in the occipital region of the skull. Deep lobe parotid tumors are rare, and they typically present with facial pain and swelling. Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibromas are tumors that arise from the blood vessels in the nasopharynx. They are most common in adolescent boys, and they typically present with nasal obstruction and epistaxis.

Explanation:

The patient presented with symmetrical white and transparent papules, white keratosis, and excessive wrinkling on the dorsum of hands after water immersion. The lesions worsened in summer and remitted in winter. He was treated with topical tretinoin ointment intermittently per a diagnosis of chronic eczema at the local clinic with little improvement. The lesions gradually aggravated, and the affected area dispersed to wrists and elbows during the past 1.5 years. He attributed these changes to the need for washing hands frequently in the period of the COVID-19 epidemic. He had no family history of similar skin problems and did not have a history of hyperhidrosis, cystic fibrosis, atopy, or trauma to the hands.

Physical examination showed some changes emerged on both hands after water immersion contrasting with any other condition. A skin biopsy specimen from white papules on the right hand showed hyperkeratosis, dilated eccrine ducts in the epidermis and dermis, and hyperplasia of the eccrine sweat glands.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of aquagenic syringeal acrokeratoderma (ASA). ASA is a rare, acquired, chronic, and progressive skin disorder characterized by the development of symmetrical, small, white papules on the acral skin (hands, feet, and elbows) after exposure to water. The lesions are thought to be caused by dilation and hyperkeratosis of the eccrine ducts.

Eczema is a common skin condition characterized by dry, itchy skin. It is not caused by water exposure and does not typically present with the symmetrical white papules and excessive wrinkling seen in ASA.

Hereditary papulotranslucent acrokeratoderma is an autosomal dominant skin disorder characterized by the development of small, translucent papules on the palms and soles. It is not caused by water exposure and does not typically present with the symmetrical white papules and excessive wrinkling seen in ASA.

Progressive symmetric erythrokeratoderma is a rare, acquired, chronic, and progressive skin disorder characterized by the development of symmetrical, erythematous plaques on the acral skin. It is not caused by water exposure and does not typically present with the symmetrical white papules and excessive wrinkling seen in ASA.

In conclusion, the patient's presentation is most consistent with a diagnosis of ASA.

Explanation:
The patient in the case presented with acute hypoxic respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19. Following admission, he was intubated with prone positioning, and treatment with tocilizumab and dexamethasone was started. He was also found to have Staphylococcus hemolyticus bacteremia, and treatment with cefepime was initiated. Three days after admission, the patient developed erythema and edematous necrotic plaques of the bilateral ears. No devices had been used on the ears. The necrosis progressed during the following days, primarily involving the earlobe of the right ear and a large portion of the helix of the left ear. A punch biopsy specimen was performed.

The clinical presentation of the patient is consistent with COVID-19−associated acroischemia (thrombotic vasculopathy). This is a rare but well-recognized complication of COVID-19 that can affect the extremities, including the ears. The condition is characterized by ischemia and necrosis of the skin and underlying tissues. The exact mechanism of COVID-19−associated acroischemia is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a combination of microvascular thrombosis and inflammation.

The diagnosis of COVID-19−associated acroischemia is based on the clinical presentation and supportive laboratory findings, such as elevated D-dimer levels. Treatment is supportive and includes measures to improve blood flow to the affected area, such as anticoagulation and vasodilators. In severe cases, amputation may be necessary.

The other options are incorrect. Pressure necrosis is a type of skin damage that occurs when pressure is applied to an area of skin for a prolonged period of time. It is characterized by skin discoloration, blisters, and ulceration. Levamisole-induced vasculitis is a type of autoimmune vasculitis that can be caused by the medication levamisole. It is characterized by inflammation of the blood vessels, which can lead to necrosis of the skin and other tissues. Nonpseudomonal ecthyma gangrenosum is a rare skin infection that is caused by bacteria. It is characterized by necrotic skin lesions that are often associated with fever and systemic symptoms.

Explanation:
The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with systemic sclerosis (SSc), a connective tissue disorder characterized by fibrosis of the skin, lungs, and other organs. SSc is associated with a number of autoantibodies, including anti-topoisomerase I (anti-Scl-70) and anticentromere antibodies. A chest CT scan is a useful test to evaluate for pulmonary fibrosis, which is a common complication of SSc. A myositis-specific autoantibody panel can help to confirm the diagnosis of SSc and to identify the specific type of SSc.

The other options are incorrect because they are not as likely to be helpful in the diagnosis of SSc. Testing for anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) antibody is useful in the diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but it is not specific for SSc. Ordering a muscle biopsy is not necessary in the initial evaluation of a patient with suspected SSc, as the diagnosis can usually be made based on the history, physical examination, and laboratory tests.

The patient has a deep 9 × 8–cm ulcer with a dusky violaceous border extending 2 to 5 cm from the wound edge, with many 1- to 2-mm pustules. Histologic examination of the tissue obtained during the second surgical debridement revealed ulceration with extensive neutrophilic inflammation. These findings are consistent with necrotizing fasciitis, a life-threatening infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. The mainstay of treatment for necrotizing fasciitis is surgical debridement to remove all necrotic tissue. Antibiotics are also used, but they are not as effective as surgical debridement. In this case, the patient has already undergone two surgical debridements, but her condition has not improved. Therefore, she needs further surgical debridement to remove all necrotic tissue and to allow the wound to heal.

A: Adding intravenous amphotericin B is not the best option in this case. Amphotericin B is an antifungal medication that is used to treat fungal infections. Necrotizing fasciitis is caused by bacteria, not fungi. Therefore, amphotericin B would not be effective in treating this infection.

B: Starting hyperbaric oxygen therapy is not the best option in this case. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is a treatment that uses high-pressure oxygen to help heal wounds. It is not effective in treating necrotizing fasciitis.

C: Starting intravenous glucocorticoids is not the best option in this case. Glucocorticoids are medications that suppress the immune system. They are not effective in treating necrotizing fasciitis.

In conclusion, the best option for this patient is further surgical debridement.

Explanation:
The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE is a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organ systems, including the skin, joints, kidneys, heart, and lungs. The most common presenting symptoms of SLE are fatigue, fever, and joint pain. The patient's laboratory findings are also consistent with SLE. The elevated white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein suggest an inflammatory process. The presence of red blood cells and protein in the urine is consistent with kidney disease.

The rapid plasma reagin (RPR) and fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test (FTA-ABS) are serologic tests used to diagnose syphilis. Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection that can cause a variety of symptoms, including skin lesions, joint pain, and neurological problems. The patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with syphilis, and the laboratory findings are not suggestive of syphilis. Therefore, the RPR and FTA-ABS tests are not indicated in this patient.

Conventional angiography of the aorta and renal arteries is a procedure used to visualize the arteries that supply blood to the kidneys. This procedure is typically used to diagnose and treat blockages in the arteries. The patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with blockages in the arteries that supply blood to the kidneys. Therefore, conventional angiography of the aorta and renal arteries is not indicated in this patient.

ANCA titers are used to diagnose ANCA-associated vasculitis, a group of autoimmune diseases that can affect the blood vessels. The patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with ANCA-associated vasculitis. Therefore, ANCA titers are not indicated in this patient.

Antinuclear antibody (ANA) and complement levels are used to diagnose autoimmune diseases. The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with SLE, an autoimmune disease. Therefore, ANA and complement levels are indicated in this patient.

The patient has a history of Crohn disease, and his medication had been changed from infliximab to ustekinumab 6 weeks prior owing to persistent intestinal inflammation. His presentation with bilateral periorbital pain and swelling, diplopia, and pain with extraocular movement is consistent with orbital inflammation. The CT scan showed moderate bilateral lateral rectus muscle enlargement and mild enlargement of the left medial rectus muscle, which is also consistent with orbital inflammation. The biopsy showed a prominent chronic inflammatory process with infiltrates composed of a mixture of epithelioid histiocytes and small-sized lymphocytes associated with severe muscle atrophy. This is also consistent with orbital inflammation.

The patient's symptoms resolved with prednisone therapy, but recurred when the prednisone was weaned. This suggests that the patient's orbital inflammation is steroid-responsive. Therefore, the next step in management is to prescribe long-term prednisone therapy.

Options B and C are incorrect because they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's orbital inflammation. Option D is incorrect because the patient's thyroid function tests and thyroid imaging are normal.

The patient has a history of abnormal retinal findings and mildly decreased visual acuity. She was told about these same findings 10 years ago but did not have a repeated eye examination until recently by another retina specialist. She reported no family history of retinal diseases. She initially received anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment, but was later referred because of a concern about either the idiopathic or paraneoplastic variant of acute exudative polymorphous vitelliform maculopathy (AEPVM). Initial workup by her primary care physician was unremarkable for malignancy.

The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with AEPVM. AEPVM is a rare, idiopathic, inflammatory disorder of the macula that can occur in both children and adults. It is characterized by the development of multiple, yellow, vitelliform lesions in the macula. The lesions typically resolve spontaneously over a period of months to years, but can sometimes cause permanent visual loss.

The differential diagnosis of AEPVM includes other inflammatory conditions of the macula, such as posterior uveitis, multifocal choroiditis and panuveitis, and serpiginous choroiditis. It is important to rule out these other conditions, as they may require different treatment.

In the patient's case, the initial workup by her primary care physician was unremarkable for malignancy. However, given the patient's history and examination findings, it is important to rule out a paraneoplastic cause of AEPVM. A paraneoplastic syndrome is a condition that occurs when a cancer produces antibodies that attack healthy tissue. In the case of AEPVM, the cancer can be located anywhere in the body, but it is most commonly found in the lungs, breasts, or gastrointestinal tract.

The best way to rule out a paraneoplastic cause of AEPVM is to perform a CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. This test will look for any evidence of cancer. If a cancer is found, the patient will need to be treated for the cancer as well as the AEPVM.

Repeat anti-VEGF treatment is not indicated in the patient's case. Anti-VEGF treatment is a treatment option for some types of age-related macular degeneration, but it is not effective for AEPVM.

Genetic testing is not indicated in the patient's case. AEPVM is not a genetic disorder.

Antiretinal antibody testing is not indicated in the patient's case. Antiretinal antibodies are not typically found in patients with AEPVM.

 12%|█▏        | 189/1525 [44:06<5:52:20, 15.82s/it]The correct answer is: D. Perform a clear lens exchange in the left eye.

The patient has a history of angle closure glaucoma in her left eye, which was treated with a laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI). Two weeks later, she developed worsening vision in her left eye, with symptoms of flickering photopsias, temporal scotoma, and a "brown tint" to her vision. On examination, she had subretinal fluid and choroidal detachments in her left eye, but not in her right eye. Systemic corticosteroids failed to resolve the subretinal fluid, and her vision continued to decline.

The most likely cause of the patient's worsening vision is a choroidal effusion. Choroidal effusions are a common complication of LPI, and they can occur in up to 20% of patients. The exact mechanism by which LPI causes choroidal effusions is not fully understood, but it is thought to be due to a disruption of the blood-ocular barrier. Choroidal effusions can lead to subretinal fluid and serous retinal detachments, which can cause visual loss.

The treatment for choroidal effusions is usually conservative, with the use of systemic corticosteroids and/or oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors. However, in some cases, surgical intervention may be necessary. In the patient's case, she has already failed to respond to conservative treatment, and her vision is continuing to decline. Therefore, the best course of treatment is to perform a clear lens exchange in her left eye. A clear lens exchange is a surgical procedure that involves removing the patient's clear lens and replacing it with an artificial lens. This procedure can help to reduce the pressure in the eye and improve the patient's vision.

The other options are not appropriate for this patient. Repeating the LPI in the left eye is unlikely to be effective, as the patient has already had one LPI and the choroidal effusion is likely to have developed due to a disruption of the blood-ocular barrier rather than due to angle closure. Performing an LPI in the right eye is not necessary, as the patient does not have any evidence of angle closure in her right eye. Sclerectomy is a surgical procedure that involves removing a small piece of sclera (the white of the eye) to create a new drainage pathway for aqueous humor. This procedure is usually used to treat chronic angle closure glaucoma, but it is not appropriate for this patient because she does not have chronic angle closure glaucoma.

The patient presents with a multilobulated, serous retinal detachment in both eyes. This is a common presentation of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) syndrome, a systemic autoimmune disorder that can affect the eyes, skin, and central nervous system. VKH syndrome is typically treated with systemic steroids, which can help to reduce inflammation and improve vision.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Option A, performing a diagnostic vitrectomy in the right eye, is not necessary as the diagnosis of VKH syndrome is already suspected. Option B, injecting intravitreal antibiotics for endophthalmitis in both eyes, is not appropriate as there is no evidence of infection. Option C, performing a ciliary body–choroidal biopsy in the right eye, is a more invasive procedure that is typically only performed if the diagnosis of VKH syndrome is uncertain.

In conclusion, the correct answer is: D. Treat the patient with systemic steroids for presumed VKH syndrome.

Explanation:
Sjogren disease is an autoimmune disease that affects the glands that produce tears and saliva. It is characterized by dry eyes, dry mouth, and inflammation of the salivary glands. The patient in the case report presents with bilateral linear oral ulcerations and facial swelling, which are consistent with the symptoms of Sjogren disease. The patient also has a history of depression and prior alcohol use disorder, which are risk factors for Sjogren disease. The biopsy specimen shows noncaseating granulomatous inflammation, which is a characteristic finding of Sjogren disease. Mumps (epidemic parotitis) is a viral infection that causes inflammation of the parotid glands, which are located in the front of the cheeks. Alcoholic sialosis is a condition that causes enlargement of the salivary glands due to alcohol abuse. Crohn disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract. None of these conditions are consistent with the patient's presentation.

 13%|█▎        | 192/1525 [44:45<5:02:14, 13.60s/it]Answer: The correct answer is B. Metastatic colon cancer.

Explanation: The patient is a 64-year-old man with a history of hoarseness for 3 weeks. He has no other medical history or family history of cancer and is not a smoker. On physical examination, there is no lymphadenopathy or oropharyngeal mass. Nasoendoscopy shows left vocal cord palsy. A CT scan shows an ill-defined soft tissue mass in the left supraclavicular fossa, as well as in the prevertebral and paravertebral region. This mass encases the left common carotid, left subclavian, and left vertebral arteries. A PET/CT scan shows increased FDG uptake in the left supraclavicular mass.

These findings are most consistent with metastatic colon cancer. The most common site of metastasis from colon cancer is the liver. However, other sites of metastasis include the lung, bone, brain, and lymph nodes. The left supraclavicular fossa is a common site of metastasis from colon cancer. This is because the left subclavian vein drains the left upper extremity and the left thorax. The left subclavian vein lies adjacent to the left common carotid artery, left subclavian artery, and left vertebral artery. This means that a tumor in the left supraclavicular fossa can easily spread to these arteries.

The patient's hoarseness is likely due to left vocal cord palsy. This is caused by compression of the left recurrent laryngeal nerve by the tumor in the left supraclavicular fossa. The left recurrent laryngeal nerve supplies motor innervation to the left vocal cord. When the left recurrent laryngeal nerve is compressed, the left vocal cord becomes paralyzed. This causes the left vocal cord to remain in a paramedian position. This can lead to hoarseness, breathiness, and a weak cough.

The patient's CT scan shows an ill-defined soft tissue mass in the left supraclavicular fossa. This mass is likely a tumor. The tumor is encasing the left common carotid, left subclavian, and left vertebral arteries. This suggests that the tumor is malignant.

The patient's PET/CT scan shows increased FDG uptake in the left supraclavicular mass. This suggests that the tumor is metabolically active. This is a characteristic of malignant tumors.

In conclusion, the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging studies are most consistent with metastatic colon cancer.

Lichen spinulosus is a chronic, asymptomatic, papular dermatosis characterized by small, spiny papules on the extremities. It is most common in adults, and there is no gender predilection. The cause of lichen spinulosus is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder. The lesions of lichen spinulosus are typically small, skin-colored to yellowish papules that are arranged in an annular or linear pattern. The papules may be follicular or nonfollicular, and they are often surrounded by a collarette of scale. Lichen spinulosus is typically a self-limited disease, but it may persist for several years. Treatment is not always necessary, but topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors may be used to improve the appearance of the lesions.

The other options are incorrect. Multiple minute digitate hyperkeratosis is a rare, benign skin condition characterized by multiple, small, finger-like projections of keratin on the palms and soles. Porokeratosis is a chronic, progressive skin condition characterized by well-demarcated, hyperkeratotic papules on sun-exposed skin. Viral warts are a common, contagious skin infection caused by human papillomavirus (HPV).

The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with nonbullous neutrophilic lupus erythematosus (NMLE), which is a rare, chronic, autoimmune skin disease characterized by the eruption of erythematous, papular, or vesicular lesions on the skin. The lesions are often associated with systemic symptoms, such as fever, arthralgia, and fatigue.

The histopathology of NMLE is characterized by the presence of a perivascular infiltrate of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and eosinophils. The infiltrate is often associated with leukocytoclasia (fragmentation of neutrophils) and fibrinoid necrosis.

The diagnosis of NMLE is made based on the clinical presentation, histopathology, and laboratory findings. The laboratory findings in NMLE may include a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) test, a positive anti-Ro/SSA antibody test, and a positive anti-La/SSB antibody test.

The treatment of NMLE is with systemic corticosteroids. Other treatment options include azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, and mycophenolate mofetil.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not fit the patient's clinical presentation.

* **B: Histiocytoid Sweet syndrome** is a rare, idiopathic, neutrophilic dermatosis characterized by the eruption of tender, erythematous, subcutaneous nodules on the extremities. The lesions are often associated with fever, leukocytosis, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate.

The patient should be urgently evaluated by a cardiovascular surgeon to discuss mitral valve surgery. Transcatheter mitral valve repair is an emerging option for the treatment of mitral regurgitation, but it is not yet widely available and is not without risks.

The patient presented with a blurred spot in the central vision of the right eye, which is consistent with macular edema. Macular edema is a common complication of several eye diseases, including normal-tension glaucoma. In normal-tension glaucoma, the optic nerve is damaged due to high pressure inside the eye, even though the pressure is within the normal range. This damage can lead to the accumulation of fluid in the macula, which can cause blurred vision.

Anti-VEGF drugs are a class of medications that are used to treat macular edema. These drugs work by blocking the action of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a protein that is involved in the formation of new blood vessels. By blocking VEGF, anti-VEGF drugs can help to reduce the amount of fluid in the macula and improve vision.

Fluorescein angiography is a test that is used to visualize the blood vessels in the eye. This test is not necessary to diagnose macular edema, and it is not the first-line treatment for this condition. OCT of the optic nerve head is a test that is used to evaluate the health of the optic nerve. This test is not necessary to diagnose macular edema, and it is not the first-line treatment for this condition. OCT-angiography of the macula is a test that is used to visualize the blood vessels in the macula. This test is not necessary to diagnose macular edema, and it is not the first-line treatment for this condition.

Therefore, the best course of treatment for the patient in this case is to administer intravitreal anti-VEGF. This will help to reduce the amount of fluid in the macula and improve vision.

The patient has a history of intravenous drug abuse and multiple sexual partners, which are risk factors for HIV and syphilis. These conditions can cause bilateral hemorrhagic optic disc edema, as seen in this patient. Obtaining HIV and syphilis serology results will help to determine the cause of the patient's vision loss and guide treatment.

Option B, administering 1000 mg of intravenous methylprednisolone, is a treatment for optic neuritis, which is a common cause of unilateral optic disc edema. However, the patient in this case has bilateral optic disc edema, which is more likely to be caused by a systemic condition such as HIV or syphilis. Therefore, intravenous methylprednisolone would not be the most appropriate treatment at this time.

Option C, injecting intravitreal foscarnet, is a treatment for cytomegalovirus retinitis, which is a common cause of retinal infection in patients with HIV. However, the patient in this case does not have any signs of retinal infection, such as retinal hemorrhages or exudates. Therefore, intravitreal foscarnet would not be the most appropriate treatment at this time.

Option D, obtaining computed tomographic scan of the brain, is a test that can be used to rule out other causes of vision loss, such as a stroke or tumor. However, the patient in this case has no other signs or symptoms that suggest a neurological disorder. Therefore, obtaining a computed tomographic scan of the brain is not necessary at this time.

The patient has a history of trabeculectomy and 5-fluorouracil injection, which are both risk factors for infectious endophthalmitis. He also has vitreitis, which is a common finding in infectious endophthalmitis. In addition, his vitreous samples were negative for growth, which is consistent with an infection. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is infectious endophthalmitis.

The treatment for infectious endophthalmitis is a combination of antibiotics and steroids. The antibiotics are used to kill the bacteria, while the steroids are used to reduce inflammation. Topical steroids are often used in the initial treatment of infectious endophthalmitis, as they can be started immediately and are effective in reducing inflammation. Systemic steroids are also often used, as they can better penetrate the blood-ocular barrier and reach the site of infection.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option B: Switch to intravenous meropenem is incorrect because there is no evidence that meropenem is superior to vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam for the treatment of infectious endophthalmitis.
* Option C: Repeat aqueous or vitreous sampling is incorrect because the vitreous samples were already negative for growth. Repeat sampling is not likely to yield any additional information.
* Option D: Observe while receiving current therapy is incorrect because the patient's vision is continuing to decline. The patient needs to be treated more aggressively to prevent further vision loss.

Explanation:

A branchial cleft cyst is a developmental anomaly that occurs when one of the branchial arches fails to close completely during embryonic development. This results in a fluid-filled cyst that can develop anywhere along the line of the branchial arches, from the neck to the upper chest. Branchial cleft cysts are typically diagnosed in children or young adults, and they are more common in females than in males. The most common symptom of a branchial cleft cyst is a painless mass in the neck that may or may not be tender. The mass may increase in size over time, and it may become infected. Treatment for a branchial cleft cyst is surgical removal.

Atypical mycobacterium infection is an infection caused by a type of bacteria called atypical mycobacteria. Atypical mycobacteria can cause a variety of infections, including skin infections, lung infections, and lymph node infections. The most common symptom of atypical mycobacterium infection is a persistent cough. Other symptoms may include fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Treatment for atypical mycobacterium infection is with antibiotics.

Chronic sialadenitis is a long-term inflammation of the salivary glands. The most common cause of chronic sialadenitis is bacterial infection. Other causes of chronic sialadenitis include obstruction of the salivary ducts, autoimmune disorders, and tumors. The most common symptom of chronic sialadenitis is pain and swelling in the salivary glands. Other symptoms may include fever, difficulty swallowing, and a bad taste in the mouth. Treatment for chronic sialadenitis is with antibiotics, anti-inflammatory medications, and/or surgery to remove the infected salivary gland.

A venolymphatic malformation is a congenital anomaly of the lymphatic system. Venolymphatic malformations are characterized by the abnormal growth of lymphatic vessels. Venolymphatic malformations can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the head and neck. The most common symptom of a venolymphatic malformation is a soft, compressible mass. Other symptoms may include pain, swelling, and infection. Treatment for venolymphatic malformations is with surgery, radiation therapy, or sclerotherapy.

In the case presented, the patient is an 8-year-old boy with a 3-year history of a fluctuating right parotid mass. The mass is tender and fluctuant, and there is no accompanying cervical lymphadenopathy. The patient has no fevers or systemic symptoms. Laboratory evaluation reveals normal complete blood cell count and erythrocyte sedimentation rate levels. Magnetic resonance imaging shows a 1.9-cm peripherally enhancing, centrally necrotic lesion overlying the superficial right parotid gland with multiple subcentimeter necrotic lymph nodes within the right parotid gland. These findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of venolymphatic malformation. Branchial cleft cysts are typically diagnosed in children or young adults, and they are more common in females than in males. The most common symptom of a branchial cleft cyst is a painless mass in the neck that may or may not be tender. The mass may increase in size over time, and it may become infected. The patient in this case does not have a history of a painless mass in the neck, and the mass is tender and fluctuant. Atypical mycobacterium infection can cause a variety of infections, including skin infections, lung infections, and lymph node infections. The most common symptom of atypical mycobacterium infection is a persistent cough. Other symptoms may include fever, night sweats, and weight loss. The patient in this case does not have a history of a persistent cough, fever, night sweats, or weight loss. Chronic sialadenitis is a long-term inflammation of the salivary glands. The most common cause of chronic sialadenitis is bacterial infection. Other causes of chronic sialadenitis include obstruction of the salivary ducts, autoimmune disorders, and tumors. The most common symptom of chronic sialadenitis is pain and swelling in the salivary glands. Other symptoms may include fever, difficulty swallowing, and a bad taste in the mouth. The patient in this case does not have a history of pain and swelling in the salivary glands, fever, difficulty swallowing, or a bad taste in the mouth.

Intravascular papillary endothelial hyperplasia (IPEH) is a benign vascular lesion that can occur in any organ, but is most commonly found in the skin and gastrointestinal tract. It is characterized by the proliferation of endothelial cells within blood vessels, which can lead to the formation of small, tumor-like masses. IPEH is usually asymptomatic, but can sometimes cause bleeding or pain.

In the case presented, the patient has a history of melanoma and has recently undergone surgery to remove a melanoma lesion from her left arm. Three weeks after the surgery, she developed two indurated and mobile subcutaneous nodules on the anterior surface of her arm. The nodules were biopsied, and the histopathologic findings were consistent with IPEH. Immunohistochemistry showed that the endothelial cells in the nodules were positive for D2-40, a marker that is typically expressed in lymphatic vessels. These findings suggest that the nodules are likely due to IPEH, which is a common complication of lymphatic surgery.

B is incorrect because pseudo-aneurysmal metastasis of melanoma is a rare condition that is characterized by the formation of a pseudoaneurysm (a false aneurysm) in a blood vessel that has been invaded by metastatic melanoma cells. Pseudoaneurysms are typically caused by trauma or infection, but can also occur spontaneously. They are most commonly found in the extremities, but can occur in any organ. Symptoms of pseudo-aneurysmal metastasis of melanoma include pain, swelling, and bleeding. Treatment typically involves surgical resection of the pseudoaneurysm and any involved lymph nodes.

C is incorrect because axillary web syndrome is a rare condition that is characterized by the development of a web-like band of scar tissue in the axilla (the armpit). The web can cause pain, numbness, and weakness in the arm. It is most commonly caused by surgery or radiation therapy to the axilla. Treatment typically involves physical therapy and/or surgery to release the web.

D is incorrect because traumatic humeral pseudo-aneurysm is a rare condition that is characterized by the formation of a pseudoaneurysm in the humeral artery. Pseudoaneurysms are typically caused by trauma, but can also occur spontaneously. They are most commonly found in the extremities, but can occur in any organ. Symptoms of traumatic humeral pseudo-aneurysm include pain, swelling, and bleeding. Treatment typically involves surgical repair of the pseudoaneurysm.

 13%|█▎        | 201/1525 [47:01<5:47:02, 15.73s/it]The answer is: A. Ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring.

Explanation:

The patient in the case presented has a history of cardiac arrest after receiving adenosine for sustained supraventricular tachycardia and tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy. He also has a history of atrial flutter. The patient was hospitalized for initiation of sotalol, a class III antiarrhythmic drug. Sotalol is known to cause widening of the QRS complex, which is seen in Figure 1B. This widening of the QRS complex could be due to the development of a new arrhythmia, such as ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. Therefore, it is important to monitor the patient closely for any signs or symptoms of arrhythmia. Ambulatory electrocardiogram monitoring is the best way to do this. It will allow the patient to be monitored at home for 24 hours or more, without the need for hospitalization. This will allow the doctor to see if the patient develops any new arrhythmias, and to intervene if necessary.

The other options are not as appropriate in this case. Electrophysiology study and catheter ablation are invasive procedures that are not necessary in this case. The patient does not have any symptoms of arrhythmia, and there is no evidence of structural heart disease. Emergency coronary angiogram is not necessary in this case, as the patient does not have any symptoms of coronary artery disease. Exercise treadmill test is not necessary in this case, as the patient does not have any symptoms of heart disease.

Explanation:

The patient's history and physical examination are concerning for child abuse. The bilateral upper eyelid ecchymosis and edema are consistent with inflicted trauma, as are the temporal mass and subconjunctival hemorrhage. The patient's age, lack of other medical history, and normal examination findings make it unlikely that his symptoms are due to a medical condition.

In cases of suspected child abuse, it is important to contact Child Protective Services (CPS) so that they can investigate the situation and provide support to the child and family. CPS will also work to prevent further abuse from occurring.

Reassurance and treatment with cool compresses and artificial tears would be appropriate for a patient with a medical condition that is causing eyelid ecchymosis and edema. However, in this case, the patient's symptoms are more likely due to child abuse, and these interventions would not address the underlying cause of the problem.

Serologic workup for bleeding diathesis would be appropriate if the patient's history and physical examination were consistent with a bleeding disorder. However, in this case, the patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with a bleeding disorder.

Therefore, the best course of action in this case is to contact Child Protective Services.

The patient has a choroidal mass that is suspicious for malignancy. The mass is large, has irregular borders, and is associated with subretinal fluid and hemorrhage. The patient also has a white blood cell count of 12,350/μL, which is elevated. These findings are concerning for a choroidal melanoma, which is a type of cancer that can spread to other parts of the body.

A comprehensive systemic workup is necessary to rule out other possible causes of the choroidal mass, such as infection or inflammation. The workup should include blood tests, imaging studies, and a biopsy of the mass.

If the workup confirms that the mass is a choroidal melanoma, the patient will need to be treated with systemic therapy. Treatment options include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy.

Enucleation (removal of the eye) is not usually recommended for choroidal melanomas unless the tumor is very large or there is evidence of metastasis.

Treatment with oral corticosteroids is not indicated for choroidal melanoma. Corticosteroids can suppress the immune system, which could allow the tumor to grow more rapidly.

Plaque radiotherapy is a type of radiation therapy that is used to treat choroidal melanomas. It is not the best option for this patient because the tumor is large and has irregular borders. Plaque radiotherapy is more effective for smaller tumors with well-defined borders.

The patient has a history of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, impaired glucose tolerance, hypothyroidism, and elevated levels of lactic acid and pyruvate acid. These findings are consistent with mitochondrial disease. Mitochondrial disease is a group of disorders caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA. Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, and they produce energy that the cell needs to function. When mitochondria are damaged, cells can't produce enough energy, and this can lead to a variety of problems, including muscle weakness, cognitive impairment, and hearing loss.

Sequencing of mitochondrial DNA is the most accurate way to diagnose mitochondrial disease. This test can identify mutations in mitochondrial DNA that are responsible for the disease. Once the mutation is identified, it can be used to provide genetic counseling to the patient and their family.

Sequencing of myosin heavy chain gene, dystropin gene, and titin gene are not the correct answers because these genes are not associated with mitochondrial disease.

Explanation:

CRMO is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology that affects the bone and soft tissues. It is characterized by recurrent episodes of inflammation that can lead to bone destruction and deformity. The disease most commonly affects children and young adults, and it is more common in females.

The diagnosis of CRMO is based on a combination of clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The classic clinical presentation of CRMO is a triad of fever, bone pain, and soft tissue swelling. Laboratory tests may reveal an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP). Imaging studies, such as X-rays, computed tomography (CT) scans, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, can show evidence of bone destruction and inflammation.

There is no cure for CRMO, but the disease can be managed with a combination of medications, surgery, and physical therapy. Medications used to treat CRMO include corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and immune modulators. Surgery may be necessary to remove diseased bone or to correct deformities. Physical therapy can help to improve range of motion and function.

The prognosis for patients with CRMO varies depending on the severity of the disease. With proper treatment, most patients can expect to live normal, active lives. However, some patients may experience long-term complications of the disease, such as bone deformity and chronic pain.

The other possible answers are incorrect because they do not describe the patient's symptoms or findings.

Actinomycosis is a chronic infection caused by Actinomyces bacteria. It can affect any part of the body, but it is most common in the head and neck, lungs, and abdomen. The classic presentation of actinomycosis is a draining sinus tract with a sulfur granule.

Atypical vasculitis is a group of autoimmune diseases that affect the blood vessels. The symptoms of atypical vasculitis vary depending on the type of vasculitis, but they may include fever, rash, joint pain, and organ damage.

Synovitis, acne, pustulosis, hyperostosis, and osteitis syndrome (SAPHO) is a rare autoimmune disease that affects the skin, joints, bones, and eyes. The symptoms of SAPHO typically begin in adolescence or early adulthood, and they may include recurrent skin infections, joint pain, and bone pain.

Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is a chronic inflammatory disease of unknown etiology that affects the bone and soft tissues. It is characterized by recurrent episodes of inflammation that can lead to bone destruction and deformity. The disease most commonly affects children and young adults, and it is more common in females.

The patient has a near-total retinal detachment with no identifiable retinal break. This indicates that the retina is detached from the underlying choroid due to a tear or hole in the retina. The only way to repair a retinal detachment is to remove the vitreous gel from the eye and then reattach the retina to the choroid. This is done through a procedure called a pars plana vitrectomy.

Intravitreal vancomycin and ceftazidime are antibiotics that are used to treat bacterial infections of the eye. However, there is no evidence that the patient has a bacterial infection of the eye. In fact, the patient's infectious workup was negative. Therefore, there is no need to inject intravitreal vancomycin and ceftazidime.

Oral prednisone is a corticosteroid that is used to treat inflammation. However, there is no evidence that the patient has inflammation of the eye. In fact, the patient's eye examination was normal, except for the retinal detachment. Therefore, there is no need to start oral prednisone.

Therefore, the only treatment that will likely be effective in repairing the patient's retinal detachment is a pars plana vitrectomy.

 14%|█▎        | 207/1525 [48:18<4:58:30, 13.59s/it]The correct answer is: D. Obtain thoracic lymph node biopsy.

The patient in the case presented with bilateral panuveitis and myeloradiculopathy. She was initially treated with RIPE therapy for presumed tuberculosis, but her symptoms recurred after treatment was completed. Further testing revealed lymphadenopathy, an enlarged spleen, and abnormal spinal cord imaging. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis, a multisystem autoimmune disease that can affect the lungs, eyes, skin, heart, kidneys, and central nervous system.

The gold standard for diagnosing neurosarcoidosis is a biopsy of affected tissue, such as a lymph node or a piece of skin. In this case, the patient's thoracic lymph nodes are enlarged and abnormal on imaging, making them an ideal site for biopsy. A biopsy would provide definitive diagnosis and help to guide treatment.

The other options are not as appropriate in this case. Plasmapheresis is a treatment that removes harmful proteins from the blood. It is not a first-line treatment for neurosarcoidosis, and it is not likely to be helpful in this patient. A lacrimal gland biopsy is not necessary to diagnose neurosarcoidosis, and it is not likely to be helpful in this patient. Re-initiating RIPE therapy is not appropriate in this case, as the patient has already been treated with this regimen and her symptoms have recurred.

Therefore, the best next step in the management of this patient is to obtain a thoracic lymph node biopsy.

Explanation:

The patient in this case has a history of recurrent pustular eruptions on her face that are exacerbated by sunlight. She has tried various treatments without success, and her lesions resolve spontaneously in 3 to 4 days. The physical examination findings are consistent with actinic folliculitis, a photosensitive dermatosis characterized by small, follicular pustules on sun-exposed skin. The biopsy findings of intrafollicular and subcorneal pustule formation are also consistent with this diagnosis.

Papulopustular rosacea is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease that affects the central face. It is characterized by the presence of papules, pustules, and telangiectasias. Rosacea is not photosensitive, and it does not typically resolve spontaneously.

Pinpoint papular light eruption is a transient, photosensitive eruption that occurs in response to ultraviolet (UV) exposure. It is characterized by small, erythematous papules that resolve within a few days.

Acute localized exanthematous pustulosis (ALEP) is a rare, self-limited, photosensitive eruption that occurs in adults. It is characterized by the sudden onset of fever, malaise, and a widespread eruption of small, pustules on sun-exposed skin. ALEP typically resolves within 2 to 4 weeks.

In summary, the patient in this case has a history and physical examination findings that are consistent with actinic folliculitis. The biopsy findings are also consistent with this diagnosis. Papulopustular rosacea, pinpoint papular light eruption, and ALEP are all less likely diagnoses in this patient.

Explanation: Hair follicle nevus is a congenital anomaly of the hair follicles that presents as multiple, small, skin-colored papules or nodules. The lesions are typically distributed along Blaschko lines, which are lines of skin development that are visible in the fetus. Hair follicle nevi are usually asymptomatic, but they may occasionally be pruritic or tender. The diagnosis of hair follicle nevus is made based on the clinical presentation and a skin biopsy. Treatment is not usually necessary, but surgical removal may be considered for cosmetic reasons.

B. Sebaceous nevus is a congenital anomaly of the sebaceous glands that presents as a single, large, tan or brown macule or plaque. The lesions are typically located on the face or scalp. Sebaceous nevi are usually asymptomatic, but they may occasionally be pruritic or tender. The diagnosis of sebaceous nevus is made based on the clinical presentation and a skin biopsy. Treatment is not usually necessary, but surgical removal may be considered for cosmetic reasons.

C. Connective tissue nevus is a congenital anomaly of the connective tissue that presents as a single, large, skin-colored or pink papule or nodule. The lesions are typically located on the trunk or extremities. Connective tissue nevi are usually asymptomatic, but they may occasionally be pruritic or tender. The diagnosis of connective tissue nevus is made based on the clinical presentation and a skin biopsy. Treatment is not usually necessary, but surgical removal may be considered for cosmetic reasons.

D. Trichofolliculoma is a benign tumor of the hair follicle that presents as a single, small, skin-colored or pink papule or nodule. The lesions are typically located on the face or scalp. Trichofolliculoma are usually asymptomatic, but they may occasionally be pruritic or tender. The diagnosis of trichofolliculoma is made based on the clinical presentation and a skin biopsy. Treatment is not usually necessary, but surgical removal may be considered for cosmetic reasons.

In the case presented, the patient has multiple, small, skin-colored papules or nodules that are distributed along Blaschko lines. This is the classic presentation of hair follicle nevus. The other options are not as likely in this case. Sebaceous nevus is typically a single, large, tan or brown macule or plaque. Connective tissue nevus is typically a single, large, skin-colored or pink papule or nodule. Trichofolliculoma is typically a single, small, skin-colored or pink papule or nodule.

 14%|█▍        | 210/1525 [48:57<4:53:05, 13.37s/it]The correct answer is: C. The isolated reduced Dlco likely reflects an alveolar-capillary gas transfer abnormality.

The diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (Dlco) is a measure of how well the lungs can transfer oxygen from the air into the bloodstream. It is a useful test for diagnosing and monitoring a variety of lung diseases.

In this case, the patient's Dlco is reduced, but his forced vital capacity (FVC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) are normal. This suggests that the patient has an abnormality in the alveolar-capillary membrane, which is the barrier between the air sacs (alveoli) and the capillaries. This type of abnormality can be caused by a variety of diseases, including pulmonary fibrosis, sarcoidosis, and interstitial lung disease.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: The hemoglobin level is not likely to explain the reduced Dlco. The hemoglobin level is a measure of the amount of oxygen-carrying protein in the blood. It is not a direct measure of the ability of the lungs to transfer oxygen from the air into the bloodstream.
* Option B: The isolated reduced Dlco is important, even though the FVC and FEV1 are normal. The Dlco is a sensitive test for detecting early lung disease. Even though the patient's FVC and FEV1 are normal, his Dlco is reduced, which suggests that he may have early lung disease.
* Option D: The isolated reduced Dlco is not likely to reflect early small airway disease. Small airway disease is a condition that affects the small airways in the lungs. It can cause symptoms such as wheezing, shortness of breath, and chest tightness. However, small airway disease does not usually cause a reduction in the Dlco.

Explanation:

The patient is a previously healthy 25-year-old woman who presented with headache, dysarthria, double vision, and dizziness for 1 week. She denied any history of fever, head trauma, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, or cough. She had traveled to northeastern Brazil 2 months before the onset of the neurological symptoms.

On examination, she had a mild right-side hemiparesis with hyperreflexia and hemiataxia. She could walk unassisted but presented with a broad base. There were no meningeal signs. She did not present with hepatosplenomegaly of lymphadenopathy. Her cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyperintense lesion with heterogeneous gadolinium enhancement in the pons. There were no signs of diffusion restriction on diffusion-weighted imaging or hemorrhages on susceptibility-weighted imaging.

The laboratory test results showed a hemoglobin level of 15.3 g/dL (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10.0), total leukocyte count of 10 390/uL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001), of which 1703 (16.4%) were eosinophils, and a platelet count of 284 000/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001). The patient’s liver and kidney function test results were normal. Computed tomography of the chest revealed bilateral patchy pulmonary infiltrates.

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis showed 640 cells, of which 57% were lymphocytes, 26% were eosinophils, and 13% were monocytes; protein levels were 70 mg/dL, and glucose levels were 46 mg/dL. Her blood cultures were found to be sterile.

The most likely diagnosis is eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), also known as Churg-Strauss syndrome. EGPA is a rare, chronic, multisystem vasculitis characterized by the infiltration of eosinophils into the walls of small and medium-sized blood vessels. It can affect any organ system, but the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and kidneys are most commonly involved.

The diagnosis of EGPA is based on the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging studies. The characteristic laboratory findings include an elevated eosinophil count in the blood and CSF, as well as a raised serum IgE level. Imaging studies may show evidence of inflammation in the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, or kidneys.

The treatment of EGPA is with corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents. In some cases, plasmapheresis may be necessary. The prognosis for EGPA is variable, but with treatment, most patients have a good outcome.

The other possible diagnoses are not as likely in this case. Listeriosis is a bacterial infection that can cause meningitis, but it is usually seen in immunocompromised patients. Neuroschistosomiasis is a parasitic infection that can cause meningitis, but it is usually seen in patients who have traveled to areas where the parasite is endemic. Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is an autoimmune disorder that can cause optic neuritis and transverse myelitis, but it is not usually associated with eosinophilia.

Explanation:

Axillary lymph node biopsy is the gold standard for staging breast cancer. It is performed to determine if the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, which is an important factor in determining the stage of the cancer and the appropriate treatment.

In this case, the patient has a palpable 2.5-cm right breast mass at the 3-o’clock position without palpable axillary lymphadenopathy. Axial T2-weighted MRI at the level of the axilla revealed edema surrounding 2 enlarged, morphologically abnormal right level-1 axillary lymph nodes. These findings are highly suggestive of metastatic breast cancer.

Given the high suspicion of metastatic disease, it is not necessary to perform a repeat breast MRI or right axillary ultrasound 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination. These tests would not provide any additional information that would change the management of the patient.

The best course of action is to perform an axillary sentinel lymph node biopsy at the time of lumpectomy. This will provide information about the extent of the disease and help to guide further treatment.

Explanation:
The patient has a history of tertiary hyperparathyroidism, which is a condition in which the parathyroid glands produce too much parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH is a hormone that helps to regulate blood calcium levels. In people with tertiary hyperparathyroidism, the high levels of PTH can lead to a number of problems, including bone pain, kidney stones, and osteoporosis.

In this case, the patient's elevated alkaline phosphatase level and high PTH level are consistent with a diagnosis of tertiary hyperparathyroidism. The patient's symptoms of polyarthralgia and swelling of her fingers and toes are also consistent with this diagnosis.

The treatment for tertiary hyperparathyroidism is parathyroidectomy, which is the surgical removal of one or more parathyroid glands. This surgery is usually very effective in relieving the symptoms of tertiary hyperparathyroidism.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. A positron emission computed tomography (PET) scan is a type of imaging test that can be used to detect cancer. However, there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has cancer. A bone biopsy is a procedure in which a small piece of bone is removed and examined under a microscope. This procedure can be used to diagnose a number of bone diseases, but it is not necessary in this case.

The patient has subacute-onset blurry vision in both eyes, which is a concerning symptom. The patient also has a history of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), which is a type of cancer that can affect the blood and bone marrow. CML can cause a variety of eye problems, including blurry vision.

In order to determine the cause of the patient's blurry vision, it is important to rule out any underlying medical conditions. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits is a non-invasive test that can be used to assess the health of the brain and eyes. An MRI can help to identify any tumors, blood clots, or other abnormalities that may be causing the patient's blurry vision.

Bilateral intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections are a treatment option for certain types of eye problems, such as macular degeneration. However, these injections are not appropriate for the patient in this case because the cause of his blurry vision is not known. It is important to rule out any underlying medical conditions before starting any treatment.

A rapid referral to radiation oncology for bilateral optic nerve radiation is a treatment option for certain types of cancer, such as optic nerve glioma. However, this treatment is not appropriate for the patient in this case because he does not have cancer. It is important to rule out any underlying medical conditions before starting any treatment.

Observation and reassurance are not appropriate for the patient in this case because he has a concerning symptom. The patient's blurry vision could be caused by a serious medical condition, such as a tumor or blood clot. It is important to rule out any underlying medical conditions before starting any treatment.

Explanation:
The patient has a right homonymous hemianopia, which is a loss of vision in the right half of both visual fields. This is most commonly caused by a stroke in the left occipital lobe, which is responsible for processing visual information from the right side of the visual field. The patient also has a history of dyslipidemia, which is a risk factor for stroke.

The patient's initial noncontrast CT scan of the head was normal, but his MRI of the brain revealed subtle abnormal T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensity involving the left occipital cortex. This is consistent with a small stroke.

To further evaluate the patient, a lumbar puncture should be performed to assess the cerebrospinal fluid contents. This will help to determine the cause of the stroke, such as a blood clot or a hemorrhage.

Measure C-reactive protein level and erythrocyte sedimentation rate are not necessary in this case, as they are not specific for stroke. Measure blood glucose levels is also not necessary, as the patient's history and physical examination do not suggest diabetes. Perform magnetic resonance angiography of the head is not necessary, as the MRI of the brain already showed the abnormal T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensity involving the left occipital cortex.

Excisional biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing periorbital masses. It is the only way to definitively determine whether a lesion is benign or malignant. In this case, the patient has a 3-mm subcutaneous, firm, mobile, noncompressible lesion near the lateral canthus of the right eye without overlying erythema, warmth, telangiectasia, or ulceration. These clinical features are concerning for a possible malignancy. Therefore, the best course of action is to perform an excisional biopsy to rule out malignancy.

A trial of conservative management with warm compresses and eyelid massage is not appropriate in this case because the patient has a suspicious lesion that needs to be evaluated for malignancy. Incision and drainage is not appropriate in this case because it is not a surgical procedure that is indicated for the diagnosis or treatment of periorbital masses.

Explanation:

The patient has a presumptive diagnosis of optic nerve glioma, which is a rare, slow-growing tumor of the optic nerve. The most common treatment for optic nerve glioma is surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible. However, in this case, the tumor has already progressed to the point where it is causing no light perception vision in the right eye. In this situation, surgery is unlikely to improve the patient's vision and may actually worsen her condition. Therefore, the best option is to start chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. These treatments can help to shrink the tumor and slow its growth. They may also help to improve the patient's vision.

The other options are not appropriate in this situation. A transorbital biopsy would not be helpful because it would not remove the tumor and would likely cause further damage to the optic nerve. Observation is also not an appropriate option because the tumor is already causing significant vision loss.

 14%|█▍        | 219/1525 [50:47<4:26:35, 12.25s/it]The correct answer is C: Linear or annular lupus erythematosus panniculitis of the scalp.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of linear or annular lupus erythematosus panniculitis of the scalp. The patient is a man in his 50s who presents with an asymptomatic, arc-shaped, depressed skin groove on the left side of his forehead, frontal scalp, and vertex area. Localized linear hair loss and hair thinning on the left scalp area were observed. The patient reported that when the lesion had begun to appear, approximately 10 years earlier, he had received 2 doses of intralesional steroid via injection on a small bald patch on the vertex. Thereafter, the lesion gradually progressed to the frontal scalp and eventually made a linear furrow on the left side of his forehead.

Physical examination revealed 2 long, curved-line, depressed, alopecic patches on the left side of the vertex and frontal scalp area extending to the left eyebrow. The lesions measured (length × width) 7 × 2 cm and 6 × 1 cm, respectively. Dermoscopic examination of the alopecic area revealed several short vellus hairs, yellow dots, and honeycomb hyperpigmentation; however, broken hairs were not seen. The result of a hair pull test was negative. The patient denied any trauma history and had no history of connective tissue disease nor any evidence of systemic involvement, such as arthralgia, photosensitivity, or skin rashes. Skin biopsies were performed on the left side of the vertex and the forehead. Histopathologic findings of the 2 biopsy specimens were identical, showing predominant lymphocytic infiltrates in perifollicular and periappendageal regions of the dermis and lobular panniculitis.

Linear or annular lupus erythematosus panniculitis of the scalp is a rare form of lupus erythematosus that typically presents as a single or multiple, linear or annular, depressed, alopecic lesions on the scalp. The lesions are often associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, but they can also occur in isolation. The exact cause of linear or annular lupus erythematosus panniculitis of the scalp is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder. The diagnosis is made based on clinical presentation, histopathologic findings, and serologic testing. Treatment typically involves the use of topical or systemic corticosteroids, as well as immunosuppressive agents.

The other possible diagnoses are not as likely in this case. Linear atrophoderma of Moulin is a rare, idiopathic disorder that typically presents as a single, linear, depressed, atrophic lesion on the trunk or extremities. The lesions are often associated with Raynaud's phenomenon and livedo reticularis. Linear discoid lupus erythematosus is a chronic, autoimmune disorder that typically presents as a single or multiple, discoid, erythematous, scaly lesions on the face, scalp, and ears. The lesions are often associated with systemic lupus erythematosus. Localized lipodystrophy is a rare disorder that typically presents as a single or multiple, localized areas of fat loss. The lesions can occur anywhere on the body, but they are most common on the face, trunk, and extremities.

 14%|█▍        | 220/1525 [51:04<4:55:57, 13.61s/it]The correct answer is: B. Thymoma-associated multiorgan autoimmunity.

The patient presented with a mediastinal mass, hypogammaglobulinemia, and oral lichenoid lesions. The mediastinal mass was a type AB thymoma, which is a type of thymoma that is associated with autoimmune diseases. The hypogammaglobulinemia is a condition in which the body does not produce enough antibodies, which can make people more susceptible to infections. The oral lichenoid lesions are a type of skin rash that can be associated with autoimmune diseases.

All of the other answers are incorrect. Paraneoplastic autoimmune multiorgan syndrome is a rare condition that is characterized by the development of multiple autoimmune diseases in the setting of a cancer. Good syndrome is a rare condition that is characterized by the development of hypogammaglobulinemia and autoimmune diseases. Paraneoplastic lichen planus is a rare condition that is characterized by the development of lichen planus in the setting of a cancer.

In this case, the patient's symptoms are most likely due to the thymoma. The thymoma is a type of thymoma that is associated with autoimmune diseases, and the patient's hypogammaglobulinemia and oral lichenoid lesions are consistent with this diagnosis. The other possible diagnoses are less likely because they do not explain all of the patient's symptoms.

Explanation:

The patient is a young man with no significant medical history who presents with a 1-day history of intermittent palpitations and chest pain associated with shortness of breath. On presentation, he appears anxious with a heart rate of 101 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute, blood pressure of 151/79 mm Hg, and pulse oximetry of 96% in room air. His cardiopulmonary examination results, complete blood cell count, basic metabolic panel, and cardiac troponins were all within normal limits. His electrocardiogram on presentation and echocardiogram are shown in Figure 1 and the Video.

The electrocardiogram shows T wave inversions in V1 through V3, which is a non-specific finding that could be due to a number of conditions, including myocardial ischemia, pericarditis, or electrolyte imbalance. The echocardiogram shows a normal left ventricular ejection fraction and no evidence of structural heart disease.

Given the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings, the next step in management should be to obtain a cardiac MRI. Cardiac MRI is a highly sensitive and specific test for the evaluation of coronary artery disease, as well as other structural heart diseases. In this case, cardiac MRI would be the most appropriate test to evaluate the patient's chest pain and palpitations.

Catheterization on the left side of the heart and coronary angiogram is an invasive procedure that is typically reserved for patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease. Dobutamine stress echocardiogram is a non-invasive test that can be used to evaluate the function of the left ventricle and to assess for ischemia. Computed tomographic angiography of chest is a non-invasive test that can be used to evaluate the coronary arteries. However, neither of these tests would be the most appropriate test in this case.

Explanation: The patient presented with acute-onset weakness of his bilateral lower limbs for 3 days, accompanied by ascending numbness to just below his nipples. Three weeks prior, he had developed acute urinary retention. Neurological examination revealed weakness in bilateral lower limbs (Medical Research Council grade 4 on the right and grade 3 on the left), extensor plantar responses, and a sensory level at T6. Magnetic resonance imaging of his thoracic spine was performed 10 days after the onset of weakness and did not show any signal abnormalities or restricted diffusion. Cerebrospinal fluid analysis findings were remarkable for elevated protein (0.14 g/dL) but white cell count (5 cells/mm3) and glucose levels (54.05 mg/dL) were normal. Cytology and flow cytometry were negative for malignancy. Antibodies to aquaporin 4 and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein were not detected. The patient developed a sudden worsening of weakness in his legs 2 weeks after initial presentation. Repeated thoracic spine imaging showed an area of T2 hyperintensity in the left posterolateral cord at T7, which did not enhance with contrast or show restricted diffusion. Notably, he had a 4-year history of an asymptomatic papular skin eruption with more lesions developing in the last 4 months. These were distributed on the neck, trunk, and limbs, sparing his face, scalp, and genitalia. Findings of extensive workup for malignancy, including full-body computed tomography scan, paraneoplastic antibody panel, and systemic autoimmune diseases (antinuclear antibody, antidouble stranded DNA, and myositis antibody panel), were negative. The skin papules were biopsied.

The clinical presentation and imaging findings are most consistent with malignant atrophic papulosis (MAP). MAP is a rare, chronic, progressive, and fatal cutaneous disease characterized by the development of atrophic papules on the skin. The papules are typically small, round, and well-demarcated, with a central umbilication. They may be hypopigmented or hyperpigmented, and they may be associated with pruritus. MAP is most commonly seen in middle-aged and elderly adults, and it is more common in men than in women. The etiology of MAP is unknown, but it is thought to be a disorder of the immune system. There is no cure for MAP, and treatment is aimed at controlling the symptoms and preventing complications. The most common treatment is topical corticosteroids, but other treatments, such as systemic corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and phototherapy, may also be used.

The other options are not as likely diagnoses in this case. Disseminated discoid lupus is a chronic, autoimmune disease that primarily affects the skin. The lesions of disseminated discoid lupus are typically red, scaly, and raised. They may be associated with scarring, and they may be painful. Scleromyxoedema is a rare, chronic, progressive, and disabling disease characterized by the deposition of mucinous material in the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and other organs. The skin lesions of scleromyxoedema are typically firm, waxy, and nonpitting. They may be associated with Raynaud's phenomenon, and they may be disabling. Secondary syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. The skin lesions of secondary syphilis are typically widespread, and they may be papular, pustular, or nodular. They may be associated with fever, lymphadenopathy, and malaise.

 15%|█▍        | 223/1525 [51:45<5:00:39, 13.86s/it]The correct answer is: D. Order a urine nucleic acid amplification test for Chlamydia trachomatis.

Explanation:

The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of Chlamydia trachomatis infection. The most common symptoms of chlamydia infection are urethritis, cervicitis, and proctitis. However, the patient may also present with arthralgias, eye pain, and a purpuric rash. The diagnosis of chlamydia infection is confirmed by a positive nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) of a urine sample.

A urine NAAT is the most sensitive and specific test for chlamydia infection. It is more sensitive than culture and less likely to be affected by antibiotic treatment. A urine NAAT is also less invasive than a cervical swab, which is the preferred test for chlamydia infection in women.

The other options are not appropriate in this case.

A: Checking antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) titers is not indicated in this case. ANCA is an antibody that is found in the blood of people with autoimmune diseases, such as Wegener's granulomatosis and Churg-Strauss syndrome. These diseases are characterized by inflammation of the blood vessels, which can lead to kidney disease, lung disease, and heart disease. The patient does not have any symptoms of these diseases, so there is no reason to check her ANCA titers.

B: Checking chikungunya serology is not indicated in this case. Chikungunya is a viral infection that is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. The most common symptoms of chikungunya are fever, joint pain, and a rash. The patient does not have any symptoms of chikungunya, so there is no reason to check her chikungunya serology.

C: Obtaining a transthoracic echocardiogram is not indicated in this case. A transthoracic echocardiogram is a test that uses sound waves to create a moving image of the heart. It is used to diagnose heart problems, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and valvular disease. The patient does not have any symptoms of heart disease, so there is no reason to obtain a transthoracic echocardiogram.

 15%|█▍        | 224/1525 [52:01<5:15:39, 14.56s/it]Answer: C. Recheck a rapid heterophile antibody test.

Explanation:

The patient is a 18-year-old woman with no significant medical history and no history of sexual intercourse who presented for evaluation of pharyngitis and tonsillar exudates of 1 week duration. She reported neck swelling and an occasional dry cough but no fevers, chills, trismus, headache, dyspnea, chest pain, abdominal pain, fatigue, or rash. One week prior to presentation, she visited an urgent care clinic for evaluation of pharyngitis and white exudates on her tonsils. Results of a rapid strep test and heterophile antibody test (monospot) were negative. A throat culture was obtained and she was prescribed amoxicillin (500 mg twice daily for 10 days) for possible group A streptococcal infection. Despite taking antibiotics for 7 days, she had no improvement in her symptoms. One day prior to presentation, the urgent care clinic notified the patient that her throat culture results were negative.

On presentation, the patient was in no acute distress and had normal vital signs. She had bilateral white tonsillar exudates and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy, but no exudate was observed elsewhere in the oral cavity and the uvula was midline (Figure). There was no axillary or inguinal adenopathy and no hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. The remainder of the physical examination was normal.

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is infectious mononucleosis, a viral infection caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Infectious mononucleosis is characterized by fever, pharyngitis, lymphadenopathy, and a characteristic rash (the "mono rash"). The diagnosis is usually made clinically, but can be confirmed by serologic testing for EBV antibodies.

The treatment for infectious mononucleosis is supportive. Patients should be encouraged to rest and drink plenty of fluids. Over-the-counter pain relievers such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen can be used to relieve fever and pain. Antibiotics are not effective against EBV, and should not be used in the treatment of infectious mononucleosis.

In this patient, the most appropriate next step is to recheck a rapid heterophile antibody test. A positive heterophile antibody test is highly suggestive of infectious mononucleosis. If the heterophile antibody test is negative, other tests such as a monospot test or EBV serology may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

The other options are not appropriate in this patient. Obtaining an ultrasound of the neck would not be helpful in the diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis. Azithromycin is an antibiotic that is not effective against EBV. Treating with an oral antifungal medication would be inappropriate, as this patient does not have a fungal infection.

 15%|█▍        | 225/1525 [52:18<5:28:46, 15.17s/it]The correct answer is C: Order magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits.

The patient in the case is a 14-year-old boy with a 5-day history of ocular and periocular pain with photophobia in his right eye. He has a history of atopic dermatitis, but his medical history is otherwise unremarkable. On examination, he has conjunctival hyperemia and ciliary congestion, anterior chamber flare 2+, and a few nongranulomatous keratic precipitates in the right eye. The left anterior segment is quiet. Intraocular pressure is 15 mm Hg OU. Pupillary light responses are normal. Dilated fundus examination reveals 1+ of vitritis (binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy score) in the right eye and swelling of the optic disc in both eyes, to a greater extent in the right eye. Routine blood tests, including full blood cell count, plasma glucose levels, liver function test, and kidney function test, were performed on the same day and showed a serum creatinine level of 1.57 mg/dL (reference range: 0.5-1.0 mg/dL; to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4). Antibodies anti–Treponema pallidum were tested and the results were negative.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes anterior uveitis, optic neuritis, and posterior uveitis. Anterior uveitis is the most likely diagnosis, given the patient's history, examination findings, and laboratory results. Optic neuritis is less likely, given the lack of visual loss or other neurological symptoms. Posterior uveitis is also less likely, given the absence of posterior segment findings on examination.

The initial management of anterior uveitis includes treatment with topical corticosteroids and cycloplegics. However, in this patient, the presence of optic disc swelling and a mild elevation in serum creatinine level suggest that there may be an underlying systemic disease. Therefore, further investigations, such as magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits, are warranted to rule out an underlying cause of the uveitis.

A: Start treatment with topical corticosteroids and cycloplegics without further investigations is incorrect because this would not address the underlying cause of the uveitis.

B: Order urinalysis and urinary β2-microglobulin test is incorrect because these tests are not specific for the underlying cause of the uveitis.

D: Observe is incorrect because the patient has a mild elevation in serum creatinine level, which suggests that there may be an underlying systemic disease.

 15%|█▍        | 226/1525 [52:34<5:32:33, 15.36s/it]The correct answer is: C. Obtain magnetic resonance imaging of the brain with contrast.

The patient presents with sudden-onset bilateral horizontal diplopia accompanied by left-sided upper eyelid ptosis. She also reports a 1-week history of drooling when eating. These symptoms are concerning for a third cranial nerve palsy, which is most commonly caused by a stroke. Other possible causes include a tumor, infection, or trauma.

To further evaluate the patient, it is important to obtain a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with contrast. This test will allow us to visualize the brain and look for any signs of a stroke, tumor, or infection. An MRI is also more sensitive than a computed tomography (CT) scan for detecting small lesions.

Lumbar puncture is not necessary in this case because the patient does not have any signs of meningitis, such as fever, headache, or nuchal rigidity. In addition, lumbar puncture carries a small risk of complications, such as meningitis or bleeding.

Tests of inflammatory markers, such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP), may be useful in diagnosing an infection or inflammatory condition. However, these tests are not specific for a third cranial nerve palsy and would not be helpful in this case.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is to obtain an MRI of the brain with contrast.

The patient's history of unprotected sexual contact with multiple male partners in the past few years increases his risk for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. These STDs can cause conjunctivitis, which is inflammation of the conjunctiva, the clear membrane that covers the white of the eye and the inner surface of the eyelids. Conjunctivitis can also be caused by viruses, such as adenovirus, herpes simplex virus, and Epstein-Barr virus. In addition, the patient's history of well-controlled HIV with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) increases his risk for opportunistic infections, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis. CMV retinitis is a serious infection of the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. It can cause vision loss if it is not treated.

Because the patient has a history of both STDs and HIV, it is important to rule out these and other possible causes of his eye redness and pain. A laboratory work-up, including a complete blood count (CBC), a comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), and a viral load test, can help to identify any underlying medical conditions. In addition, a slit lamp examination, which is a specialized eye exam that allows the doctor to view the inside of the eye, can help to diagnose the specific cause of the patient's eye inflammation.

Oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and oral corticosteroids can be used to treat the symptoms of conjunctivitis, but they will not address the underlying cause of the infection. Topical corticosteroids can be used to treat the symptoms of conjunctivitis, but they can also increase the risk of developing glaucoma, a serious eye condition that can damage the optic nerve and lead to vision loss. Therefore, it is important to start with a laboratory work-up to rule out any underlying medical conditions before starting any treatment.

 15%|█▍        | 228/1525 [52:59<4:59:49, 13.87s/it]The correct answer is: **C. Biopsy.**

The patient's history of indiscriminate trauma to her left eye, primary open-angle glaucoma in both eyes treated with dorzolamide hydrochloride and brimonidine tartrate, and pseudophakia in both eyes, as well as the sudden enlargement of a cystic iris stromal lesion from the 2- to 7-o'clock position, are all concerning for a possible malignancy. A biopsy is the only way to definitively diagnose a malignancy and determine the best course of treatment.

A YAG laser to perforate the cystic wall would not be appropriate in this case, as it would not address the underlying cause of the lesion. Observation is also not an appropriate option, as the lesion could be malignant and could progress rapidly. Glaucoma tube surgery would not be appropriate in this case, as the patient's glaucoma is well-controlled with medication.

Therefore, the best course of action is to perform a biopsy of the lesion. This will allow the doctor to determine the cause of the lesion and to recommend the best course of treatment.

Explanation:
The patient has a history of pulmonary Mycobacterium avium infection secondary to hypogammaglobulinemia. She is currently being treated with clarithromycin, ethambutol, and rifabutin. These medications are all known to cause uveitis, which can present with conjunctival hyperemia, cellular reaction, and a small hypopyon. In this case, the patient's uveitis is most likely secondary to her systemic medications. Therefore, the first step in treatment is to review and adjust her systemic medications. If her uveitis does not improve with a change in medications, then topical corticosteroids can be added to the treatment regimen.

A pars plana vitrectomy is not indicated in this case because the patient's uveitis is not secondary to an infectious endophthalmitis. Treatment with topical and oral antibiotics is also not indicated because the patient's uveitis is not secondary to an infection.

 15%|█▌        | 230/1525 [53:19<4:19:37, 12.03s/it]The answer is: B. Calciphylaxis.

Calciphylaxis is a rare, life-threatening disorder characterized by calcification of small blood vessels in the skin and subcutaneous tissue. It is most commonly seen in patients with chronic kidney disease, but can also occur in patients with other conditions, such as hyperparathyroidism, malignancy, and certain medications (e.g., FGFR inhibitors).

The clinical presentation of calciphylaxis is typically characterized by painful, purple lesions on the lower extremities. These lesions can rapidly progress to necrosis and ulceration. The diagnosis of calciphylaxis is made based on clinical findings and histopathologic examination of a skin biopsy.

There is no cure for calciphylaxis, but treatment is aimed at reducing the risk of further calcification and preventing complications. Treatment options include medications to lower calcium levels, anticoagulation, and dialysis.

In this case, the patient is a 65-year-old woman with locally advanced, unresectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma being treated with pemigatinib, a FGFR inhibitor. She presented with a painful eruption on the bilateral lower extremities. Pemigatinib treatment was initiated 2 months prior to the skin findings. Laboratory evaluation demonstrated a mildly elevated D-dimer level at 578 ng/mL fibrinogen-equivalent units, prolonged prothrombin time of 12.7 seconds, elevated phosphorus level at 6.8 mg/dL (of note, phosphorus was 3.1 mg/dL 1 month prior), and normal calcium level and kidney function. Other laboratory tests to note include cryoglobulin and cryofibrinogen, which both had negative results. Within weeks, there was rapid progression with skin necrosis despite treatment initiation with rivaroxaban. Physical examination revealed retiform purpura with areas of necrosis involving the bilateral lower extremities. A punch biopsy specimen from the right calf was obtained for histopathologic analysis.

The histopathologic findings of calciphylaxis are characteristic and include calcification of small blood vessels in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. In addition, there may be evidence of pseudoxanthoma elasticum–like changes, which are characterized by fragmented calcified elastic fibers.

The clinical presentation and histopathologic findings in this case are consistent with calciphylaxis. The patient's history of cholangiocarcinoma and treatment with pemigatinib are also risk factors for calciphylaxis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is calciphylaxis.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation and histopathologic findings. Type I cryoglobulinemia is a disorder characterized by the presence of cryoglobulins, which are immunoglobulins that precipitate in the cold. Cholesterol emboli are caused by the release of cholesterol-laden debris from atherosclerotic plaques.

Explanation:

The patient in the case presented with large, purple plaques on the left lower extremity. The plaques had been present for years, but the patient noted enlargement and darkening for the past 5 years. The lesions were asymptomatic with no associated pruritus, bleeding, or pain. No treatments or diagnostic workup had been attempted prior to presentation. The patient was otherwise healthy and was a never-smoker with no history of hypertension, atherosclerotic disease, or HIV.

On physical examination, the patient had dark violaceous plaques, scattered subcutaneous nodules, and swelling to the mid-shin of the left lower extremity. There was mild warmth noted, but no palpable bruits. Complete metabolic panel, complete blood cell count, prothrombin, and serology were negative or within normal limits. A punch biopsy was performed and submitted for histopathologic analysis.

The histopathologic findings showed proliferation of superficial and deep vessels, with thickening of the endothelium. This finding is consistent with Kaposi sarcoma. Kaposi sarcoma is a vascular neoplasm that is most commonly seen in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. However, it can also occur in patients without HIV infection, particularly those of Mediterranean or Eastern European descent. The most common presentation of Kaposi sarcoma is as a violaceous plaque or nodule on the skin. The lesions can be single or multiple, and they can occur anywhere on the body. However, they are most commonly seen on the lower extremities, the face, and the trunk.

Kaposi sarcoma is typically a slow-growing tumor. However, it can be aggressive in some patients, particularly those with HIV infection. The treatment of Kaposi sarcoma depends on the stage of the disease and the patient's overall health. Treatment options include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy.

The other options are incorrect because they do not fit the patient's presentation. Stewart-Bluefarb syndrome is a rare disorder that is characterized by the development of multiple pigmented lesions on the skin. The lesions are typically benign and do not require treatment. Acroangiodermatitis of Mali is a rare disorder that is characterized by the development of red or purple lesions on the hands and feet. The lesions are typically associated with pain and swelling, and they can be difficult to treat. Lichen planus is a chronic skin condition that is characterized by the development of flat, red or purple lesions on the skin. The lesions are typically itchy and can be painful.

 15%|█▌        | 232/1525 [53:47<4:35:33, 12.79s/it]The correct answer is: C. Phaeohyphomycosis.

Explanation:

Phaeohyphomycosis is a fungal infection that can affect the skin, subcutaneous tissue, bones, and other organs. It is caused by a variety of fungi, including Fonsecaea pedrosoi, Phialophora verrucosa, and Cladosporium carrionii.

The most common presentation of phaeohyphomycosis is a single or multiple nodules on the skin. The nodules may be painless or painful, and they may be associated with inflammation and drainage. In some cases, the nodules may ulcerate.

Phaeohyphomycosis can also spread to the bones, causing osteomyelitis. Osteomyelitis is an infection of the bone marrow and surrounding bone. It is characterized by pain, swelling, and tenderness over the affected bone. In some cases, the infection may spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs, brain, or heart.

The diagnosis of phaeohyphomycosis is based on a history of exposure to the fungus, physical examination, and laboratory tests. Laboratory tests may include a skin biopsy, a blood test, and a bone biopsy.

The treatment of phaeohyphomycosis depends on the extent of the infection. In mild cases, the infection may be treated with antifungal medication. In more severe cases, the infection may require surgery to remove the infected tissue.

The prognosis for phaeohyphomycosis depends on the extent of the infection and the patient's immune status. In general, the prognosis is good for patients with mild infections who are treated promptly. However, the prognosis is poor for patients with severe infections or who have a weakened immune system.

The following are some of the reasons why C is the correct answer:

* The patient has a history of exposure to hay dust, which is a risk factor for phaeohyphomycosis.
* The patient has multiple painless nodules on his cheek, which is a common presentation of phaeohyphomycosis.
* The nodules are firm, mobile, and nontender on palpation, which are characteristic findings of phaeohyphomycosis.
* The patient has proptosis of the right eye with mild restriction of extraocular movements on lateral gaze, which can be a sign of orbital involvement in phaeohyphomycosis.
* The chest radiography imaging showed nodular opacities in right upper zone and bronchiectasis, which can be a sign of pulmonary involvement in phaeohyphomycosis.
* The histopathological examination of the skin biopsy specimen showed inflammatory infiltrate composed of giant cells in the deeper dermis extending into the subcutaneous fat, which is a characteristic finding of phaeohyphomycosis.
* The high-power view of the skin biopsy specimen showed epithelioid cell granulomas and fungal profiles within giant cells, which is a specific finding of phaeohyphomycosis.
* The periodic acid–Schiff stain highlighting septate fungal hyphae with acute-angled branching within giant cells is a definitive finding of phaeohyphomycosis.

The following are some of the reasons why A, B, and D are incorrect:

* Nontuberculous mycobacterial infection is a common cause of skin and soft tissue infections, but it is not typically associated with multiple painless nodules.
* Cutaneous aspergillosis is a rare fungal infection that can affect the skin, but it is not typically associated with multiple painless nodules.
* Entomophthoromycosis is a rare fungal infection that can affect the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and other organs, but it is not typically associated with multiple painless nodules.

The patient is a woman in her mid-60s who was in remission following successful combination chemotherapy for Burkitt lymphoma 8 years previously. She presented with dyspnea, fatigue, general malaise, and presyncope. On examination, she was normotensive, afebrile, and clinically euvolemic. Laboratory testing showed a hemoglobin level of 12.1 g/dL, white blood cell count of 9900/µL, erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 76 mm/h, lactate dehydrogenase level of 139 U/L, and normal coagulation profile. Serum immunoglobulin quantitation showed normal immunoglobulin (Ig) G, IgA, and IgM levels of 1590 mg/L, 303 mg/L, and 94 mg/L, respectively. Blood culture findings were negative.

Transthoracic and transesophageal echocardiography showed a large echogenic mass on the inferior aspect of the interatrial septum with infiltration of the coronary sinus, anterior mitral valve annulus, and aortic root. The mass protruded into the left ventricular outflow tract without causing valve obstruction. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging confirmed a bilobed interatrial mass measuring 5.6 × 3.1 × 3.8 cm with patchy late gadolinium enhancement of the lesion. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed a left hilar mass encasing the left upper lobe bronchus with extension into the left main pulmonary artery, a nodular soft tissue lesion along the anterior nasal septum, and no abdominal or pelvic disease. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showed a left paraclinoid mass lesion consistent with a meningioma and right Meckel cave lesions.

The patient's history and physical examination findings are consistent with a recurrence of her Burkitt lymphoma. The echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging findings show a large intracardiac mass that is infiltrating the coronary sinus, anterior mitral valve annulus, and aortic root. This mass is likely to be malignant and is causing symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, general malaise, and presyncope.

The urgent surgical resection of the intracardiac mass is the most appropriate treatment for this patient. This procedure will remove the malignant mass and relieve the symptoms that it is causing. The patient will need to be closely monitored after surgery for any recurrence of her lymphoma.

The other options are not appropriate for this patient. A thoracoscopic biopsy of the hilar mass would not be sufficient to treat the patient's intracardiac mass. Referencing the patient to an oncologist for further chemotherapy would not be appropriate at this time, as the patient needs to have the intracardiac mass removed urgently. An endomyocardial biopsy would not be helpful in this case, as the intracardiac mass is clearly seen on the echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging studies.

The patient's presentation is consistent with tuberculosis, which is a highly infectious disease spread through the air. The patient should be placed in airborne isolation to prevent the spread of infection to others. The recommended treatment for tuberculosis is a combination of four drugs: isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. These drugs are effective in killing the bacteria that cause tuberculosis.

The other options are incorrect because they are not the recommended treatment for tuberculosis. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a protein produced by the prostate gland. Measuring PSA levels is used to screen for prostate cancer. Cefepime and vancomycin are antibiotics that are used to treat bacterial infections. Doxycycline, rifampin, and streptomycin are antibiotics that are used to treat a variety of bacterial infections, including tuberculosis. However, they are not the recommended first-line treatment for tuberculosis.

In conclusion, the correct answer is: A. Place the patient in airborne isolation and begin ethambutol, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and rifampin. The other options are incorrect because they are not the recommended treatment for tuberculosis.

Explanation:
The results of the nerve conduction studies (NCS) and needle electromyography (EMG) are consistent with axonal polyneuropathy. This is because the NCS results show reduced sensory nerve action potentials (SNAPs) and motor nerve action potentials (MNAPs), while the EMG results show decreased recruitment of motor units and fibrillation potentials. These findings are consistent with a diffuse, distal, and symmetrical polyneuropathy, which is characteristic of axonal polyneuropathy.

Demyelinating polyneuropathy is characterized by slowed nerve conduction velocities (NCVs) and prolonged distal latencies (DLs). The NCS results in this case do not show these findings.

Polyradiculopathy is characterized by reduced amplitude of SNAPs and MNAPs, as well as abnormal F-waves. The NCS results in this case do not show these findings.

The results are not normal because they show evidence of nerve damage.

Explanation:

The patient's skin discoloration is most likely due to minocycline-induced pigmentation. Minocycline is a tetracycline antibiotic that can cause a blue-black discoloration of the skin, sclerae, and teeth. This discoloration is usually reversible after discontinuation of the drug.

Apixaban is an anticoagulant that is used to prevent blood clots. It is not known to cause skin discoloration.

Serum iron studies and serum niacin levels are not likely to be helpful in this case. The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with minocycline-induced pigmentation. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to discontinue minocycline.

Explanation: The patient has a history of daily soft contact lens wear and recently swam in a freshwater lake. These are risk factors for microbial keratitis, which is an infection of the cornea. The patient has a 2x2mm stromal opacity with no epithelial defects, which is consistent with a microbial keratitis. The anterior chamber has 1+ cells, which is also consistent with an infection. The IVCM images show a hyporeflective area in the stroma, which is consistent with an abscess. The most likely cause of this patient's microbial keratitis is a bacterium. Vancomycin is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that is effective against a variety of bacteria, including those that cause microbial keratitis. It is the best choice for empirical treatment in this patient while awaiting the results of the repeated corneal cultures.

Fluconazole is an antifungal medication that is effective against a variety of fungi. It is not the best choice for empirical treatment in this patient because the most likely cause of her microbial keratitis is a bacterium. Voriconazole is an antifungal medication that is effective against a variety of fungi, including those that cause microbial keratitis. It is not the best choice for empirical treatment in this patient because the most likely cause of her microbial keratitis is a bacterium. Polyhexamethylene biguanide and propamidine isethionate are antiseptics that are effective against a variety of bacteria and fungi. They are not the best choice for empirical treatment in this patient because the most likely cause of her microbial keratitis is a bacterium.

Macular schisis is a common finding in patients with glaucoma, and it is usually not associated with a significant decline in vision. In this case, the patient's vision is only mildly decreased, and there is no evidence of progressive disease. Therefore, observation is the most appropriate management option at this time.

Pars plana vitrectomy is a surgical procedure that is used to remove vitreous humor from the eye. It is typically used to treat conditions such as retinal detachment, vitreous hemorrhage, and macular edema. However, it is not typically used to treat macular schisis in patients with glaucoma.

Laser barricade is a procedure that is used to create a barrier between the vitreous humor and the retina. It is typically used to treat retinal detachment, but it is not typically used to treat macular schisis.

Genetic testing for the RS1 gene is a test that is used to detect mutations in the RS1 gene. Mutations in this gene can cause a condition called Stickler syndrome, which is a hereditary disorder that can cause vision problems, hearing loss, and joint problems. However, this patient does not have any symptoms of Stickler syndrome, so genetic testing is not necessary.

In conclusion, the most appropriate management option for this patient is observation.

The patient in the case has bilateral macular atrophy, hearing loss, and headache. These symptoms are consistent with a mitochondrial disease, which is a group of genetic disorders that affect the mitochondria, the energy-producing organelles in cells. Mitochondrial diseases can cause a variety of symptoms, including vision loss, hearing loss, and headache.

Genetic testing is the most accurate way to diagnose a mitochondrial disease. There are many different types of mitochondrial diseases, so it is important to test for the specific type that is suspected. Genetic testing can also be used to screen for mitochondrial diseases in people who are at risk for the condition, such as those who have a family history of mitochondrial disease.

The other options are incorrect because they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. A: Prescribe laboratory testing to investigate causes of intraocular inflammation would not be helpful in this case, as the patient's symptoms are not caused by inflammation. B: Genetic testing to rule out pattern dystrophy is also incorrect, as pattern dystrophy is a type of retinal dystrophy that does not typically cause hearing loss or headache. D: Genetic testing to rule out Stargardt disease is also incorrect, as Stargardt disease is a type of macular dystrophy that typically affects only one eye.

 16%|█▌        | 240/1525 [55:32<4:27:14, 12.48s/it]Answer: C. Follow-up without further intervention.

Explanation:
The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of dyslipidemia who presented to the emergency department with sudden vision loss in the right eye. She was found to have bilateral nonischemic central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO), with spontaneous reperfusion in the right eye. A hypercoagulability and autoimmune workup was negative, and a brain angiomagnetic resonance imaging scan was performed, which excluded central thrombosis.

The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are consistent with bilateral nonischemic CRVO. Nonischemic CRVO is a common retinal vascular occlusive disorder that is most often seen in patients with hypertension, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia. The most common presenting symptom is sudden vision loss, which is usually mild to moderate. The diagnosis is made based on ophthalmoscopic findings, which include retinal hemorrhages, cotton wool spots, and optic disc edema. Treatment is generally not necessary for nonischemic CRVO, as most patients will experience spontaneous improvement in their vision. However, patients with severe visual loss or those with signs of ischemia may benefit from treatment with panretinal photocoagulation.

In this case, the patient has a history of dyslipidemia, but no other risk factors for nonischemic CRVO. She has no evidence of ischemia on her ophthalmoscopic examination, and her vision has improved spontaneously. Therefore, it is reasonable to follow her up without further intervention.

A thoracoabdominopelvic computed tomography scan is not necessary in this case, as the patient has no evidence of an underlying systemic disorder. Panretinal photocoagulation is not indicated, as the patient does not have severe visual loss or signs of ischemia. Aspirin is not indicated in the treatment of nonischemic CRVO.

Therefore, the best course of management is to follow the patient up without further intervention.

 16%|█▌        | 241/1525 [55:48<4:52:09, 13.65s/it]The answer is C: Angiosarcoma.

Angiosarcoma is a rare type of cancer that starts in the blood vessels. It can occur anywhere in the body, but it is most common in the skin, soft tissues, and liver. Angiosarcoma is often aggressive and can be fatal.

The patient in the case has a history of hereditary bilateral retinoblastoma, which is a type of cancer that starts in the retina. Retinoblastoma is a genetic disease, and people with a family history of the disease are at increased risk of developing other types of cancer, including angiosarcoma.

The patient's symptoms, including unilateral leg swelling, are consistent with angiosarcoma. The CT venogram showed a 4.0 × 3.5 cm mass of likely vascular origin that was extending into the right common iliac vein. This is a characteristic finding of angiosarcoma.

The other possible diagnoses, leiomyosarcoma, liposarcoma, and hemangioendothelioma, are less likely in this patient. Leiomyosarcoma is a type of cancer that starts in the smooth muscle tissue. Liposarcoma is a type of cancer that starts in the fat tissue. Hemangioendothelioma is a type of cancer that starts in the endothelial cells that line the blood vessels. These cancers are more common in older people and are not associated with hereditary retinoblastoma.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for the patient in the case is angiosarcoma.

Explanation:
The most likely diagnosis is a parathyroid cyst. This is supported by the following findings:

* The patient is a middle-aged woman, which is the age group most commonly affected by parathyroid cysts.
* The cyst is located in the neck, which is the most common location for parathyroid cysts.
* The cyst is cystic on ultrasound, which is the typical appearance of a parathyroid cyst.
* The cyst is nonenhancing on CT scan, which is also the typical appearance of a parathyroid cyst.
* The cyst is associated with elevated parathyroid hormone levels, which is a characteristic finding of parathyroid cysts.

Branchial cleft cysts and thyroglossal duct cysts are both congenital anomalies that can occur in the neck. However, they are typically located in different areas of the neck than the parathyroid cyst in this case. Branchial cleft cysts are typically located in the anterior neck, while thyroglossal duct cysts are typically located in the midline of the neck.

Cystic thyroid nodules are a common type of thyroid nodule. However, they are typically solid on ultrasound, and they do not typically have the same association with elevated parathyroid hormone levels as parathyroid cysts.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is a parathyroid cyst.

 16%|█▌        | 243/1525 [56:15<4:57:48, 13.94s/it]Answer: C. Growing teratoma syndrome

Explanation:

The patient has a history of mixed nonseminomatous germ cell tumor (NSGCT) of the right testicle with metastasis to the retroperitoneal and mediastinal lymph nodes. He was treated with a right radical orchiectomy and 4 cycles of etoposide, ifosfamide, and cisplatin (VIP) chemotherapy with resulting reduction in metastatic tumor burden and normalization of α-fetoprotein and β-human chorionic gonadotropin. The patient’s neck swelling, which initially decreased in size while undergoing chemotherapy, progressively enlarged shortly after concluding treatment. He underwent magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography of the neck that showed a clearly defined, bulky supraclavicular mass confined to left neck levels 3, 4, and 5.

The most likely diagnosis is growing teratoma syndrome. Growing teratoma syndrome is a rare condition that occurs in patients with testicular cancer who have undergone chemotherapy and have had their tumor markers normalize. The syndrome is characterized by the growth of a residual teratoma, which is a type of germ cell tumor that contains mature tissue from all three germ cell layers. The teratoma can grow in the testis, the retroperitoneum, or the neck.

The diagnosis of growing teratoma syndrome is based on clinical findings, including a history of testicular cancer, normalization of tumor markers, and the presence of a growing mass. Imaging studies, such as CT scan or MRI, can be used to confirm the diagnosis and to determine the location and size of the tumor.

The treatment of growing teratoma syndrome is surgical resection of the tumor. In some cases, chemotherapy may also be used. The prognosis for patients with growing teratoma syndrome is generally good, with most patients achieving long-term remission.

The other possible diagnoses are not as likely in this case. Latent metastasis from the NSGCT is less likely because the patient's tumor markers have normalized. Supraclavicular lymphocele is a collection of lymph fluid in the supraclavicular fossa, which is the area above the clavicle. It is a rare complication of lymph node dissection, and it is not associated with a history of testicular cancer. Benign teratoma is a rare type of germ cell tumor that is usually found in the testis. It is not associated with a history of testicular cancer, and it does not grow after chemotherapy.

Explanation:
The patient's history of allogeneic stem cell transplant (allo-SCT) with a matched related donor for treatment of fms-like tyrosine kinase (FLT3) internal tandem duplication–mutated acute myeloid leukemia (AML), as well as the presence of a right vocal fold neoplasm crossing the posterior commissure with associated bilateral vocal fold motion impairment and obstruction of the glottic airway on flexible laryngoscopy, are all consistent with a diagnosis of extramedullary myeloid sarcoma (EMMS). EMMS is a rare, aggressive malignancy of myeloid hematopoietic cells that can occur in the setting of hematologic malignancy, such as AML. It is most commonly found in the skin, soft tissues, and bones, but can also occur in the larynx. The diagnosis of EMMS is made on the basis of histologic findings, which demonstrate a diffuse infiltrate of large cells with irregular nuclear contours, vesicular chromatin, and prominent nucleoli. Immunohistochemical stains show CD33, CD43, and CD117 positivity, with a subset positive for CD7 and myeloperoxidase. Stains are negative for CD3, CD20, and cytokeratin expression.

The treatment of EMMS is challenging and often involves a combination of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery. The prognosis for patients with EMMS is poor, with a median survival of approximately 1 year. However, there have been some reports of long-term survival, particularly in patients with localized disease at the time of diagnosis.

The patient has a history of nasal-type natural killer (NK)/T-cell lymphoma, which is a type of cancer that starts in the white blood cells called natural killer cells. NK/T-cell lymphoma can spread to the skin, and when it does, it can cause a rash that is similar to the one described in the case. The rash is characterized by widespread, nontender, erythematous patches and thin plaques, some with prominent overlying telangiectases and hyperpigmentation. A punch biopsy of a representative lesion revealed intravascular atypical cells, which is a characteristic finding of NK/T-cell lymphoma.

The other possible diagnoses are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Malignant neoplasm–associated microscopic polyangiitis is a rare autoimmune disorder that can cause inflammation of the small blood vessels. It is not associated with a rash like the one described in the case.
* Cutaneous coccidiomycosis is a fungal infection that can cause a rash. However, the rash is typically papular or nodular, rather than erythematous and plaque-like.
* Erythema nodosum is a type of inflammatory skin condition that can be caused by a variety of factors, including infection, medication, and autoimmune diseases. It is not associated with a history of NK/T-cell lymphoma.

 16%|█▌        | 246/1525 [56:59<5:11:48, 14.63s/it]The correct answer is D: Refer for LV lead repositioning.

The patient's worsening cardiomyopathy despite biventricular pacing is likely due to lead dislodgement. This is supported by the patient's history of right pulmonary fibrosis, which can lead to mediastinal shift and pacemaker lead dislodgement. The ECG shows alternating QRS morphologies, which is a sign of lead dislodgement. The pacemaker threshold testing also shows a change in QRS morphology as the output is reduced, which is another sign of lead dislodgement.

To confirm the diagnosis of lead dislodgement, a chest X-ray should be obtained. If the chest X-ray shows that the pacemaker lead is dislodged, the patient should be referred for LV lead repositioning.

Suppressing the premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) is not the best option because the PVCs are not the cause of the patient's worsening cardiomyopathy. Increasing the basal pacing rate is also not the best option because it will not address the underlying problem of lead dislodgement. Changing the LV pacing configuration is also not the best option because it will not address the underlying problem of lead dislodgement.

Therefore, the best option is to refer the patient for LV lead repositioning.

Trigeminal trophic syndrome is a rare condition that can occur after a stroke. It is characterized by the development of painful ulcers on the face, which are often associated with sensory loss and motor weakness. The ulcers can be very difficult to treat and may lead to significant disfigurement.

The most likely cause of the patient's ulcers is trigeminal trophic syndrome. This is supported by the patient's history of a stroke involving the right posterior circulation, which is the area of the brain that supplies blood to the face. The patient also has sensory loss and motor weakness on the right side of his face, which are typical findings in trigeminal trophic syndrome.

Giant cell arteritis is a rare inflammatory disease of the blood vessels that can affect the head and neck. It can cause headaches, scalp tenderness, and vision problems. However, it does not typically cause facial ulcers.

Trigeminal herpes zoster is a viral infection that can cause a painful rash on the face. It is often associated with a burning sensation, but it does not typically cause facial ulcers.

Pyoderma gangrenosum is a skin condition that can cause ulcers on the skin. It is often associated with inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and other autoimmune disorders. However, it does not typically occur after a stroke.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for the patient is trigeminal trophic syndrome.

 16%|█▋        | 248/1525 [57:25<4:55:25, 13.88s/it]The correct answer is C: Administer anticoagulant therapy.

The patient has retinal artery thrombosis and aortic valve vegetations. Both of these conditions are associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism. Anticoagulant therapy is the standard of care for patients with these conditions to prevent further thromboembolic events.

Intravenous antibiotics are not indicated in this case because there is no evidence of infection. Systemic corticosteroids are not indicated in this case because there is no evidence of an autoimmune disorder. Checking antiphospholipid antibody levels is not indicated in this case because the patient already has a positive test for antinuclear antibodies, which is a marker for an autoimmune disorder.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the rationale for each answer choice:

* A: Administer intravenous antibiotics.

Intravenous antibiotics are not indicated in this case because there is no evidence of infection. The patient has no fever, no leukocytosis, and no signs of infection on physical examination. The only abnormal laboratory finding is a mildly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), which is a non-specific marker of inflammation. In the absence of other evidence of infection, the ESR is not likely to be due to infection.

* B: Administer systemic corticosteroids.

Systemic corticosteroids are not indicated in this case because there is no evidence of an autoimmune disorder. The patient has a positive test for antinuclear antibodies (ANA), but this is a non-specific finding that can be seen in a variety of conditions, including autoimmune disorders, infections, and malignancies. The patient does not have any other clinical features of an autoimmune disorder, such as joint pain, rash, or serositis.

* C: Administer anticoagulant therapy.

Anticoagulant therapy is the standard of care for patients with retinal artery thrombosis and aortic valve vegetations. Both of these conditions are associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism. Anticoagulant therapy helps to prevent further thromboembolic events by reducing the risk of clot formation.

* D: Check antiphospholipid antibody levels.

Checking antiphospholipid antibody levels is not indicated in this case because the patient already has a positive test for antinuclear antibodies, which is a marker for an autoimmune disorder. Antiphospholipid antibodies are a group of antibodies that can be associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. However, they are not specific for any particular disorder, and they can be found in a variety of conditions, including autoimmune disorders, infections, and malignancies. The patient does not have any other clinical features of an autoimmune disorder, such as joint pain, rash, or serositis. Therefore, there is no need to check antiphospholipid antibody levels in this case.

The patient has a history of right ptosis and double vision that is worse at the end of the day. He also has a complete limitation of elevation of his right eye and a limitation of abduction in his left eye. These findings are consistent with third cranial nerve palsy.

A third cranial nerve palsy can be caused by a variety of conditions, including stroke, tumor, aneurysm, and trauma. In order to determine the cause of the patient's third cranial nerve palsy, it is necessary to obtain an imaging study of the brain. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits with contrast is the most sensitive and specific imaging study for the diagnosis of third cranial nerve palsy.

Complete blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein tests are not specific for third cranial nerve palsy and would not be helpful in determining the cause of the patient's symptoms. Computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the head may be helpful in the diagnosis of a third cranial nerve palsy if there is a suspicion of a mass lesion, such as a tumor or aneurysm. However, MRI of the orbits with contrast is the most sensitive and specific imaging study for the diagnosis of third cranial nerve palsy.

Ice pack test is not a diagnostic test for third cranial nerve palsy. It is a treatment for acute migraine headache.

The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with bilateral optic nerve edema secondary to idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). IIH is a diagnosis of exclusion, and other possible causes of optic nerve edema, such as neoplasm, infection, and autoimmune disease, should be ruled out. The patient's lumbar puncture results are consistent with IIH, with an elevated opening pressure and normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cell count and protein level.

Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that is used to reduce intracranial pressure in IIH. The patient's visual acuity and visual fields have improved with treatment, and his optic nerve pallor has stabilized. Therefore, it is reasonable to continue acetazolamide and monitor the patient's condition with repeated Humphrey visual fields testing and optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the retinal nerve fiber layer.

A: Advise tighter blood pressure control is not the correct answer because the patient's blood pressure is already well-controlled. In addition, there is no evidence that hypertension is the cause of the patient's optic nerve edema.

B: Repeated lumbar puncture with serologies is not the correct answer because the patient's lumbar puncture results are already normal. In addition, there is no evidence that the patient has an infection or autoimmune disease.

C: Start high-dose corticosteroids is not the correct answer because corticosteroids are not routinely used to treat IIH. In addition, there is no evidence that the patient has an inflammatory condition.

The patient has a history of severe frontal headaches and progressive blurred vision in the left eye more than the right eye for several weeks. No localizing signs were documented on neurologic examination. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain with and without contrast, magnetic resonance angiography of the head, and magnetic resonance venography of the head were obtained and were unremarkable. The result of a lumbar puncture showed 101 white blood cells per high-power field (75% lymphocytes). Results of syphilis serologic tests were negative. The patient was discharged with suspected viral meningitis.

At a follow-up visit in an ophthalmology clinic 1 week after discharge, visual acuity was 20/25 OD and counting fingers OS. There was no afferent pupillary defect, and an anterior segment examination was within normal limits. A dilated fundus examination showed numerous bilateral creamy-yellow lesions in the peripheral retina with discrete nummular lesions in the posterior pole. Fundus autofluorescence showed focal areas of hypoautofluorescence with surrounding hyperautofluorescence in both eyes. The patient continued to report severe and progressive headaches along with blurred vision. A review of systems was otherwise unremarkable.

The patient's clinical presentation is highly concerning for acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (APMPPE). APMPPE is a rare, self-limiting inflammatory disorder of the retina that typically affects young adults. The disease is characterized by the sudden onset of bilateral visual loss, often accompanied by headache. On fundus examination, patients with APMPPE typically have multiple creamy-yellow lesions in the peripheral retina. The lesions may coalesce to form larger patches, and they may eventually resolve without treatment.

The treatment of APMPPE is controversial. Some experts recommend treatment with high-dose intravenous corticosteroids, while others believe that treatment is not necessary in most cases. In the patient described above, the severity of the visual loss and the presence of active disease on fundus examination warrant treatment with high-dose intravenous corticosteroids. The patient should be admitted to the hospital and started on a course of methylprednisolone sodium succinate therapy. The patient should be monitored closely for signs of improvement, and the treatment should be tapered as soon as possible.

The other answers are incorrect because they do not provide the patient with the most appropriate level of care. Answer A would not be appropriate because it does not provide the patient with the necessary treatment. Answer B would not be appropriate because it does not provide the patient with the necessary level of care. Answer D would not be appropriate because it does not address the patient's underlying condition.

 17%|█▋        | 252/1525 [58:27<5:26:19, 15.38s/it]Answer: C. Acute tubular necrosis secondary to kidney melanoma metastasis

Explanation:

The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are consistent with acute tubular necrosis. He has a history of metastatic melanoma, which is a known risk factor for acute tubular necrosis. He developed acute abdominal pain and a rapidly rising lactic acid dehydrogenase level, which are both suggestive of acute tubular necrosis. His serum creatinine level increased from baseline of approximately 1 mg/dL to 5.8 mg/dL, which is a significant increase. His urinalysis showed casts, which are a characteristic finding of acute tubular necrosis. Nephrotoxic medications (omeprazole/pantoprazole) were discontinued, but his kidney function continued to deteriorate. This suggests that the acute tubular necrosis was not caused by the nephrotoxic medications. The top differential diagnoses at this juncture included contrast-induced nephropathy or immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI)–induced acute interstitial nephritis, and empirical high dose steroids were prescribed. However, the patient's kidney function continued to deteriorate despite observation and steroid treatment. This suggests that the acute tubular necrosis was not caused by contrast-induced nephropathy or immune checkpoint inhibitor–induced acute interstitial nephritis. A kidney biopsy was performed, which showed acute tubular necrosis with evidence of kidney melanoma metastasis. This confirms the diagnosis of acute tubular necrosis secondary to kidney melanoma metastasis.

The other options are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation. Immune checkpoint inhibitor–induced acute interstitial nephritis is a rare side effect of immune checkpoint inhibitors, which are a type of immunotherapy used to treat cancer. It is characterized by fever, rash, and kidney dysfunction. Postinfectious glomerulonephritis is a type of kidney disease that occurs after an infection. It is characterized by proteinuria, hematuria, and kidney dysfunction. Drug-induced acute tubular necrosis is a type of kidney disease that can be caused by a number of drugs, including antibiotics, chemotherapy drugs, and antifungal drugs. It is characterized by sudden onset of kidney dysfunction, which is often reversible with discontinuation of the offending drug.

 17%|█▋        | 253/1525 [58:43<5:31:32, 15.64s/it]The correct answer is: D. EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcer.

The patient is a 71-year-old man with a history of rheumatoid arthritis and type 2 diabetes. He presented to the otolaryngology team with 6 weeks’ history of pain and ulcers in the pharynx. He also complained of nasal regurgitation. He denied having any systemic symptoms. He took linagliptin, valsartan, and 15 mg of methotrexate weekly. He was a nonsmoker and consumed very little alcohol.

Clinical examination including flexible nasendoscopy revealed multiple shallow ulcers on the posterior wall of the nasopharynx. There was a large defect involving the entire soft palate on the left. There was no obvious mass or any exophytic lesion. The edges of the soft palate defect were smooth and clean (Figure 1). There were no cranial nerve palsies. There was no cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy. Findings of the remaining head and neck examinations were normal.

Results of laboratory investigations, including lactate dehydrogenase level and autoimmune antibody tests, such as antinuclear antibody and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, were negative. Screening test results for HIV and Treponema pallidum were also negative. The only positive result was immunoglobulin (Ig) G for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The IgM for EBV was not detected.

Magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck on short tau inversion recovery sequence confirmed the soft palate defect but also showed some thickening and hyperenhancement around the edges of the defect. There was no demonstrable nasopharyngeal mass. The hard palate was intact, and there were no significant cervical lymph nodes. The patient had biopsies taken from the ulcers and edges of the soft palate defect.

The biopsy results showed that the ulcers were consistent with EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcers. EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcers are a rare but well-described condition that can occur in patients with EBV infection. The ulcers are typically multiple, shallow, and painful. They can occur anywhere on the skin or mucous membranes, but they are most commonly seen on the oropharynx, lips, and tongue. The ulcers are usually self-limited, but they can sometimes be recurrent.

The treatment of EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcers is supportive. Pain medication and topical steroids can be helpful in relieving symptoms. In some cases, oral acyclovir or valacyclovir may be used to treat the underlying EBV infection.

The prognosis for patients with EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcers is generally good. The ulcers usually heal within a few weeks to months. However, the condition can be recurrent, and some patients may experience long-term problems with pain and scarring.

In the case of this patient, the most likely diagnosis is EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcers. The patient has a history of EBV infection, and the biopsy results show that the ulcers are consistent with this condition. The patient's other symptoms, such as pain and nasal regurgitation, are also consistent with EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcers.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a rare cancer that typically occurs in people who are from certain parts of the world, such as China and Southeast Asia. The patient in this case does not have any risk factors for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Autoimmune vasculitis is a condition that causes inflammation of the blood vessels. The patient in this case does not have any symptoms or signs of autoimmune vasculitis. Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that can occur anywhere on the skin. The patient in this case has ulcers on the inside of his mouth, which is not a typical location for squamous cell carcinoma.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcers. The patient has a history of EBV infection, and the biopsy results show that the ulcers are consistent with this condition. The patient's other symptoms, such as pain and nasal regurgitation, are also consistent with EBV-positive mucocutaneous ulcers. The other possible diagnoses are less likely.

 17%|█▋        | 254/1525 [58:59<5:35:53, 15.86s/it]Answer: B. Papillary thyroid carcinoma

Explanation:

The patient is a 50-year-old woman with a 2-month history of a neck mass that was associated with hoarseness of voice and globus sensation. Physical examination showed thyromegaly (right greater than left) with an approximately 5-cm palpable nodule in the right lobe. There was no tenderness or cervical lymphadenopathy. There was no prior radiation exposure to the head and neck area. Thyroid function test results were normal, and she did not take thyroid medications. A relative had received a diagnosis of papillary thyroid cancer at age 50 years. There was no other pertinent family history, including a history of multiple endocrine neoplasia. Ultrasonography results showed a multinodular goiter with a dominant 4.6-cm right thyroid nodule, 1.6-cm left-sided thyroid nodule, and suspect left level IV lymph node. Ultrasonography-guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy results showed papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) (Bethesda VI) with a BRAFV600E variation in the left nodule and lymph node, and atypia of undetermined significance (Bethesda III) with a suspicious Afirma genomic sequence classifier in the right nodule. She underwent total thyroidectomy with modified left lateral neck dissection. Gross examination of the specimen showed a 2.9-cm pale-tan, partially circumscribed, soft nodule in the right thyroid lobe; a 1.4-cm pale-tan, fibrotic, centrally brown nodule in the left lobe; and a 1.8-cm pale-tan, rubbery, partially circumscribed nodule in the isthmus. Histologic examination of the right thyroid lesion was performed (Figure), with ancillary testing.

[Image of a thyroid gland with a papillary thyroid carcinoma]

A, The right-sided nodule showed an organoid zellballen pattern, with sharp demarcation from thyroid tissue (hematoxylin-eosin). B, At higher magnification, the tumor cells exhibited amphophilic granular cytoplasm, round to oval nuclei, and salt-and-pepper chromatin (hematoxylin-eosin).

The most likely diagnosis is papillary thyroid carcinoma. This is supported by the patient's history, physical examination, laboratory findings, and imaging studies. The fine-needle aspiration biopsy results showed PTC, and the histologic examination of the surgical specimen confirmed the diagnosis. Papillary thyroid carcinoma is the most common type of thyroid cancer, accounting for approximately 80% of all cases. It is a slow-growing cancer that is usually curable with surgery.

The other possible diagnoses are medullary thyroid carcinoma, hyalinizing trabecular tumor, and thyroid paraganglioma. Medullary thyroid carcinoma is a neuroendocrine tumor that arises from the parafollicular C cells of the thyroid gland. It is associated with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) syndromes. Hyalinizing trabecular tumor is a rare, benign tumor that typically occurs in children and young adults. Thyroid paraganglioma is a neuroendocrine tumor that arises from the paraganglia, which are small collections of cells that are located near the thyroid gland. These tumors are very rare.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis in this case is papillary thyroid carcinoma. This is supported by the patient's history, physical examination, laboratory findings, imaging studies, and the results of the fine-needle aspiration biopsy and histologic examination.

Explanation:

The patient in this case presented with a 3-month history of episodic fever and painless cutaneous lesions on her lower limbs. The patient otherwise felt well and denied malaise, weight loss, or any other symptoms. She did not have any known benign inflammatory conditions. Physical examination showed indurated plaques with multiple telangiectasias on almost all the surface of the legs. Except for slightly elevated C-reactive protein levels, the results of other routine blood and urine tests were unremarkable. A skin biopsy specimen was obtained for histopathology examination.

The histopathologic analysis showed large round cells proliferating within dermal blood vessels. These cells had scanty cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli. This finding is consistent with the diagnosis of intravascular large B-cell lymphoma.

Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that arises from B cells within blood vessels. It is characterized by the proliferation of large, atypical B cells within the lumen of blood vessels. The disease most commonly affects older adults and typically presents with fever, weight loss, and fatigue. Cutaneous lesions are a common finding, and may be the initial manifestation of the disease.

The diagnosis of intravascular large B-cell lymphoma is made on the basis of clinical findings, laboratory tests, and histopathologic examination of a skin biopsy specimen. The treatment of intravascular large B-cell lymphoma is generally with chemotherapy. The prognosis for patients with intravascular large B-cell lymphoma is poor, with a median survival of approximately 1 year.

The other possible diagnoses in this case are:

* Intralymphatic histiocytosis: This is a rare condition characterized by the proliferation of histiocytes within lymphatic vessels. It most commonly affects children and young adults and typically presents with lymphadenopathy, fever, and weight loss.
* Reactive angioendotheliomatosis: This is a benign condition characterized by the proliferation of endothelial cells within blood vessels. It most commonly affects women and typically presents with cutaneous lesions, such as purpura and telangiectasias.
* Intralymphatic proliferation of T-cell lymphoid blasts: This is a rare condition characterized by the proliferation of T cells within lymphatic vessels. It most commonly affects children and young adults and typically presents with lymphadenopathy, fever, and weight loss.

The key features that distinguish intravascular large B-cell lymphoma from the other possible diagnoses in this case are the presence of large, atypical B cells within the lumen of blood vessels and the poor prognosis.

 17%|█▋        | 256/1525 [59:30<5:24:17, 15.33s/it]The correct answer is: D. Blau syndrome.

Explanation:

Blau syndrome is a rare, multisystem disorder characterized by ichthyosiform skin rash, joint pain, uveitis, and intellectual disability. It is caused by mutations in the SACS gene, which encodes a protein called salicyloylated N-linked glycoprotein. This protein is involved in the regulation of inflammation and apoptosis.

The patient in the case report presents with all of the characteristic features of Blau syndrome. The ichthyosiform rash is a classic finding in this condition. It is typically described as brownish plaques that are distributed on the lower extremities. The joint pain is also a common feature of Blau syndrome. It is usually symmetrical and affects the distal and proximal interphalangeal joints. Uveitis is another common finding in Blau syndrome. It can cause inflammation of the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. Intellectual disability is a variable feature of Blau syndrome. It can range from mild to severe.

The skin biopsy results are also consistent with Blau syndrome. The tissue biopsy revealed multiple circumscribed nests of granulomas that were infiltrating the dermis and subcutis. These granulomas are a characteristic finding in Blau syndrome. They are thought to be caused by an abnormal immune response.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain all of the features of the patient's presentation. Ichthyosis vulgaris is a common skin disorder that is characterized by dry, scaly skin. It is not associated with joint pain, uveitis, or intellectual disability. Netherton syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by ichthyosiform skin rash, hair loss, and atopic dermatitis. It is not associated with joint pain, uveitis, or intellectual disability. Pityriasis rubra pilaris is a chronic skin disorder that is characterized by scaling, erythema, and follicular plugging. It is not associated with joint pain, uveitis, or intellectual disability.

An intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP) is a mechanical circulatory support device that is used to improve cardiac output and blood pressure in patients who are in cardiogenic shock. It is a catheter that is inserted into the femoral artery and advanced into the aorta. The balloon is then inflated and deflated in synchrony with the patient's heartbeat. This helps to increase the blood flow to the coronary arteries and other vital organs.

In the case of the woman in the question, she is presenting with diffuse ST-segment elevation, a murmur, and an intracardiac mass. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (MI). MI is a condition in which the blood supply to the heart muscle is blocked, causing damage to the heart muscle. This can lead to cardiogenic shock, which is a life-threatening condition.

IABP is a standard treatment for cardiogenic shock. It has been shown to improve survival and reduce the risk of complications in patients with cardiogenic shock. In the case of the woman in the question, IABP would be the most appropriate treatment to improve her cardiac output and blood pressure.

The other options are not appropriate treatments for this patient. Dobutamine is a drug that is used to increase cardiac output. However, it is not a first-line treatment for cardiogenic shock. Nitrates and nifedipine are drugs that are used to reduce blood pressure. However, they are not effective in treating cardiogenic shock. Bisoprolol is a beta-blocker, which is a drug that is used to lower blood pressure. However, it is not appropriate to use a beta-blocker in a patient with cardiogenic shock. Beta-blockers can worsen the condition of patients with cardiogenic shock.

Explanation:
The patient has a white macular lesion with disc edema and scattered intraretinal and peripapillary hemorrhages and mixed venous and arterial sheathing. These findings are consistent with endophthalmitis, which is an infection of the vitreous humor. Intravitreal antibiotics are the first-line treatment for endophthalmitis. Vitreous tap and injection of intravitreal antibiotics are indicated in patients with endophthalmitis to provide high concentrations of antibiotics to the vitreous humor.

Reviewing medical records to see if gentamicin was given intraoperatively is not necessary in this case because the patient's symptoms and signs are not consistent with a toxic anterior segment syndrome (TASS), which is a rare but serious complication of intravitreal injection of gentamicin. Urgently referring the patient to the emergency department for embolic stroke workup is not necessary in this case because the patient's symptoms and signs are not consistent with an embolic stroke. Beginning valganciclovir hydrochloride therapy and sampling intraocular fluid for polymerase chain reaction testing is not necessary in this case because the patient's symptoms and signs are not consistent with viral retinitis.

Explanation:

The patient has nonclearing corneal edema after phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation. The most likely cause of this is endothelial decompensation, which can be diagnosed with an AS-OCT. If endothelial decompensation is confirmed, the patient may need an endothelial keratoplasty (Descemet stripping and endothelial keratoplasty or Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty).

A penetrating keratoplasty is a more invasive procedure that is not typically used for endothelial decompensation. Topical corticosteroids and hypertonic saline solution may help to reduce the corneal edema, but they are not likely to resolve the underlying problem.

 17%|█▋        | 260/1525 [1:00:13<4:23:55, 12.52s/it]The correct answer is A: Escalate systemic immunosuppression.

The patient has a history of antisynthetase syndrome, which is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of autoantibodies against aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. Patients with antisynthetase syndrome can develop a variety of clinical manifestations, including fever, rash, arthritis, myositis, and interstitial lung disease. In some cases, patients with antisynthetase syndrome can also develop a vasculitis, which can affect the skin, kidneys, lungs, and eyes.

The patient in this case presented with acute unilateral painless vision loss. On ophthalmic examination, he was found to have frosted branch angiitis, which is a characteristic finding of vasculitis. The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of vasculitis secondary to antisynthetase syndrome.

The treatment of vasculitis secondary to antisynthetase syndrome is with systemic immunosuppression. The first-line agents for this purpose are corticosteroids and cyclophosphamide. In some cases, other immunosuppressive agents, such as azathioprine or methotrexate, may be used.

In the case of the patient in this question, the appropriate next step in management is to escalate systemic immunosuppression. This can be done by increasing the dose of corticosteroids or by adding cyclophosphamide to the treatment regimen. The goal of treatment is to suppress the immune system and prevent further damage to the blood vessels.

Options B, C, and D are incorrect because they are not appropriate treatments for vasculitis secondary to antisynthetase syndrome. Diagnostic anterior chamber paracentesis and intravitreal foscarnet are procedures that are used to treat infections of the eye. Peripheral blood smear and flow cytometry are tests that are used to diagnose leukemia and lymphoma. Whole-body positron emission tomography–computed tomography is a test that is used to diagnose cancer.

Explanation:
The patient is a 29-year-old man with a 2-month history of rapidly growing, widespread, asymptomatic skin nodules all over his body. He denied having fever, chills, fatigue, night sweats, or weight loss. He had no history of malignant neoplasm or chemical exposure. Physical examination findings demonstrated numerous erythematous, indurated nodules involving the surface of his head, neck, torso, and extremities, without ulceration or scarring. Findings of systemic reviews were unremarkable, and there was no lymphadenopathy or peripheral nerve enlargement. Complete blood cell count with differential results were normal (white blood cell count, 6060/μL, normal range, 4500-10 000/μL; absolute neutrophils, 3070/μL, normal range, 1800-8300/μL [to convert cell counts to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001]). Serum lactate dehydrogenase level was elevated (279 U/L, normal range, 100-240 U/L [to convert to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167]). Biopsies from skin nodules and bone marrow were obtained.

The histologic findings from the skin biopsy showed a diffuse dermal infiltrate extending to the subcutis, with sparing of the upper papillary dermis. The infiltrate was characterized by immature myeloid cells. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of aleukemic cutaneous myeloid sarcoma.

Aleukemic cutaneous myeloid sarcoma is a rare, aggressive neoplasm of myeloid cells that typically presents with skin lesions. The lesions are often multiple and widespread, and they can be erythematous, indurated, or nodular. The diagnosis is made by biopsy, which shows a diffuse dermal infiltrate of immature myeloid cells. The treatment for aleukemic cutaneous myeloid sarcoma is chemotherapy, and the prognosis is poor.

The other options are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation. Cutaneous lymphoma is a neoplasm of lymphocytes, and it would not typically present with the skin lesions described in this case. Lepromatous leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae, and it would not typically present with the skin lesions described in this case. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem inflammatory disease, and it would not typically present with the skin lesions described in this case.

 17%|█▋        | 262/1525 [1:00:42<4:44:43, 13.53s/it]The answer is: **A. Acinic cell carcinoma.**

Explanation:

Acinic cell carcinoma is a rare type of salivary gland cancer that most commonly affects the parotid gland. It is typically a slow-growing tumor that is often diagnosed at an early stage. The most common symptom of acinic cell carcinoma is a painless mass in the parotid gland. Other symptoms may include facial nerve paralysis, pain, and drainage from the ear.

Acinic cell carcinoma is classified into three subtypes: well-differentiated, moderately differentiated, and poorly differentiated. Well-differentiated acinic cell carcinoma is the most common subtype and has the best prognosis. Moderately differentiated acinic cell carcinoma has an intermediate prognosis, and poorly differentiated acinic cell carcinoma has the worst prognosis.

The treatment for acinic cell carcinoma depends on the stage of the tumor. Early-stage tumors can be treated with surgery alone. More advanced tumors may require surgery followed by radiation therapy or chemotherapy.

The overall survival rate for acinic cell carcinoma is good. The 5-year survival rate for well-differentiated acinic cell carcinoma is over 90%. The 5-year survival rate for moderately differentiated acinic cell carcinoma is about 70%. The 5-year survival rate for poorly differentiated acinic cell carcinoma is about 50%.

The following are the reasons why Acinic cell carcinoma is the most likely diagnosis in this case:

* The patient is a 9-year-old boy, which is the age group that is most commonly affected by acinic cell carcinoma.
* The patient has a painless mass in the parotid gland, which is the most common symptom of acinic cell carcinoma.
* The patient's mass was found to be a well-circumscribed, solid nodule with tan-white, glistening cut surfaces, which is the typical appearance of acinic cell carcinoma on gross examination.
* The patient's mass was found to be a multilobulated, complex lesion with prominent stromal fibrosis and collections of ductal structures with varying degrees of cystic change, which is the typical appearance of acinic cell carcinoma on microscopic examination.
* The patient's mass was found to contain acinar cells with brightly eosinophilic intracytoplasmic granules, which is the characteristic finding of acinic cell carcinoma on microscopic examination.

The other possible diagnoses, mammary analog secretory carcinoma, sclerosing polycystic adenoma, and myoepithelial carcinoma, are less likely in this case because they are not as common as acinic cell carcinoma. Additionally, the patient's mass does not have the typical appearance of these other tumors on gross or microscopic examination.

The patient has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, which are both risk factors for herpes simplex virus infection. She also has a history of external hemorrhoids, which can be a portal of entry for herpes simplex virus. The perianal ulcers are tender and round, which are typical of herpes simplex virus infection. The histopathologic examination of the biopsy specimen shows epidermal ulceration and mixed dermal inflammation, which is also consistent with herpes simplex virus infection. The presence of enlarged dermal fibroblasts and endothelial cells with glassy cytoplasm and intranuclear inclusions is a classic finding in herpes simplex virus infection.

Amebic colitis is a rare infection that is caused by the protozoan Entamoeba histolytica. It is most commonly seen in tropical and subtropical areas. The most common symptoms of amebic colitis are diarrhea, abdominal pain, and fever. The diagnosis is made by stool microscopy or stool culture. Amebic colitis is treated with antibiotics.

Cytomegalovirus infection is a common viral infection that is most often seen in people who are immunocompromised. The most common symptoms of cytomegalovirus infection are fever, fatigue, and lymphadenopathy. The diagnosis is made by serologic testing or tissue biopsy. Cytomegalovirus infection is treated with antiviral medications.

Cutaneous Crohn disease is a rare skin manifestation of Crohn disease. It is characterized by the development of erythematous, papular, or nodular lesions on the skin. The lesions are often painful and may be associated with fever, fatigue, and weight loss. The diagnosis is made by biopsy. Cutaneous Crohn disease is treated with topical and systemic corticosteroids.

In conclusion, the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of herpes simplex virus infection.

Explanation:

* Lupus vulgaris is a chronic, progressive form of cutaneous tuberculosis that typically presents as a single, well-demarcated, indurated, erythematous plaque with telangiectasias.
* The lesion is often located on the face, ears, or neck, and it may be associated with regional lymphadenopathy.
* Histopathologic examination reveals noncaseating granulomas composed of histiocytes and Langhans giant cells surrounded by a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate.
* The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of positive skin tests for tuberculosis (e.g., the Mantoux test).
* Treatment consists of a combination of antituberculous drugs and surgical excision.

The other options are incorrect because:

* Lupus pernio is a chronic, granulomatous skin disease that is associated with sarcoidosis.
* Granulomatous mycosis fungoides is a rare, T-cell lymphoma that typically presents as a slowly progressive, scaly plaque.
* Leishmania recidivans is a parasitic infection that is characterized by the development of cutaneous ulcers.

The patient is a teenage girl with a history of recurrent episodes of chest and neck palpitations accompanied by headaches for 3 years. She had no specific medical or family history and had no treatment. A resting electrocardiogram (ECG) while symptomatic showed a wide QRS complex rhythm at a rate of 81 beats per minute. After a short walk, symptoms disappeared and another ECG was recorded, which showed a normal sinus rhythm. Physical examination and transthoracic echocardiography results were normal.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with an arrhythmia that is benign and likely to resolve spontaneously. The ECG findings are also consistent with a benign arrhythmia, such as a supraventricular tachycardia (SVT). SVTs are the most common type of arrhythmia in children and adolescents, and they are usually harmless. In most cases, SVTs will resolve on their own without treatment.

In this case, the patient's symptoms are mild and infrequent, and she has no underlying medical conditions. Therefore, the best course of action is to reassure the patient and follow her closely without initiating any treatment. If the patient's symptoms worsen or become more frequent, then further evaluation and treatment may be necessary.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Option B, medical therapy with propafenone or flecainide, is not appropriate because these medications are not indicated for the treatment of benign arrhythmias. Option C, electrophysiology study with or without catheter ablation, is not appropriate because this is a major procedure that is associated with risks and should only be used in patients with life-threatening arrhythmias. Option D, medical therapy with β-blockers, diltiazem, or verapamil, is not appropriate because these medications are not indicated for the treatment of benign arrhythmias.

Therefore, the correct answer is A: Therapeutic abstention and patient reassurance.

Explanation:

Fecal calprotectin is a protein found in white blood cells. It is released in the stool when there is inflammation in the gut. Measuring fecal calprotectin is a non-invasive way to test for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.

The patient in this case has a history of diarrhea and a rash. These are two of the most common symptoms of IBD. The patient also has a low body mass index, which is another risk factor for IBD.

Measuring fecal calprotectin is the next step in the diagnostic workup for IBD. If the fecal calprotectin level is elevated, it suggests that the patient has IBD. Further testing, such as colonoscopy or CT scan, may be needed to confirm the diagnosis.

The other options are not as likely to be the next step in the diagnostic workup for this patient. Fecal ova and parasites are a common cause of diarrhea, but the patient does not have any other symptoms of parasitic infection, such as fever, abdominal pain, or weight loss. Serum niacin level is a test for vitamin deficiency, but the patient does not have any symptoms of vitamin deficiency. Serum antitissue transglutaminase antibody is a test for celiac disease, but the patient does not have any symptoms of celiac disease, such as abdominal pain, bloating, and diarrhea.

Explanation:

The patient's history of alcohol use disorder puts him at risk for nutritional deficiencies, including vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A is essential for the maintenance of epithelial integrity. A deficiency of vitamin A can lead to a condition called xerophthalmia, which is characterized by dry, scaly skin, night blindness, and corneal ulcerations.

The patient's presentation is consistent with xerophthalmia. He has a new epithelial defect and subepithelial bullae in an adjacent location, as well as dull conjunctival reflexes and bulbar conjunctival lesions in both eyes. Additionally, both eyes have patchy interpalpebral results on lissamine green staining of the conjunctiva and clinically significant punctate epithelial erosions of the cornea with fluorescein staining.

The first step in the management of xerophthalmia is to identify and correct the underlying cause of the vitamin A deficiency. In this case, the patient's history of alcohol use disorder suggests that he may be malnourished. Therefore, the next step in the management of this patient would be to obtain serum vitamin levels to confirm the diagnosis of vitamin A deficiency. If the diagnosis is confirmed, the patient would be started on oral vitamin A supplementation.

The other options are not appropriate for this patient. Option A, continuing treatment with current topical antibiotics, is not appropriate because the patient's corneal ulcer is not due to a bacterial infection. Option B, repeating the corneal cultures with Lowenstein-Jensen medium, is not appropriate because the patient's corneal ulcer is not due to a fungal infection. Option C, obtaining serum anti-Ro and anti-La tests, is not appropriate because the patient does not have a systemic autoimmune disease.

The patient has a history of hematologic malignancies, and the physical examination and imaging findings are consistent with orbital pseudotumor. Orbital pseudotumor is a non-neoplastic inflammatory condition of the orbit that can affect the extraocular muscles. The most common treatment for orbital pseudotumor is high-dose intravenous steroids. However, in this patient, the imaging findings are concerning for a neoplastic process, such as lymphoma. Therefore, the next best step is to perform an extraocular muscle biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment.

The other options are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate treatment for orbital pseudotumor. Option A, prescribing high-dose intravenous steroids, is the most common treatment for orbital pseudotumor. However, in this patient, the imaging findings are concerning for a neoplastic process, such as lymphoma. Therefore, high-dose intravenous steroids are not the most appropriate treatment. Option B, performing staged bilateral orbital decompressions, is a surgical treatment that is used to relieve pressure in the orbit. However, this treatment is not necessary in the majority of cases of orbital pseudotumor. Option D, referring for bilateral orbital external beam radiation, is a treatment that is used to treat neoplastic processes, such as lymphoma. However, this treatment is not the first-line treatment for orbital pseudotumor.

Explanation:
The patient has a right middle cranial fossa mass extending into the Meckel cave and abutting the right trigeminal nerve. This is most likely a meningioma, which is a slow-growing tumor that arises from the meninges, the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. Meningiomas are the most common primary brain tumor in adults, and they are usually benign (noncancerous). However, they can cause symptoms if they press on or invade surrounding structures, such as the brain or cranial nerves.

The patient's symptoms of worsening floaters, CME, and trigeminal neuralgia are all consistent with a meningioma. The CME is likely due to the tumor's pressure on the optic nerve, and the trigeminal neuralgia is likely due to the tumor's pressure on the trigeminal nerve.

The next step in management is to obtain a biopsy of the tumor to confirm the diagnosis and to determine whether the tumor is malignant. This can be done with a temporal craniotomy, which is a surgical procedure to open the skull and access the tumor. A biopsy is necessary to determine the best course of treatment, which may include surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Reassuring the patient and doing nothing would not be appropriate, as the tumor is likely to continue to grow and cause further symptoms. Giving an intravitreal anti-VEGF injection would not be effective in treating a meningioma, as anti-VEGF injections are used to treat macular edema, which is a swelling of the macula, the part of the retina responsible for central vision. Performing a vitrectomy with cytology and immunohistochemistry would not be appropriate, as these procedures are used to diagnose and treat retinal disorders, not brain tumors.

Explanation:

The most likely cause of the patient's orbital swelling is an inflammatory reaction to the intra-arterial chemotherapy. This is supported by the patient's history of recent IAC, the presence of periorbital swelling and erythema, and the absence of fever or other signs of infection.

Systemic corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for this condition. They help to reduce inflammation and edema. In addition, they may help to prevent retinal detachment.

Intravenous vancomycin and cefepime are broad-spectrum antibiotics that are used to treat bacterial infections. However, there is no evidence that the patient has an infection. In fact, the patient's blood cultures were negative for bacteria. Therefore, antibiotics are not necessary in this case.

Examination under anesthesia is not necessary in this case. The patient's orbital swelling is not severe enough to warrant a surgical procedure. In addition, the patient has already undergone a recent eye surgery. Therefore, it is important to avoid further unnecessary surgery.

Observing the patient is not an appropriate management strategy. The patient's orbital swelling is significant and may lead to complications, such as retinal detachment. Therefore, it is important to treat the patient with systemic corticosteroids.

Explanation: The patient is a 16-year-old boy with acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage who developed tender, 1- to 2-cm erythematous plaques and nodules during treatment with chemotherapy. The lesions were noted on day 2 of the fourth cycle of a chemotherapy regimen comprising fludarabine, cytarabine, and filgrastim (G-CSF). Initially present over the distal limbs, palms, and soles, the lesions progressed to the proximal limbs and lower trunk during 24 hours. The patient developed a fever, which was extensively investigated. Intravenous cefotaxime was commenced, but because no infectious source was identified, the fever was thought to be secondary to cytarabine.

The results of a complete examination of blood drawn at lesion onset demonstrated a total white cell count of 6330/μL (to convert to 109/L multiply by 0.001) with absolute neutrophil count of 6140/μL, more than the previous day’s counts of 3210/μL and 1720/μL, respectively. The blood film demonstrated increased neutrophil granulation with a left shift. A punch biopsy from the upper arm was performed.

The histopathologic findings of the biopsy showed a leukocytoclastic neutrophilic infiltrate in the deeper dermis, around appendage structures and coiled eccrine glands, and into the interstitium. This finding is consistent with a diagnosis of leukemia cutis.

Leukemia cutis is a cutaneous manifestation of leukemia that occurs in approximately 5% of patients with acute leukemia. It is characterized by the presence of erythematous, tender papules, plaques, or nodules on the skin. The lesions are often associated with fever, chills, and malaise.

The diagnosis of leukemia cutis is made based on the clinical presentation and histopathologic findings. The treatment of leukemia cutis is aimed at the underlying leukemia. In some cases, local therapy with corticosteroids or cryotherapy may be necessary.

The other options are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation and histopathologic findings.

Sweet syndrome is a neutrophilic dermatosis that is characterized by the presence of fever, neutrophilic infiltration of the skin, and systemic symptoms. It is not associated with leukemia.

Urticaria is a common skin condition that is characterized by the presence of wheals (raised, red, itchy bumps). It is not associated with leukemia.

Neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis is a rare skin condition that is characterized by the presence of tender, erythematous nodules on the palms, soles, and axillae. It is not associated with leukemia.

Explanation:

Cervical necrotizing fasciitis is a rare but life-threatening infection of the soft tissues of the neck. It is caused by bacteria that enter the body through a break in the skin, such as a cut or abrasion. The bacteria then spread rapidly through the soft tissues, causing inflammation, necrosis, and death of the tissue.

The patient in the case presented with bilateral neck swelling that had developed over 24 hours. The swelling was global, bilateral, and painless, and was most severe on the left side. There was also a rash, which is a common finding in patients with cervical necrotizing fasciitis. The patient had no dyspnea nor dysphagia, but did have a discrete dysphonia. He had no fever.

The patient's history and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of cervical necrotizing fasciitis. The CT scan showed a large retropharyngeal fluid accumulation, which is a characteristic finding in this condition. The patient's white blood cell count was elevated, which is another common finding in patients with cervical necrotizing fasciitis.

Cervical necrotizing fasciitis is a medical emergency and requires immediate treatment. Treatment typically involves surgery to remove the infected tissue and antibiotics to kill the bacteria. The patient in the case underwent surgery and was treated with antibiotics. He made a good recovery and was discharged from the hospital after a week.

The other possible diagnoses in the case are spontaneous lymphorrhea, angioneurotic edema, and Quincke edema. Spontaneous lymphorrhea is a rare condition that occurs when there is a leak of lymph fluid from the lymph nodes. Angioneurotic edema is a type of allergic reaction that causes swelling of the skin, mucous membranes, and other tissues. Quincke edema is a severe form of angioneurotic edema that can cause swelling of the throat and airway.

The patient in the case did not have any of the typical symptoms of spontaneous lymphorrhea, angioneurotic edema, or Quincke edema. The patient's history and physical examination findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of cervical necrotizing fasciitis.

Explanation:
The patient's history, physical examination, and imaging findings are most consistent with spontaneous airway hemorrhage with obstructive hematoma. The patient's history of factor V Leiden deficiency and atrial fibrillation places him at increased risk for spontaneous bleeding. He also has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which can predispose to airway obstruction. The patient's physical examination reveals substantial dysphonia, fullness in the left submandibular region, and ecchymosis of the lateral left neck extending toward the midline. These findings are consistent with an expanding hematoma in the neck. The patient's imaging studies reveal a large, intermediate-density, modestly enhancing, left-sided submucosal lesion extending from the nasopharynx inferiorly to the glottis with encroachment on the airway. These findings are also consistent with a hematoma in the airway. The patient's clinical presentation and imaging findings are most consistent with spontaneous airway hemorrhage with obstructive hematoma. The other options are less likely. An abscess is a collection of pus that forms in a body cavity. Abscesses can occur in the neck, but they are typically not associated with the symptoms that this patient is experiencing. Head and neck malignant neoplasms are a group of cancers that can occur in the head and neck region. These cancers can cause a variety of symptoms, including dyspnea, dysphonia, and dysphagia. However, they are not typically associated with ecchymosis of the neck. Angioedema is a sudden swelling of the skin and underlying tissues. It can occur in the face, neck, lips, tongue, and throat. Angioedema can be life-threatening if it blocks the airway. However, it is not typically associated with the other symptoms that this patient is experiencing.

Explanation:
Lichen striatus is a common, benign, self-limited skin condition characterized by linear, unilateral, erythematous, scaly plaques. It is most common in children, but can occur at any age. The cause is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder. Lichen striatus is usually diagnosed based on the clinical presentation. Biopsies may be performed to rule out other conditions. There is no specific treatment for lichen striatus. The condition usually resolves on its own within a few months to a year.

Idiopathic follicular mucinosis is a rare, chronic, benign skin condition characterized by the accumulation of mucin in the hair follicles. It can occur at any age, but is most common in adults. The cause is unknown. Idiopathic follicular mucinosis is usually diagnosed based on the clinical presentation. Biopsies may be performed to confirm the diagnosis. There is no specific treatment for idiopathic follicular mucinosis. The condition usually resolves on its own within a few years.

Follicular mucinous nevus is a rare, benign skin condition characterized by the presence of mucin-filled cysts in the hair follicles. It is most common in children and young adults. The cause is unknown. Follicular mucinous nevus is usually diagnosed based on the clinical presentation. Biopsies may be performed to confirm the diagnosis. There is no specific treatment for follicular mucinous nevus. The condition usually resolves on its own within a few years.

Trichodysplasia spinulosa is a rare, genetic disorder characterized by the presence of short, thick, spiny hairs. It can occur at any age, but is most common in children. The cause is a mutation in the gene PADI3. Trichodysplasia spinulosa is usually diagnosed based on the clinical presentation. Biopsies may be performed to confirm the diagnosis. There is no specific treatment for trichodysplasia spinulosa. The condition is usually lifelong.

In the case presented, the patient is a girl younger than 2 years who presented with a 1-year history of slightly pruritic lesions involving her face. The lesions are multiple, skin-colored and erythematous follicular papules, 1 to 2 mm in diameter, distributed in a segmental pattern on the right side of the forehead, as well as the dorsum and tip of the nose. A small, excoriated plaque was also noted on the right malar area. No mucosal lesions were present, and the rest of the physical examination findings were unremarkable. A complete hematological and biochemical survey, including blood cell count, liver and renal function tests, C-reactive protein levels, thyroid function, rheumatoid factor, and antinuclear antibodies, disclosed no abnormalities. Two skin punch biopsies were taken from the forehead and nose. Representative histopathological features are shown in Figure 1B and C.

The clinical presentation and histopathological findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of lichen striatus. Lichen striatus is a common, benign, self-limited skin condition characterized by linear, unilateral, erythematous, scaly plaques. It is most common in children, but can occur at any age. The cause is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder. Lichen striatus is usually diagnosed based on the clinical presentation. Biopsies may be performed to rule out other conditions. There is no specific treatment for lichen striatus. The condition usually resolves on its own within a few months to a year.

Idiopathic follicular mucinosis, follicular mucinous nevus, and trichodysplasia spinulosa are all rare, chronic, benign skin conditions. They are not characterized by the linear, unilateral, erythematous, scaly plaques that are characteristic of lichen striatus. Therefore, they are not the correct diagnosis in this case.

A Becker nevus is a congenital hamartomatous lesion of melanocytes and nerve fibers that presents as a hyperpigmented, hypertrichotic plaque. It is typically found on the upper trunk and is more common in males.

The patient in the case presentation has a well-defined, firm, yellow to skin-colored multinodular hypertrichotic plaque on the left lower back. The lesion is consistent with a Becker nevus. The biopsy shows a diffuse dermal infiltration of spindle cells, predominantly encircling terminal folliculosebaceous units. This is also consistent with a Becker nevus.

The other possible diagnoses are incorrect. A neurocristic hamartoma is a congenital lesion of neural crest cells that presents as a firm, subcutaneous mass. It is typically found on the head and neck. A smooth muscle hamartoma is a congenital lesion of smooth muscle cells that presents as a firm, subcutaneous mass. It is typically found on the extremities. A plexiform neurofibroma is a type of neurofibroma that is characterized by a large, diffuse mass of nerve fibers. It is typically found in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1.

In conclusion, the patient in the case presentation has a Becker nevus.

Explanation:

The patient presented with a right atrial mass, which is a potentially life-threatening condition. The most important next step in the management of this patient is to obtain a definitive diagnosis of the mass. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most accurate imaging modality for the evaluation of cardiac masses. It can provide detailed information about the size, shape, location, and internal architecture of the mass, as well as its relationship to the surrounding structures. This information can be used to determine the nature of the mass and to plan for further management.

Positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET–CT) is a nuclear medicine imaging technique that is used to detect cancer. It is not as accurate as MRI for the evaluation of cardiac masses. Right heart catheterization for biopsy is a procedure that is used to obtain tissue samples from the right heart. It is not the best next step in the management of this patient because it is an invasive procedure that carries a risk of complications. Transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is a type of ultrasound that is used to evaluate the heart. It is not as accurate as MRI for the evaluation of cardiac masses.

Therefore, the best next step in the management of this patient is to obtain a cardiac MRI.

The patient is presenting with a purpuric rash, which can be a sign of a number of different conditions, including vasculitis, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and thrombocytopenic purpura. In order to determine the underlying cause of the rash, it is important to order a number of laboratory tests, including antinuclear antibody (ANA), antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA), and complement levels.

ANA is an antibody that can be found in the blood of people with autoimmune diseases, such as lupus erythematosus. ANCA is an antibody that can be found in the blood of people with vasculitis, a condition in which inflammation occurs in the blood vessels. Complement levels are a measure of the body's ability to fight infection.

If the patient's ANA and ANCA levels are elevated, this suggests that the patient may have an autoimmune disease or vasculitis. If the patient's complement levels are low, this suggests that the patient may have DIC.

Ordering these laboratory tests will help to narrow down the possible causes of the patient's rash and allow the physician to determine the best course of treatment.

A skin biopsy is not necessary in this case, as the rash is not suspicious for malignancy. Lower extremity duplex ultrasound is not necessary in this case, as the patient does not have any signs or symptoms of deep vein thrombosis. Antibiotic therapy is not necessary in this case, as the patient does not have any signs or symptoms of infection.

Explanation:

The patient has a 18-month history of dorsal foot lesions that have not responded to topical antifungal or cryotherapy. The lesions are well-circumscribed, scaly plaques with cobblestone surfaces. The patient is positive for hepatitis C virus. The most likely diagnosis is psoriasis. Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes the skin cells to grow too quickly. This results in thick, red, scaly patches on the skin. Psoriasis can affect any part of the body, but it is most commonly found on the elbows, knees, scalp, and lower back. There is no cure for psoriasis, but there are treatments that can help to control the symptoms.

The next step in management is to perform an incisional biopsy of the lesion. This will allow the doctor to confirm the diagnosis of psoriasis and rule out other possible causes of the lesions. The biopsy will also help the doctor to determine the best course of treatment.

Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid is a combination antibiotic that is used to treat bacterial infections. It is not effective against psoriasis, which is a non-infectious autoimmune disease.

A computed tomography (CT) scan is a medical imaging test that uses X-rays to create detailed images of the inside of the body. A CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis is not necessary to diagnose psoriasis.

Oral zinc therapy is a treatment that is used to treat zinc deficiency. Zinc deficiency can cause a variety of symptoms, including skin problems. However, zinc deficiency is not a cause of psoriasis.

Therefore, the next step in management is to perform an incisional biopsy of the lesion.

The patient's APOE genotype indicates that he is at increased risk for Alzheimer's disease, but it does not mean that he will definitely develop the disease. In fact, many people with the APOE ɛ4 allele never develop Alzheimer's disease. The patient's current cognitive function is normal, and his physical and neurological examinations are normal. Therefore, there is no need to order additional tests at this time.

The patient's concerns should be addressed and he should be given information about Alzheimer's disease and his risk for the disease. He should also be told that there are things he can do to reduce his risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, such as exercising, eating a healthy diet, and staying mentally and socially active.

The patient should be followed up in 1 year to assess his cognitive function and to determine if he has developed any symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.

The other options are incorrect because:

* Option A is incorrect because FDG-PET scans are not typically used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease in people who are not showing symptoms of the disease.
* Option B is incorrect because CSF testing is not typically used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease in people who are not showing symptoms of the disease.
* Option D is incorrect because genetic counseling is not typically recommended for people who are not showing symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.

The patient has bilateral ptosis and ophthalmoplegia, which are signs of a third cranial nerve palsy. A third cranial nerve palsy can be caused by a variety of conditions, including stroke, tumor, infection, and trauma.

A: Perform surgical repair of ptosis with frontalis sling is not the correct answer because the patient's ptosis is likely caused by a third cranial nerve palsy, which is not a surgical condition.

C: Order an electrocardiogram is not the correct answer because the patient's ptosis and ophthalmoplegia are not likely caused by a cardiac condition.

The patient in this case has a number of features that suggest a diagnosis of systemic vasculitis, including retinopathy, cerebral ring-enhancing lesions, and kidney insufficiency. Systemic vasculitis is a group of disorders characterized by inflammation of the blood vessels. It can affect any part of the body, but the most common sites are the kidneys, lungs, heart, and brain.

The diagnosis of systemic vasculitis is made on the basis of a combination of clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The gold standard for diagnosis is a biopsy of the affected tissue, which can show the characteristic inflammation of the blood vessels.

In this case, the patient has already had a number of tests, including blood tests, imaging studies, and a CSF culture. These tests have not been able to provide a definitive diagnosis. The next step in the evaluation should be a brain or kidney biopsy. This will allow the pathologist to examine the affected tissue and make a definitive diagnosis of systemic vasculitis.

The other options are not correct because they are not the next step in the evaluation of a patient with suspected systemic vasculitis.

B. Genetic sequencing is not the next step in the evaluation of a patient with suspected systemic vasculitis because there is no specific genetic test for this condition.

C. A second CSF culture is not the next step in the evaluation of a patient with suspected systemic vasculitis because the first CSF culture was negative.

The patient is a 77-year-old man with a history of multiple skin malignant neoplasms who presents with painless, progressive blurring of vision in his left eye. His best-corrected visual acuity is 20/40 OS, and the patient reports that his vision has waxed and waned over several months. Slitlamp examination findings are notable for a grayish cornea opacity that appeared to be lusterless, abutting the nasal limbus and extending into the visual axis. There was no apparent conjunctival erythema or appreciable feeder vessels at the limbus. The rest of the examination findings, including the fundus, were unremarkable. Anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) indicated that the hyperreflective corneal lesion did not involve the cornea stroma.

The differential diagnosis for this patient's presentation includes superficial keratitis, epithelial basement membrane dystrophy, and in situ corneal squamous cell carcinoma. Superficial keratitis is a common inflammatory condition of the cornea that can be caused by a variety of factors, including viral infections, bacteria, and allergies. Epithelial basement membrane dystrophy is a degenerative condition of the cornea that can lead to the formation of epithelial defects. In situ corneal squamous cell carcinoma is a precancerous condition of the cornea that can progress to invasive carcinoma if left untreated.

The next step in the management of this patient is to perform a superficial keratectomy to confirm the diagnosis by histopathologic examination. Superficial keratectomy is a minimally invasive procedure that involves removing a small piece of the cornea for examination under a microscope. This procedure is often used to diagnose and treat superficial keratitis, epithelial basement membrane dystrophy, and in situ corneal squamous cell carcinoma.

Calcium chelation with EDTA therapy is a treatment option for in situ corneal squamous cell carcinoma, but it is not the first-line treatment option. Penetrating keratoplasty is a surgical procedure that involves replacing the diseased cornea with a healthy cornea from a donor. This procedure is not indicated for the management of superficial keratitis, epithelial basement membrane dystrophy, or in situ corneal squamous cell carcinoma.

Observation with follow-up for changes over the next 6 to 12 months is not an appropriate management option for this patient. The patient's vision has been progressively declining, and he has a history of multiple skin malignant neoplasms. It is important to rule out a malignancy as the cause of the patient's vision loss.

It is most common in men over the age of 50, and is often associated with atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and seborrheic dermatitis. The exact cause of folliculitis decalvans is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder.

The diagnosis of folliculitis decalvans is made based on the clinical presentation and a skin biopsy. Treatment is typically with oral antibiotics, such as minocycline or doxycycline, and topical steroids. In severe cases, oral corticosteroids may be necessary.

Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that starts in the squamous cells, which are the flat, dead cells that make up the outer layer of the skin. It is the second most common type of skin cancer, after basal cell carcinoma. Squamous cell carcinoma can occur anywhere on the skin, but is most common on sun-exposed areas, such as the face, neck, ears, and hands.

The symptoms of squamous cell carcinoma vary depending on the size and location of the tumor. Early on, it may appear as a small, red, scaly bump. As the tumor grows, it may become larger and more raised, with a rough, scaly surface. In some cases, it may bleed or ulcerate.

The diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma is made based on a biopsy of the lesion. Treatment depends on the size, location, and stage of the tumor. In early cases, the tumor may be removed with surgery or laser therapy. In more advanced cases, radiation therapy or chemotherapy may be necessary.

Erosive pustular dermatosis is a rare, chronic, inflammatory skin disorder that is characterized by the development of erosions and pustules on the skin. It is most common in women over the age of 50, and is often associated with autoimmune disorders, such as lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. The exact cause of erosive pustular dermatosis is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder.

The diagnosis of erosive pustular dermatosis is made based on the clinical presentation and a skin biopsy. Treatment is typically with oral corticosteroids, such as prednisone, and topical steroids. In severe cases, immunosuppressive drugs, such as azathioprine or cyclophosphamide, may be necessary.

Pemphigus foliaceus is a rare, autoimmune blistering skin disorder that is characterized by the development of flaccid blisters on the skin. It is most common in adults over the age of 60, and is more common in women than men. The exact cause of pemphigus foliaceus is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder.

The diagnosis of pemphigus foliaceus is made based on the clinical presentation and a skin biopsy. Treatment is typically with oral corticosteroids, such as prednisone, and topical steroids. In severe cases, immunosuppressive drugs, such as azathioprine or cyclophosphamide, may be necessary.

In the case presented, the patient has a 1-month history of crusted lesions with purulent drainage on the scalp, with associated pruritus and pain. He has a distant history of actinic keratoses on the scalp treated with liquid nitrogen but otherwise denied previous skin cancer. Examination of the scalp revealed male pattern baldness, diffuse actinic damage, and multiple thick, yellow-brown crusts overlying erosions with purulent drainage. A wound culture was performed and grew methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. A shave biopsy was obtained.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is folliculitis decalvans. This is supported by the patient's history of actinic keratoses, which are a precancerous skin condition that is often associated with folliculitis decalvans. The patient's clinical presentation, with crusted lesions and purulent drainage, is also consistent with folliculitis decalvans. The biopsy findings, which showed inflammation and necrosis of the hair follicles, are also consistent with folliculitis decalvans.

The other possible diagnoses, squamous cell carcinoma, erosive pustular dermatosis, and pemphigus foliaceus, are less likely in this case. Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that is not typically associated with actinic keratoses. Erosive pustular dermatosis is a rare, inflammatory skin disorder that is not typically associated with hair loss. Pemphigus foliaceus is an autoimmune blistering skin disorder that is not typically associated with hair loss.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis in this case is folliculitis decalvans. This is supported by the patient's history, clinical presentation, and biopsy findings.

Meningitis is an inflammation of the meninges, which are the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. It is usually caused by a viral or bacterial infection, and can cause a variety of symptoms, including fever, headache, stiff neck, and nausea and vomiting. However, meningitis does not typically cause olfactory disorders or delayed puberty.

VACTERL constellation is a group of birth defects that can affect the vertebrae, heart, eyes, trachea, esophagus, kidneys, and limbs. It is not typically associated with olfactory disorders or delayed puberty.

Kallmann syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the hypothalamus, a part of the brain that controls hormone production. People with Kallmann syndrome typically have a decreased sense of smell, delayed puberty, and hypogonadism (low levels of testosterone or estrogen). However, the patient in this case does not have a decreased sense of smell, and her MRI results show that her ovaries are normal.

MRKH syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects the development of the female reproductive system. People with MRKH syndrome are born without a uterus or vagina, and they typically have normal ovaries. They may also have other abnormalities, such as kidney or urinary tract problems. The patient in this case has all of the classic symptoms of MRKH syndrome, including a vaginal defect, uterine rudiments, and normal ovaries.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for the patient in this case is MRKH syndrome.

Erythema annulare centrifugum is a common skin condition characterized by annular (ring-shaped) lesions that often start as small, red bumps and then expand outward. The lesions are usually not painful, but they can be itchy.

Erythema annulare centrifugum is often associated with other medical conditions, such as infections, autoimmune disorders, and allergies. However, it can also occur for no apparent reason.

The treatment for erythema annulare centrifugum depends on the underlying cause. If the condition is caused by an infection, antibiotics may be prescribed. If it is caused by an autoimmune disorder, medications to suppress the immune system may be used. If there is no underlying cause, the condition may go away on its own or with treatment with topical steroids or antihistamines.

The following are the reasons why the other options are incorrect:

* B: Eosinophilic annular erythema is a rare skin condition characterized by annular (ring-shaped) lesions that often contain eosinophils, a type of white blood cell. Eosinophilic annular erythema is not typically associated with systemic immunotherapy.
* C: Granuloma annulare is a chronic skin condition characterized by small, raised bumps that often form rings or arc-shaped lesions. Granuloma annulare is not typically associated with systemic immunotherapy.
* D: Drug-induced bullous pemphigoid is a rare autoimmune blistering disorder that can be caused by certain medications, including systemic immunotherapy. However, the rash in this case does not have the characteristic blisters of drug-induced bullous pemphigoid.

Explanation:
The patient in this case presents with a number of clinical features that are consistent with mantle cell lymphoma (MCL). These include leonine facies, madarosis, lymphadenopathy, and shortness of breath. Histopathologic examination of a skin biopsy shows a dense diffuse dermal lymphoid infiltrate composed of small to medium cells with irregular nuclear contours. Immunohistochemistry shows diffusely positive cyclin D1 staining. Cyclin D1 is a protein that is essential for cell division and is often overexpressed in MCL.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Folliculotropic mycosis fungoides is a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that typically presents with skin lesions on the head and neck. It does not typically cause lymphadenopathy or shortness of breath.
* Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is a type of B-cell lymphoma that typically presents with rapidly enlarging lymph nodes. It does not typically cause leonine facies or madarosis.
* Marginal zone lymphoma is a type of B-cell lymphoma that typically presents with lymphadenopathy and splenomegaly. It does not typically cause leonine facies or madarosis.

The patient has a history of a viral prodrome, palpitations, dizziness, and heart block. The electrocardiogram shows a sinus rhythm with complete heart block and a narrow QRS junctional escape at 65 beats per minute. The patient's erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level are elevated, which suggests an inflammatory process. The transthoracic echocardiogram shows no structural abnormalities, while the fluorine 18–labeledfluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography with computed tomography (FDG-PET–CT) shows a small focal area of FDG uptake in the region of the membranous septum. This suggests that the patient has an inflammatory myocarditis.

The first step in the management of myocarditis is to place a temporary pacemaker to ensure that the patient has adequate cardiac output. Ceftriaxone should be started to treat any possible bacterial infection. Corticosteroids may be used to reduce inflammation, but their efficacy is controversial. A dual-chamber implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) or a dual-chamber permanent pacemaker may be needed in patients with persistent heart block or ventricular arrhythmias.

The other options are incorrect because they do not provide adequate treatment for the patient's condition. Option B, placing a temporary pacemaker and starting corticosteroids, would not provide adequate treatment for the patient's heart block. Option C, placing a dual-chamber implantable cardioverter defibrillator, would be premature in this patient who does not have ventricular arrhythmias. Option D, implanting a dual-chamber permanent pacemaker, would be a permanent solution that is not necessary in this patient who may recover from the myocarditis.

Rett syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder that affects girls almost exclusively. It is characterized by a period of normal development followed by a regression of developmental milestones, including loss of acquired communication, purposeful hand use, and social engagement. Other features of Rett syndrome include repetitive hand movements, seizures, ataxia, and scoliosis.

The diagnosis of Rett syndrome is based on the clinical features, supported by genetic testing. There is no cure for Rett syndrome, but treatment is aimed at managing the symptoms. This may include physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and medication for seizures or spasticity.

The patient in the case presented with microcephaly, short stature, intellectual disability, severe degree of scoliosis, gait abnormality, and encephalopathy. She also experienced a progressive developmental delay such as reduction of head growth, loss of acquired communication, and loss of motor functions between ages 9 and 12 years. These features are consistent with a diagnosis of Rett syndrome.

Turner syndrome is a chromosomal disorder that affects girls. It is characterized by short stature, infertility, and other health problems. Fragile X syndrome is a genetic disorder that can cause intellectual disability, autism, and other problems. Cerebral palsy is a group of neurological disorders that can cause problems with movement, balance, and coordination.

While Turner syndrome, Fragile X syndrome, and cerebral palsy can all cause some of the features seen in the patient, they do not explain the full range of her symptoms. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Rett syndrome.

The patient's history and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of kwashiorkor, a form of protein-energy malnutrition. Kwashiorkor is most common in children aged 6 months to 3 years who have been weaned from breast milk to a diet that is low in protein and calories. The characteristic features of kwashiorkor include edema, dermatitis, hair changes, and growth retardation.

The laboratory findings in kwashiorkor are typically non-specific, but may include low levels of serum albumin, prealbumin, and other nutritional markers. A skin biopsy may be helpful to confirm the diagnosis, but is not necessary in most cases. Treatment of kwashiorkor consists of providing the patient with a diet that is high in protein and calories. This may be accomplished through oral feedings, tube feedings, or parenteral nutrition. In addition, the patient may need to receive treatment for any associated infections.

The other options are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate next steps in the management of this patient. Option B, checking urinalysis and urine microscopy to evaluate for protein in urine, is not necessary in this case because the patient's history and physical examination findings are not consistent with a diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome. Option C, performing a skin biopsy, is not necessary in most cases of kwashiorkor because the diagnosis can be made based on the patient's history and physical examination findings. Option D, treating with topical steroids, is not appropriate because kwashiorkor is a nutritional disorder, not a skin disorder.

The patient's presentation is concerning for disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a life-threatening condition characterized by widespread activation of the coagulation cascade, which can lead to microvascular thrombosis and organ damage. The skin findings are consistent with DIC, as are the laboratory findings of leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, and elevated troponin level. A skin biopsy is the most definitive way to diagnose DIC, as it can show evidence of microvascular thrombosis. Treatment for DIC is supportive and includes reversal of the underlying cause, if possible, and administration of blood products and anticoagulants.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option B: Administer tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) is not the correct treatment for DIC, as tPA is a thrombolytic agent that can worsen the microvascular thrombosis.
* Option C: Starting empirical intravenous antibiotics is not the correct treatment for DIC, as there is no evidence of infection in this patient.
* Option D: Pursuing surgical evaluation is not the correct treatment for DIC, as there is no indication for surgery in this patient.

In conclusion, the correct answer is: A. Perform a skin biopsy.

The clinical presentation of a 14-month-old girl with recurrent left subconjunctival hemorrhage with increasing frequency since 7 months of age, as well as a small intraocular lightly pigmented lesion at the 5-o'clock limbus, is concerning for a possible orbital mass. The presence of a large inferior orbital lesion measuring more than 17 mm in the anterior-to-posterior dimension on B-scan ultrasonography further supports this diagnosis.

In order to confirm the diagnosis and determine the nature of the orbital mass, the next step in management should be to refer the child for a biopsy of the lesion. This will allow for histopathological evaluation of the tissue, which can help to identify the specific type of lesion and determine its underlying cause.

Aspiration of the orbital lesion is not a necessary or appropriate first step in management. This would not provide any diagnostic information and could potentially damage the lesion, making it more difficult to biopsy.

Scheduling an orbital computed tomography scan is also not necessary or appropriate at this stage. This would only provide additional imaging information, which would not be helpful in making a diagnosis or determining the next step in management.

Examining the abdomen during the EUA is not necessary or appropriate at this stage. This would not provide any diagnostic information about the orbital mass.

Therefore, the next step in management should be to refer the child for a biopsy of the lesion.

Explanation:

The patient has a right supraorbital abscess with mass effect resulting in right hypoglobus, multiple communicating channels through inner and outer tables with cortical breakthrough in the frontal sinus, and advanced dental caries that communicated directly with the maxillary sinus owing to cortex erosion. This is a complex case that requires a multidisciplinary approach. The first step is to drain the abscess and remove any necrotic tissue. This can be done through an anterior orbitotomy, which is a surgical incision that allows access to the orbit. Once the abscess is drained, the next step is to address the underlying cause of the infection, which is the frontal sinusitis. This can be done with endoscopic sinus surgery, which is a minimally invasive procedure that allows the surgeon to visualize and treat the sinuses.

Options A and B are incorrect because they do not address the underlying cause of the infection. Option C is incorrect because it does not address the abscess.

I hope this helps! Please let me know if you have any other questions.

The patient's history and examination findings are concerning for a serious underlying condition, such as an intracranial tumor or a vascular malformation. These conditions can cause secondary glaucoma, which is a type of glaucoma that is caused by an increase in intraocular pressure (IOP) due to a blockage of the outflow of aqueous humor from the eye. Secondary glaucoma is a medical emergency and requires prompt treatment to prevent permanent vision loss.

The patient's IOP is elevated, which is a sign of glaucoma. She also has dilated and tortuous bulbar blood vessels, which can be a sign of an intracranial tumor or a vascular malformation. In addition, she has a left-sided nonspecific dull headache, constant for the previous 2 months, and an annoying “whooshing” noise in the patient’s left ear. These symptoms are also concerning for an intracranial tumor or a vascular malformation.

To rule out an intracranial tumor or a vascular malformation, the patient should be referred for urgent neuroimaging. Neuroimaging can help to identify the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and to determine the best course of treatment.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Option A, suggesting supportive strategies (eg, cold compresses, ocular lubricants) and considering increasing the topical corticosteroid treatment or prescribing a topical nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), is not appropriate because the patient's symptoms are concerning for a serious underlying condition. Option B, prescribing an oral NSAID and/or systemic immunosuppression (oral corticosteroid) and performing chest radiography, urinalysis, blood tests, and other studies, is not appropriate because these tests are not necessary to rule out an intracranial tumor or a vascular malformation. Option D, performing a general examination (for a port-wine stain) and dilated ophthalmoscopy, is not appropriate because these tests are not necessary to rule out an intracranial tumor or a vascular malformation.

Explanation: The patient has a left intraconal mass that is isointense relative to rectus muscles on T1-weighted images and hypointense with a hyperintense rim on T2-weighted images. This is a suggestive finding for a rhabdomyosarcoma. Rhabdomyosarcoma is a soft tissue sarcoma that can arise in the orbit. It is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children. The treatment for rhabdomyosarcoma is surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. A biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and to determine the subtype of rhabdomyosarcoma. The subtype of rhabdomyosarcoma will determine the best course of treatment.

A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the orbits is not necessary in this case. The MRI scan has already provided enough information to make a diagnosis. A CT scan may be helpful in cases where the MRI scan is inconclusive.

Observing the patient would not be the best course of action. The patient has a potentially life-threatening condition that requires treatment.

Beginning treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy without a biopsy is not the best course of action. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy can have serious side effects. It is important to know the diagnosis before starting treatment.

Explanation:

The patient is a female smoker in her 50s who was referred for hyperparathyroidism and a multinodular goiter. The patient reported symptoms of joint and musculoskeletal pain and fatigue but denied fever, sore throat, abdominal pain, and kidney stones. Her medical history was remarkable for congestive heart failure and schizophrenia. Neck examination revealed no meaningful findings except right thyroid enlargement. Results of laboratory evaluation demonstrated normal white blood cell count, borderline hypercalcemia (10.6 mg/dL), and elevated parathyroid hormone level (208 pg/mL). She underwent ultrasonography at an outside facility, and results demonstrated a 2.2-cm dominant right thyroid nodule with additional smaller thyroid nodules. Findings of preoperative technetium-99m (Tc-99m) sestamibi planar and single-photon emission computed tomographic/computed tomographic (SPECT/CT) imaging were nonlocalizing for a parathyroid adenoma and showed increased uptake in the dominant right thyroid nodule. Results of an ultrasound-guided biopsy of the thyroid nodule demonstrated a benign colloid nodule with cystic changes. Computed tomography with intravenous contrast was obtained, and findings were initially reported as negative except for right multinodular goiter. However, on additional review, a well-circumscribed fat density mass measuring 3.0 × 2.3 × 1.1-cm was identified in the right retropharyngeal space posterior to the hypopharynx.

The most likely diagnosis is an ectopic parathyroid lipoadenoma. This is a rare condition in which a parathyroid gland is found in an abnormal location, such as the retropharyngeal space. Ectopic parathyroid glands are often associated with hyperparathyroidism, which is a condition in which the parathyroid glands produce too much parathyroid hormone. Hyperparathyroidism can cause symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, bone pain, and kidney stones.

The diagnosis of an ectopic parathyroid lipoadenoma is made based on the patient's history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with hyperparathyroidism. The laboratory tests show elevated levels of parathyroid hormone, which is a characteristic finding of hyperparathyroidism. The imaging studies show a well-circumscribed fat density mass in the right retropharyngeal space. This is a typical finding for an ectopic parathyroid lipoadenoma.

The treatment for an ectopic parathyroid lipoadenoma is surgical removal of the gland. This is usually done through a minimally invasive procedure. The surgery is usually successful in relieving the symptoms of hyperparathyroidism.

The other options are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms and findings. Liposarcoma is a type of cancer that starts in fat cells. It is usually found in the abdomen, but it can also occur in other parts of the body, such as the neck. Liposarcoma would not explain the patient's symptoms of hyperparathyroidism. Ectopic thyroid is a condition in which thyroid tissue is found in an abnormal location, such as the neck. Ectopic thyroid would not explain the patient's elevated levels of parathyroid hormone. Retropharyngeal abscess is a collection of pus in the retropharyngeal space. It is usually caused by an infection of the throat or tonsils. Retropharyngeal abscess would not explain the patient's findings on imaging studies.

Explanation:
The patient is a 19-year-old woman with a 3-month history of right-sided maxillary pain and swelling. The lesion is soft and fluctuant with no appreciable drainage. The patient's history is notable for an 8-year history of right maxillary first premolar impaction. Findings from computed tomography of the head demonstrate a relatively spherical 4-cm growth of the right anterior maxilla abutting the maxillary sinus and orbital floors, and enclosing an impacted premolar at the superior margin of the growth. There was no proptosis or visual field changes associated with the lesion. An incisional biopsy was performed via an intraoral approach, and results demonstrated a thickly encapsulated proliferation of odontogenic epithelial cells with pseudoglandular elements. Following diagnostic confirmation, the patient was taken to the operating room, and a midface (Weber-Ferguson) incision was used to access the maxillary lesion for complete removal.

The most likely diagnosis is an odontogenic keratocyst (OKC). OKCs are the most common type of odontogenic cyst, accounting for approximately 15% of all odontogenic cysts. They are typically seen in young adults, with a mean age of presentation of 20 years. OKCs are most commonly found in the mandible, followed by the maxilla. They are often associated with impacted teeth, as in this case. OKCs are typically asymptomatic, but they can present with pain, swelling, or drainage. On imaging, OKCs appear as well-circumscribed, unilocular radiolucencies. Histologically, OKCs are characterized by a thick, keratinized lining. They can be locally aggressive and have a high rate of recurrence. The treatment of choice for OKCs is surgical excision.

The other possible diagnoses in this case are dentigerous cyst, ameloblastoma, and adenomatoid odontogenic tumor. Dentigerous cysts are the most common type of odontogenic cyst, accounting for approximately 30% of all odontogenic cysts. They are typically seen in young adults, with a mean age of presentation of 20 years. Dentigerous cysts are most commonly found in the maxilla, followed by the mandible. They are often associated with impacted teeth, as in this case. Dentigerous cysts are typically asymptomatic, but they can present with pain, swelling, or drainage. On imaging, dentigerous cysts appear as well-circumscribed, unilocular radiolucencies. Histologically, dentigerous cysts are characterized by a thin, non-keratinized lining. They are benign and have a low rate of recurrence. The treatment of choice for dentigerous cysts is surgical excision.

Ameloblastomas are the second most common type of odontogenic tumor, accounting for approximately 20% of all odontogenic tumors. They are typically seen in adults, with a mean age of presentation of 30 years. Ameloblastomas can occur in any tooth-bearing area, but they are most common in the mandible. They are typically asymptomatic, but they can present with pain, swelling, or drainage. On imaging, ameloblastomas appear as multilocular radiolucencies. Histologically, ameloblastomas are characterized by a proliferation of odontogenic epithelial cells. They are locally aggressive and have a high rate of recurrence. The treatment of choice for ameloblastomas is surgical excision.

Adenomatoid odontogenic tumors are the third most common type of odontogenic tumor, accounting for approximately 10% of all odontogenic tumors. They are typically seen in children and young adults, with a mean age of presentation of 15 years. Adenomatoid odontogenic tumors can occur in any tooth-bearing area, but they are most common in the maxilla. They are typically asymptomatic, but they can present with pain, swelling, or drainage. On imaging, adenomatoid odontogenic tumors appear as well-circumscribed, unilocular radiolucencies. Histologically, adenomatoid odontogenic tumors are characterized by a proliferation of odontogenic epithelial cells and odontogenic ectomesenchyme. They are benign and have a low rate of recurrence. The treatment of choice for adenomatoid odontogenic tumors is surgical excision.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis in this case is an odontogenic keratocyst.

Explanation: The patient's history and physical examination are most consistent with fibroblastic rheumatism. Fibroblastic rheumatism is a rare, chronic, inflammatory disorder characterized by the formation of subcutaneous nodules and progressive fibrosis of the skin and underlying tissues. The disease typically affects middle-aged women, and women with ovarian cancer are at increased risk. The diagnosis is made based on clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging studies. Treatment is aimed at controlling inflammation and preventing fibrosis.

Dupuytren contracture is a common, non-inflammatory disorder of the palmar fascia that results in thickening and contracture of the fingers. The disease typically affects middle-aged men, and is not associated with systemic symptoms. Palmar fasciitis and polyarthritis syndrome is a rare, inflammatory disorder characterized by the formation of nodules on the palms and fingers, and associated arthritis. Scleroderma is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by fibrosis of the skin, lungs, heart, and other organs.

In the case presented, the patient's history and physical examination are most consistent with fibroblastic rheumatism. The patient is a middle-aged woman with a history of rapidly progressive redness and stiffness of both hands, accompanied by 2 months of multiple finger joint and right shoulder pain. The patient's skin biopsy showed increased fibroblasts with fibrosis from dermis to subcutis. The patient's CT scan showed bilateral ovarian tumors with highly suspect peritoneal metastases. These findings are all consistent with fibroblastic rheumatism.

Benign lymphangioendothelioma is a rare, benign vascular tumor that most commonly affects the skin. It is characterized by the proliferation of lymphatic endothelial cells, which form small, thin-walled vessels. The tumor is typically asymptomatic and may be discovered incidentally on physical examination. In some cases, it may cause a reddish-brown or purple discoloration of the skin.

The diagnosis of benign lymphangioendothelioma is made on the basis of a biopsy of the lesion. The biopsy specimen will show a proliferation of lymphatic endothelial cells, which are positive for CD31, CD34, and D2-40. The tumor is negative for HHV-8 (latent nuclear antigen) and Wilms tumor 1 (WT1).

Benign lymphangioendothelioma is a benign condition that does not require treatment. However, if the tumor is cosmetically disfiguring, it may be removed surgically.

The other possible diagnoses are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Kaposi sarcoma is a malignant vascular tumor that is most commonly associated with HIV infection. It is characterized by the proliferation of spindle-shaped cells, which form large, irregular vessels. The tumor is often associated with systemic symptoms, such as fever, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy.
* Hobnail hemangioma is a rare, benign vascular tumor that most commonly affects the skin. It is characterized by the proliferation of hobnail-shaped endothelial cells, which form large, irregular vessels. The tumor is typically asymptomatic and may be discovered incidentally on physical examination. In some cases, it may cause a reddish-brown or purple discoloration of the skin.
* Low-grade angiosarcoma is a rare, malignant vascular tumor that most commonly affects the skin. It is characterized by the proliferation of atypical endothelial cells, which form small, thin-walled vessels. The tumor is often associated with systemic symptoms, such as fever, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy.

Balloon mitral valvuloplasty is a procedure that is used to open a narrowed mitral valve. It is not recommended for pregnant women because it can cause complications in the mother and the baby. Transcatheter MV-in-ring procedure is a newer procedure that is used to repair a mitral valve that is not working properly. It is not yet approved for use in pregnant women. Surgical MV replacement is the most invasive option and is only recommended if medical management fails.

In this case, the patient is a 40-year-old woman with a history of mitral valve endocarditis and mitral regurgitation. She has had multiple surgeries to repair her mitral valve, and she is now pregnant. She has mild exertional dyspnea, a right ventricular heave, and elevated jugular venous pulsation. Transthoracic echocardiogram demonstrated normal biventricular function, mild RV dilation, RV systolic pressure of 84 mm Hg, normal left atrial size, and mean MV gradient of 18 mm Hg at a heart rate of 97 bpm. Transesophageal echocardiogram revealed mean MV gradient of 21 mm Hg at a heart rate of 100 bpm.

The patient strongly desires this pregnancy and declined termination. The goal of management in this case is to optimize the patient's condition and to minimize the risk of complications to the mother and the baby. Medical management with metoprolol and enoxaparin is a reasonable approach. Metoprolol is a beta-blocker that can help to reduce the heart rate and improve cardiac output. Enoxaparin is a low-molecular-weight heparin that can help to prevent blood clots.

If medical management fails, then surgical MV replacement may be necessary. However, this is a major surgery with significant risks for the mother and the baby. It is important to weigh the risks and benefits of all treatment options before making a decision.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disorder characterized by the proliferation of Langerhans cells, which are a type of white blood cell. It most commonly affects children, and can cause a variety of symptoms, including skin lesions, bone lesions, and lymphadenopathy. However, the patient in this case does not have any skin lesions or bone lesions, and her lymphadenopathy is not associated with any other symptoms.

Rosai-Dorfman disease is a rare disorder characterized by the proliferation of dendritic cells, which are a type of white blood cell. It most commonly affects young adults, and can cause a variety of symptoms, including lymphadenopathy, fever, and fatigue. However, the patient in this case does not have any fever or fatigue, and her lymphadenopathy is not associated with any other symptoms.

Neuroblastoma is a rare cancer that affects the adrenal glands, which are located above the kidneys. It most commonly affects children, and can cause a variety of symptoms, including abdominal pain, weight loss, and bone pain. However, the patient in this case does not have any abdominal pain, weight loss, or bone pain.

Lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system, which is a network of organs and tissues that help the body fight infection. There are many different types of lymphoma, and they can vary in terms of their symptoms, severity, and prognosis. The patient in this case has several features that are consistent with lymphoma, including painless neck swelling, fever, and anemia. Additionally, the patient's lymphadenopathy is FDG-avid on PET/CT imaging, which is a characteristic finding in lymphoma. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is lymphoma.

The patient in this case has a history of lung cancer with ROS1 rearrangement. He has been receiving treatment with ceritinib, which has been effective in reducing the size of his tumor and metastatic lesions. However, he has recently developed a new consolidation lesion over the right upper lobe. This lesion could be a sign of disease recurrence, but it is also possible that it is caused by a benign condition, such as granulomatous inflammation.

In order to determine the cause of the new lesion, it is necessary to perform a CT-guided biopsy. This procedure involves inserting a needle through the skin and into the lung to obtain a sample of tissue. The tissue sample can then be examined under a microscope to determine whether it contains cancer cells.

If the biopsy reveals that the lesion is caused by cancer, then the patient's treatment plan will need to be adjusted. However, if the biopsy reveals that the lesion is benign, then the patient can continue with his current treatment plan.

A, B, and C are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate next steps for this patient.

A is incorrect because chemotherapy is not the most appropriate treatment for disease recurrence in this patient. Crizotinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), which is a type of drug that blocks the growth of cancer cells. Chemotherapy is a type of drug that kills cancer cells, but it can also damage healthy cells. In this patient, chemotherapy would be more likely to damage healthy cells than to kill cancer cells.

B is incorrect because antibiotics are not the most appropriate treatment for granulomatous inflammation. Granulomatous inflammation is a type of inflammation that is characterized by the formation of granulomas, which are small collections of immune cells. Antibiotics are not effective against granulomatous inflammation.

C is incorrect because it is premature to discontinue crizotinib and other TKIs permanently. The patient's new lesion could be caused by a benign condition, such as granulomatous inflammation. If the lesion is caused by a benign condition, then the patient can continue with his current treatment plan.

Explanation:
The most likely diagnosis is rhabdomyosarcoma, a soft tissue sarcoma that can arise in any part of the body, but is most common in the head and neck region. Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children, accounting for about 30% of all cases. It is a highly aggressive tumor, with a high rate of metastasis. The classic presentation of rhabdomyosarcoma is a rapidly growing mass, often with associated pain, swelling, and redness. In this case, the patient presents with a right eye and right cheek mass that was noted at birth. The mass has since doubled in size and is associated with exophthalmos, a protrusion of the eye. The patient also has a soft, mobile, right parotid mass. These findings are consistent with rhabdomyosarcoma.

Retinoblastoma is a rare, malignant tumor of the retina that typically presents in early childhood. It is the most common intraocular malignancy in children, and is the most common cause of blindness in children. Retinoblastoma is usually diagnosed before the age of 3 years, and is often bilateral. The classic presentation of retinoblastoma is a white pupillary reflex, which is caused by a tumor in the back of the eye. Other signs and symptoms of retinoblastoma include strabismus (crossed eyes), leukocoria (a white spot in the pupil), and photophobia (sensitivity to light). In this case, the patient does not have any of the classic signs or symptoms of retinoblastoma.

Atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (ATRT) is a rare, highly malignant tumor that can occur in any part of the body, but is most common in the brain and spinal cord. ATRT is the most common malignant brain tumor in infants younger than 1 year old. It is a highly aggressive tumor, with a poor prognosis. The classic presentation of ATRT is a rapidly growing mass, often with associated seizures, headache, and vomiting. In this case, the patient does not have any of the classic signs or symptoms of ATRT.

Medulloepithelioma is a rare, malignant tumor that arises from the ependymal cells that line the ventricles of the brain. Medulloepithelioma is the most common malignant tumor of the brainstem in children. It is a highly aggressive tumor, with a poor prognosis. The classic presentation of medulloepithelioma is a rapidly growing mass, often with associated headache, vomiting, and ataxia. In this case, the patient does not have any of the classic signs or symptoms of medulloepithelioma.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis in this case is rhabdomyosarcoma. The patient's presentation is consistent with rhabdomyosarcoma, and there are no other findings that would suggest a different diagnosis.

Explanation:

The patient has a history of type 2 diabetes, which is a risk factor for hypomagnesemia. In addition, she is taking ranitidine, which can reduce gastrointestinal magnesium absorption. Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's hypomagnesemia is her medication. Stopping ranitidine is the most likely intervention to improve her magnesium levels.

The other options are not as likely to be the cause of the patient's hypomagnesemia. Alcoholism is a risk factor for hypomagnesemia, but the patient does not have a history of alcoholism. Improving glycemic control may help to improve the patient's magnesium levels, but it is not the most likely cause of her hypomagnesemia. Starting insulin is not necessary to treat hypomagnesemia. Insulin does not promote magnesium reabsorption at the proximal convoluted tubule.

The patient has a history of rectal adenocarcinoma, which is a type of cancer that starts in the rectum. The cancer has metastasized to the lungs, which means that it has spread to other parts of the body. The new, 1-cm posterior subglottic lesion is most likely a metastasis from the rectal adenocarcinoma.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely. Tracheal granulomas are usually caused by infection or inflammation, and they are not associated with a history of cancer. Subglottic squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that starts in the squamous cells that line the larynx. It is more common in people who smoke, and it is not associated with a history of cancer in the rectum. Subglottic papilloma is a benign tumor that starts in the papilloma virus. It is not associated with a history of cancer.

The patient's history, physical examination, and imaging studies all support the diagnosis of metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma. The patient should be referred to a cancer specialist for further evaluation and treatment.

The patient is a 27-year-old woman with a history of heroin use who presented with syncope. She denied prodromal symptoms and reported this was her first syncopal episode. She reported a few episodes of dizziness in the couple days prior to presentation but denied chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, or the recent use of illicit drugs or new medications. Shortly after arrival at the emergency department, she had a 50-second run of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Her vital signs and the results of her physical examination were normal. Troponin levels, thyroid levels, and the results of a complete blood cell count and metabolic panel were all normal. The results of imaging studies, including echocardiography, computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiography, and brain CT, were also unremarkable. Coronary angiography found no evidence of obstructive coronary disease. The results of the urine toxicology test were negative. An initial electrocardiogram (ECG) at presentation was reviewed (Figure).

The most likely cause of the patient's syncope is an arrhythmia. The patient's history of heroin use increases her risk of developing an arrhythmia. The patient's ECG showed a prolonged QT interval, which is a risk factor for arrhythmias. The patient's syncope was followed by a run of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, which is a type of arrhythmia that can be life-threatening.

The next step in the patient's management is to perform treadmill stress testing to evaluate for inherited arrhythmias. Treadmill stress testing is a safe and effective way to evaluate for arrhythmias. Treadmill stress testing is especially important in patients who have a history of syncope and a prolonged QT interval.

The other options are not as appropriate for the patient's management. Amiodarone infusion therapy is a treatment for arrhythmias, but it is not the first-line treatment for a patient who has a first-time syncopal episode. Implanting an internal implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is a treatment for patients who are at high risk of sudden cardiac death, but the patient does not meet the criteria for ICD implantation. Sending blood test for drug levels is not necessary in this case, because the patient's history of heroin use is already known.

Therefore, the correct answer is: C. Perform treadmill stress testing for evaluation of inherited arrhythmias.

Carbon monoxide poisoning is a common cause of accidental death in the United States. It is caused by the inhalation of carbon monoxide, a colorless, odorless gas that is produced by the incomplete combustion of carbon-containing materials, such as gasoline, natural gas, propane, wood, and charcoal. Carbon monoxide binds to hemoglobin in the blood, preventing it from carrying oxygen to the tissues. This can lead to a variety of symptoms, including headache, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, confusion, seizures, coma, and death.

The patient in this case presented with several symptoms consistent with carbon monoxide poisoning, including generalized weakness, increased sweating, severe nausea, and vomiting. She also had a history of exposure to carbon monoxide, as she had been in a car that was running in an enclosed space. The electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia and borderline QT interval prolongation, which are also consistent with carbon monoxide poisoning. The computed tomography of the head showed bilateral hyperdensity of the globus pallidi, which is a characteristic finding in carbon monoxide poisoning.

The other options are incorrect. Methanol poisoning can cause similar symptoms, but it is not associated with bilateral hyperdensity of the globus pallidi on computed tomography. Organophosphate poisoning can cause seizures and coma, but it is not associated with generalized weakness, increased sweating, or severe nausea and vomiting. Fahr disease is a rare genetic disorder that causes abnormal deposits of calcium in the basal ganglia, including the globus pallidi. It is not associated with a history of exposure to carbon monoxide.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is carbon monoxide poisoning.

The patient's findings are consistent with longstanding changes caused by a congenital defect. These changes are not likely to be caused by glaucoma, as her intraocular pressure is well-controlled. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not necessary at this time, as it is unlikely to provide any additional information. Trabeculectomy is a surgical procedure that is used to treat glaucoma, but it is not indicated in this case. The patient should be monitored closely with serial examinations and repeated visual field testing to ensure that her condition does not worsen.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each answer choice:

* A. Order magnetic resonance imaging. MRI is a diagnostic test that uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create images of the inside of the body. It can be used to diagnose a variety of conditions, including glaucoma. However, in this case, MRI is not necessary because the patient's findings are consistent with longstanding changes caused by a congenital defect.
* B. Perform trabeculectomy. Trabeculectomy is a surgical procedure that is used to treat glaucoma. It involves creating a drainage channel in the eye to lower intraocular pressure. However, trabeculectomy is not indicated in this case because the patient's intraocular pressure is well-controlled.
* C. Monitor closely with serial examinations and repeated visual field testing. The patient should be monitored closely with serial examinations and repeated visual field testing to ensure that her condition does not worsen. This will allow her doctor to make any necessary changes to her treatment plan.
* D. Reassure the patient that her findings are consistent with longstanding changes caused by a congenital defect. The patient's findings are consistent with longstanding changes caused by a congenital defect. These changes are not likely to be caused by glaucoma, as her intraocular pressure is well-controlled. The patient should be reassured that her condition is not likely to worsen and that she is being closely monitored.

A chondroid syringoma is a benign tumor of the skin that is composed of cells that produce mucin and chondroid material. It is typically located on the face or neck, and it is rarely larger than 1 cm in diameter. Cutaneous meningeal heterotopia is a rare condition in which a piece of meninges (the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord) is present in the skin. It is usually located on the head or neck, and it is often associated with other congenital anomalies. Scalp metastasis is the spread of cancer from another part of the body to the scalp. It is the most common type of metastasis to the scalp, and it is usually caused by breast cancer, lung cancer, or melanoma. Proliferative nodule in a congenital melanocytic nevus is a rare type of nevus (mole) that can develop into a melanoma. It is typically located on the back or buttocks, and it is usually larger than 1 cm in diameter.

In this case, the patient is a woman in her early 70s with a solitary, asymptomatic lump on her scalp. She was born with the lesion but noticed some growth following a minor local trauma a couple of months prior to seeking medical evaluation. The patient denied local inflammation, purulent discharge, and systemic symptoms. Her medical history was unremarkable apart from an allegedly benign breast nodule resection in her teenage years. In addition, her father died of metastatic cutaneous melanoma at 83 years old.

Clinically, there was an ill-defined, infiltrated plaque with a normochromic, exophytic nodule on her scalp vertex measuring 4.2 × 3.8 cm. It had a waxy surface with irregular transverse furrows and overlying alopecia. Dermoscopic evaluation findings revealed a homogeneous yellow hue with no visible vascular or pigmented structures and absence of follicular ostia. The lesion was firm and mildly tender to the touch and seemed adherent to the underlying bone. There were no palpable lymph nodes. A brain magnetic resonance imaging was performed for further elucidation, as well as a punch biopsy.

The brain MRI showed a small, enhancing lesion in the left frontal lobe. The punch biopsy showed a proliferation of monomorphic cells in a syncytial configuration surrounding collagen bundles. This finding is characteristic of a scalp metastasis.

The differential diagnosis of a scalp metastasis includes chondroid syringoma, cutaneous meningeal heterotopia, and proliferative nodule in a congenital melanocytic nevus. However, the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and biopsy results are all consistent with a scalp metastasis.

Therefore, the correct answer is: **C. Scalp metastasis.**

The patient has a 25-year history of bulimia and is purging almost daily. She reported an inability to go more than 3 days at a time without purging and noted a reduction in the pressure and size of her lesions with respite from these daily episodes. This suggests that the lesions are likely related to her bulimia and may improve with treatment of her eating disorder.

Sclerotherapy, surgical excision, and propranolol are all treatments for vascular lesions, but they are not appropriate in this case because the lesions are likely secondary to bulimia. Sclerotherapy and surgical excision are invasive procedures that could potentially worsen the patient's condition, and propranolol is a medication that is used to treat high blood pressure and heart disease. It is not appropriate to use propranolol to treat a patient who does not have these conditions.

The most appropriate course of treatment in this case is to observe the lesions while the patient continues to receive psychiatric treatment for her bulimia. If the lesions do not improve with treatment of her eating disorder, then further treatment options can be considered.

The patient has a diffuse, multinodular tarsal mass with hairpin-shaped vessels. This is highly suggestive of a basal cell carcinoma (BCC), which is the most common type of skin cancer. BCCs are usually slow-growing and rarely metastasize, but they can be locally destructive if not treated. The most common treatment for BCC is surgical excision. In this case, a complete posterior lamellar resection would be the best option. This involves removing the entire thickness of the eyelid, including the tumor, the underlying muscle, and the conjunctiva. The defect is then reconstructed with a skin graft or flap.

Topical interferon alfa-2b, external beam radiotherapy, and intralesional fluorouracil are all treatment options for BCC, but they are not as effective as surgical excision. Topical interferon alfa-2b is a type of immunotherapy that can be used to treat BCCs that are small and superficial. External beam radiotherapy is a type of radiation therapy that can be used to treat BCCs that are larger or more deeply invasive. Intralesional fluorouracil is a type of chemotherapy that can be injected into a BCC to kill the cancer cells. However, none of these treatments are as effective as surgical excision in removing the entire tumor and preventing recurrence.

Therefore, the best treatment for the patient in this case is a complete posterior lamellar resection.

Explanation:

The patient in the case has a recent diagnosis of acute myeloid leukemia (subtype M5a, French-American-British classification) and a 3-week history of a striking pruritic and generalized cutaneous eruption. The eruption is composed of small indurated and edematous papules that confluent to form large urticariform plaques, some with annular configuration. Hyperpigmented patches and focal areas of bruiselike discoloration are seen adjacent to acute lesions. Mucous membranes, palms, and soles are spared. A biopsy specimen shows a superficial and deep dermal perivascular and interstitial mononuclear infiltrate with numerous eosinophils.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of eosinophilic dermatosis of hematologic malignancy. This is a rare disorder that occurs in patients with hematologic malignancies, such as acute myeloid leukemia. The skin lesions are characterized by a pruritic eruption of papules, plaques, and nodules. The lesions are often accompanied by fever, malaise, and weight loss. The diagnosis is made based on the clinical findings and a biopsy that shows a perivascular and interstitial infiltrate of eosinophils.

The treatment for eosinophilic dermatosis of hematologic malignancy is aimed at the underlying hematologic malignancy. In addition, the skin lesions may be treated with topical or systemic corticosteroids. In some cases, immunosuppressive agents, such as azathioprine or cyclosporine, may be necessary.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation.

A. Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) is a rare, serious, multisystem adverse drug reaction characterized by fever, rash, eosinophilia, and organ dysfunction. It is most commonly associated with anticonvulsants, sulfonamides, and antibiotics. The skin lesions in DRESS are typically morbilliform or urticarial. The patient in the case does not have fever, organ dysfunction, or a morbilliform or urticarial rash.

C. Urticarial vasculitis is a rare, chronic inflammatory disorder of the small blood vessels that can affect the skin, joints, and gastrointestinal tract. The skin lesions in urticarial vasculitis are typically wheals that last for more than 24 hours and may be associated with purpura, petechiae, and livedo reticularis. The patient in the case does not have wheals that last for more than 24 hours or purpura, petechiae, or livedo reticularis.

D. Urticarial bullous pemphigoid is a rare, autoimmune blistering disorder that affects the skin and mucous membranes. The skin lesions in urticaria bullous pemphigoid are typically tense blisters that arise on normal-appearing skin. The patient in the case does not have tense blisters.

The patient has a history of living in Guatemala, where cysticercosis is endemic. She presents with headache, photophobia, vomiting, and confusion, which are all common symptoms of cysticercosis. The computed tomography (CT) scan of her brain shows diffuse ventriculomegaly and sulcal effacement, which are consistent with hydrocephalus and cerebral edema. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of her brain shows a 0.4 × 0.4 × 0.6–cm nonenhancing lesion obstructing the aqueduct of Sylvius, which is the classic appearance of a cysticercosis cyst. The sudden decrease in intracranial pressure and rate of CSF drainage from the ventriculostomy on hospital day 5 is a sign that the cyst has ruptured and released its contents into the cerebrospinal fluid. This can cause a severe inflammatory reaction, which can lead to death.

The treatment for cysticercosis is anthelminthic therapy with adjuvant steroids. The most commonly used anthelminthic is albendazole. The steroids are used to reduce the inflammation caused by the rupture of the cyst.

The other options are incorrect because they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Option A, observing the patient without intervention, would allow the cyst to continue to grow and cause more damage. Option C, extracting the lesion surgically, would be risky and may not be successful. Option D, diverting cerebrospinal fluid via ventriculoperitoneal shunt, would not treat the underlying infection.

The patient's history and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of **iron deficiency anemia**. The most common cause of iron deficiency anemia is chronic blood loss, which can occur from a variety of sources, including gastrointestinal bleeding, menstrual bleeding, and pregnancy. Other causes of iron deficiency anemia include decreased iron intake, impaired iron absorption, and increased iron requirements.

The laboratory findings in iron deficiency anemia typically include a low hemoglobin level, a low hematocrit, a low mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and a low mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH). The serum ferritin level is a sensitive and specific test for iron deficiency. The serum iron level is also low in iron deficiency, but it can be normal in early iron deficiency anemia. The serum total iron-binding capacity (TIBC) is elevated in iron deficiency anemia.

The treatment of iron deficiency anemia is to replace the lost iron. This can be done with oral iron supplements or with intravenous iron. The goal of treatment is to increase the hemoglobin level and hematocrit to normal and to replenish the body's iron stores.

The other options are incorrect because they would not be the most helpful in making a diagnosis of iron deficiency anemia. A chest radiograph would not be helpful because the patient's history and physical examination findings are not suggestive of any cardiopulmonary disease. Radiographs of the hands and feet would not be helpful because they would not show any evidence of iron deficiency anemia. A thoracic CT scan would not be helpful because it would not show any evidence of iron deficiency anemia.

Therefore, the correct answer is: **D. Order measurement of serum ferritin level, serum iron level, and serum total iron-binding capacity.**

Explanation:

The patient is a 72-year-old man with recently diagnosed metastatic appendiceal adenocarcinoma undergoing chemotherapy with capecitabine plus oxaliplatin. He presents with lower abdominal pain and watery, large-volume diarrhea up to 15 times per day for the previous 3 weeks. His diarrhea is nonbloody, wakes him up from sleep, is accompanied by crampy abdominal pain, and is not associated with nausea or vomiting. The diarrhea persisted despite treatment with combinations of loperamide, atropine/diphenoxylate, colestipol, and tincture of opium. He required repeated intravenous infusions for fluid and electrolyte repletion.

His physical examination results revealed normal vital signs and a mildly tender abdomen with hyperactive bowel sounds, but no peritoneal signs. His laboratory workup results were notable for severe hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, as well as positive fecal lactoferrin and elevated fecal calprotectin levels of 646 μg/g. His infectious workup results were unremarkable. A computed tomography scan of the abdomen/pelvis revealed diffuse long-segment wall thickening involving nearly the entire terminal ileum. An ileocolonoscopy revealed erythematous and congested mucosa with scattered erosions and ulcerations throughout the examined terminal ileum. Targeted biopsies were obtained.

The histopathology of the biopsy specimens showed adenocarcinoma with features consistent with metastasis from the patient's appendiceal adenocarcinoma.

The diagnosis of ileal metastasis is supported by the patient's history of metastatic appendiceal adenocarcinoma, his clinical presentation of watery diarrhea, and the histopathology of the biopsy specimens. The other possible diagnoses, cytomegalovirus ileitis, capecitabine-induced terminal ileitis, and small bowel carcinoid tumor, are less likely in this patient.

Cytomegalovirus ileitis is a rare complication of cytomegalovirus infection that typically occurs in immunocompromised patients. The patient in this case is not immunocompromised, and his diarrhea is not consistent with cytomegalovirus ileitis.

Capecitabine-induced terminal ileitis is a rare side effect of capecitabine, a chemotherapy drug used to treat gastrointestinal cancers. The patient in this case is receiving capecitabine, but his diarrhea is not consistent with capecitabine-induced terminal ileitis.

Small bowel carcinoid tumor is a rare type of cancer that can occur in the small intestine. The patient in this case does not have any symptoms or findings consistent with small bowel carcinoid tumor.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is ileal metastasis from his appendiceal adenocarcinoma.

 21%|██        | 316/1525 [1:13:21<4:50:07, 14.40s/it]The correct answer is: A. Refer to a retina specialist owing to retinal thinning.

The patient has a history of chronic angle-closure glaucoma and bilateral peripheral iridotomies. She is currently being treated for glaucoma, but her vision in her left eye has been worsening for 2 months. On examination, she has a cup-disc ratio that is enlarged in her left eye, and her optic nerve is pale. These findings are consistent with glaucomatous optic neuropathy.

Glaucoma is a disease that damages the optic nerve, which carries visual information from the eye to the brain. This damage can lead to progressive vision loss, which can eventually result in blindness.

There are several different types of glaucoma, but the most common is primary open-angle glaucoma. This type of glaucoma occurs when the fluid pressure inside the eye builds up, damaging the optic nerve.

The goal of treatment for glaucoma is to lower the pressure inside the eye and prevent further damage to the optic nerve. This can be done with medications, surgery, or a combination of both.

In this case, the patient's vision is worsening despite being treated for glaucoma. This suggests that the glaucoma is not being adequately controlled with her current medications. Therefore, the next step in her care is to refer her to a retina specialist.

A retina specialist is a doctor who specializes in the treatment of diseases of the retina. The retina is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. It converts light into electrical signals that are sent to the brain, which interprets these signals as images.

A retina specialist will be able to examine the patient's eyes more closely and determine the cause of her vision loss. They may also recommend additional tests, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) or visual field testing.

OCT is a non-invasive test that uses light waves to create a detailed image of the retina. Visual field testing is a test that measures the patient's peripheral vision.

Once the retina specialist has determined the cause of the patient's vision loss, they will be able to recommend the best course of treatment. This may include changes to her glaucoma medications, surgery, or other treatments.

The other options are incorrect because they are not the best next steps in the management of this patient's condition.

Option B is to start intraocular pressure–lowering medications owing to GCL loss. While this is an appropriate treatment for glaucoma, it is not the best next step in this patient's care because her vision is already worsening despite being treated with these medications.

Option C is to order a carotid doppler. A carotid doppler is a test that is used to assess blood flow in the carotid arteries, which are the arteries that supply blood to the brain. This test is not indicated in this patient because she does not have any symptoms of a stroke or other cerebrovascular disease.

Option D is to order brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A brain MRI is a test that is used to assess the structure of the brain. This test is not indicated in this patient because she does not have any symptoms of a brain tumor or other neurological condition.

The patient has scleritis and a retinal detachment, which are both serious complications of thyroid eye disease. Scleritis is inflammation of the sclera, the white of the eye. It can cause severe pain, redness, and decreased visual acuity. Retinal detachment is a separation of the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye, from the underlying choroid. It can cause sudden and permanent vision loss.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with scleritis and retinal detachment. The slitlamp examination revealed marked inferior redness, including large-caliber episcleral vessels and scleral thinning that was greatest inferonasally. There was an epithelial defect overlying the thinned sclera, scleral tenderness to palpation, 16 to 25 cells per high-power field in the anterior chamber, and iris neovascularization. The view to the posterior pole was hazy, and B-scan ultrasonography revealed an inferior retinal detachment.

The patient's medical history is also significant for hyperthyroidism, coronary artery disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus. These conditions increase the risk of complications from scleritis and retinal detachment.

The patient's treatment should be aimed at controlling the inflammation and preventing further damage to the eye. High-dose systemic steroids are the mainstay of treatment for scleritis. They can be given intravenously or orally. Topical steroids may also be used to help reduce inflammation in the eye. A rheumatology consult is also indicated to evaluate the patient for underlying autoimmune conditions that may be contributing to his scleritis.

The other options are incorrect because they do not provide adequate treatment for the patient's condition. Option A (giving fortified antibiotics) would not be effective in treating scleritis. Option B (giving topical steroids and cycloplegia) would only provide symptomatic relief and would not address the underlying inflammation. Option C (providing systemic corticosteroids and outpatient follow-up) would not be adequate treatment for a patient with a retinal detachment.

Explanation:

The patient in the case presented with a radiolucent lesion in the anterior mandible with an unerupted mandibular canine at the center of the lesion. The lesion was centered in the cortical bone and extended into the surrounding mucosa, fibroadipose tissue, and skeletal muscle. Perineural invasion was identified, and lymphovascular invasion was absent. The tumor involved multiple margins. Immunohistochemistry findings revealed the tumor cells were positive for p40. Fluorescence in situ hybridization studies demonstrated an EWSR1 gene rearrangement in 60% of the tumor cells.

Odontogenic keratocyst, ameloblastoma, and salivary clear cell carcinoma are all benign odontogenic tumors. Clear cell odontogenic carcinoma is a rare, aggressive malignant odontogenic tumor. The presence of perineural invasion and lymphovascular invasion, as well as the EWSR1 gene rearrangement, are all features that are more consistent with a diagnosis of clear cell odontogenic carcinoma than with the other three tumors.

In addition, clear cell odontogenic carcinoma is the only one of the four tumors that is known to be associated with an EWSR1 gene rearrangement. The EWSR1 gene is a transcription factor that is involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. When it is rearranged, it can lead to the production of a fusion protein that is associated with the development of cancer.

The diagnosis of clear cell odontogenic carcinoma is made based on a combination of clinical, radiographic, and histological findings. The treatment of clear cell odontogenic carcinoma typically involves surgery, with or without radiation therapy. The prognosis for patients with clear cell odontogenic carcinoma is poor, with a high rate of recurrence and metastasis.

Explanation:

Pigmented extramammary Paget disease (PEMP) is a rare, intraepidermal adenocarcinoma of the apocrine glands. It is most commonly seen in women over the age of 60, and it usually presents as a slowly growing, pigmented plaque on the skin of the anogenital area, axilla, or groin.

The diagnosis of PEMP is made on the basis of histopathologic findings, which show the presence of pagetoid cells in the epidermis. Pagetoid cells are atypical melanocytes that have migrated from the dermis into the epidermis. They are characterized by round, pale, vacuolated cytoplasm and large, pleomorphic nuclei.

PEMP is a locally aggressive disease, and it can metastasize to the lymph nodes and other organs. The treatment of PEMP is surgical excision, with or without radiation therapy.

The other options are incorrect because they do not describe the clinical presentation and histopathologic findings of PEMP.

A. Pagetoid Bowen disease is a type of squamous cell carcinoma in situ. It is characterized by the presence of pagetoid cells in the epidermis. However, unlike PEMP, pagetoid Bowen disease does not usually present with a pigmented plaque.

B. Inverse lichen planus is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease that is characterized by flat-topped, violaceous papules. It is most commonly seen in the groin and axillary areas.

D. Superficial spreading melanoma is the most common type of melanoma. It is characterized by a pigmented macule or papule that has irregular borders and a variegated color.

Explanation:

The most likely diagnosis in this case is subcutaneous dirofilariasis. This is a parasitic infection caused by the nematode Dirofilaria immitis. The parasite is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes that bite infected dogs or cats. The larvae migrate through the bloodstream and can lodge in any part of the body, but are most commonly found in the subcutaneous tissues, eyes, and heart.

The clinical presentation of subcutaneous dirofilariasis is variable and depends on the location of the parasite. In the case of subcutaneous nodules, the patient typically presents with a painless, firm, mobile nodule that is usually less than 1 cm in diameter. The nodule may be skin-colored or slightly erythematous. There may be associated lymphadenopathy.

The diagnosis of subcutaneous dirofilariasis is made by histopathologic examination of a biopsy specimen from the nodule. The characteristic finding is the presence of a nematode larva with a thick cuticle, well-developed inner muscular layer, and tubular structures containing microfilariae.

There is no specific treatment for subcutaneous dirofilariasis. The nodules may resolve spontaneously or may be treated with surgical excision. In some cases, treatment with antiparasitic drugs may be necessary.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Onchocercoma is a parasitic infection caused by the nematode Onchocerca volvulus. The parasite is transmitted to humans by black flies. The clinical presentation of onchocercoma includes skin lesions, eye lesions, and lymphadenopathy.
* Cutaneous loiasis is a parasitic infection caused by the nematode Loa loa. The parasite is transmitted to humans by deerflies. The clinical presentation of cutaneous loiasis includes subcutaneous nodules, pruritus, and eye lesions.
* Subcutaneous hydatid cyst is a parasitic infection caused by the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus. The parasite is transmitted to humans by dogs and cats. The clinical presentation of subcutaneous hydatid cyst includes a painless, firm, mobile nodule that may be associated with fever, malaise, and weight loss.

Explanation: Relapsing polychondritis is a rare autoimmune disease that affects the cartilage in the body. It can cause inflammation and destruction of the cartilage in the ears, nose, larynx, trachea, joints, eyes, and heart.

The patient in the case presented with a recurrent sore throat, hoarseness of voice, and swelling and redness of his left ear. He also had a saddle-shaped deformity on his nose and difficulty breathing when he laid supine. These symptoms are consistent with relapsing polychondritis.

The laboratory test results showed elevated C-reactive protein levels, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and a microcytic hypochromic anemia. These findings are also consistent with relapsing polychondritis.

The results for antinuclear antibody, anti–double-stranded DNA, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies were negative. This suggests that the patient does not have any of the other autoimmune diseases that were listed in the question.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for the patient is relapsing polychondritis.

 21%|██        | 322/1525 [1:14:49<4:47:29, 14.34s/it]The correct answer is: **C: Order hemoglobin electrophoresis.**

The patient's presentation is consistent with sickle cell retinopathy, a condition that is caused by sickle cell disease. Sickle cell disease is a genetic disorder that affects the hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. In people with sickle cell disease, the hemoglobin molecules can form long, rigid rods that can distort the shape of the red blood cells. These distorted red blood cells can block blood vessels, leading to ischemia and necrosis of the tissues they supply.

The patient's history of new floaters in her right eye, as well as the findings on her ophthalmoscopy and widefield fluorescein angiography, are all consistent with sickle cell retinopathy. The vitreous hemorrhage in the right eye is likely due to a rupture of a neovascularization, which is a new blood vessel that grows in response to ischemia. The salmon-patch intraretinal hemorrhages in the temporal peripheral retina of both eyes are also consistent with sickle cell retinopathy.

Hemoglobin electrophoresis is a test that can be used to diagnose sickle cell disease. The test involves separating the different types of hemoglobin in the blood by electrophoresis. In people with sickle cell disease, the hemoglobin S will be present in higher levels than normal.

Treatment for sickle cell retinopathy is aimed at preventing further damage to the retina. This may include laser photocoagulation, which is a procedure that uses laser light to destroy abnormal blood vessels in the retina. In some cases, a vitreous hemorrhage may require surgery to remove the blood from the eye.

Intravitreal corticosteroids are not a recommended treatment for sickle cell retinopathy. Corticosteroids can increase the risk of retinal detachment, which is a serious complication of sickle cell retinopathy.

A skin biopsy is not a recommended test for sickle cell retinopathy. A skin biopsy can be used to diagnose pseudoxanthoma elasticum, a condition that can cause neovascularization of the retina. However, the patient's presentation is not consistent with pseudoxanthoma elasticum.

An exchange transfusion is not a recommended treatment for sickle cell retinopathy. Exchange transfusion is a procedure that involves removing some of the patient's blood and replacing it with blood that does not contain sickle hemoglobin. Exchange transfusion is used to treat life-threatening complications of sickle cell disease, such as stroke and acute chest syndrome.

Therefore, the correct answer is: **C: Order hemoglobin electrophoresis.**

Explanation:

The patient is a 9-year-old boy with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and β-thalassemia trait who presented with 1 month of progressive dyspnea, snoring, dysphagia, and weight loss. Both parents had a history of latent tuberculosis infection treated after immigrating to the US from Syria shortly after the patient’s birth. The patient’s pediatrician diagnosed him with reactive airway disease and adenotonsillar hypertrophy. He was referred to the otolaryngology clinic, where flexible laryngoscopy revealed diffuse upper airway lymphoid hyperplasia and supraglottic edema. He was sent to the emergency department, where he was stridulous and afebrile with a normal white blood cell count and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. A computed tomography scan of the neck revealed diffuse edema and contrast enhancement of the nasopharynx, oropharynx, hypopharynx, and supraglottis. A chest radiograph was normal.

The patient was taken urgently to the operating room for direct microlaryngoscopy and intubated. Results of biopsies and cultures of the tonsils, adenoids, and supraglottis revealed diffuse non-necrotizing granulomas and oropharyngeal flora with negative acid-fast bacilli and Grocott methenamine silver stains. He remained intubated, and treatment with systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics was initiated. During this time, he had a normal angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level and normal titers for antinuclear antibody (ANA), cytoplasmic antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody, perinuclear antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibody, antimyeloperoxidase antibody, antiproteinase 3 antibody, anti–double-stranded DNA antibody, Smith antibody, Sjogren antibodies, and histoplasma antibodies. He also had normal results on tuberculin purified protein derivative and interferon-γ release assay (QuantiFERON; Qiagen).

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder of unknown etiology. It can affect any organ system, but the lungs are most commonly involved. The diagnosis of sarcoidosis is made by biopsy of affected tissue, which shows non-necrotizing granulomas. There is no specific treatment for sarcoidosis, but the disease often resolves spontaneously. In patients with severe disease, corticosteroids may be used.

The other possible diagnoses in this patient are tuberculosis, epiglottitis, and granulomatosis with polyangiitis. However, the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are more consistent with sarcoidosis.

Tuberculosis is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is most commonly spread through the air when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. The most common symptoms of tuberculosis are fever, cough, night sweats, and weight loss. The diagnosis of tuberculosis is made by sputum culture. Treatment for tuberculosis includes a combination of antibiotics.

Epiglottitis is a bacterial infection of the epiglottis, the flap of tissue that covers the windpipe. It is most commonly seen in children under the age of 3. The most common symptoms of epiglottitis are fever, sore throat, drooling, and stridor. The diagnosis of epiglottitis is made by clinical examination. Treatment for epiglottitis is immediate intubation and antibiotics.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a systemic vasculitis that affects small and medium-sized blood vessels. It can affect any organ system, but the lungs, kidneys, and heart are most commonly involved. The most common symptoms of GPA are fever, cough, shortness of breath, and weight loss. The diagnosis of GPA is made by biopsy of affected tissue, which shows granulomatous inflammation. Treatment for GPA includes a combination of corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs.

 21%|██        | 324/1525 [1:15:18<4:54:14, 14.70s/it]The answer is: D. Continue to monitor clinically with serial examinations.

The patient is a 4-year-old girl with an asymptomatic, unilateral retinal mass. The mass is white, has no visible calcification or subretinal fluid, and is associated with retinal pigment epithelium changes at the edge of the lesion. The left posterior segment is normal.

The differential diagnosis for a retinal mass includes retinoblastoma, astrocytic hamartoma, and retinal astrocytoma. Retinoblastoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in children, and it is usually diagnosed before the age of 5 years. Astrocytic hamartoma is a benign tumor that is often associated with neurofibromatosis type 1. Retinal astrocytoma is a rare, malignant tumor that is usually diagnosed in adults.

The patient's medical history and physical examination are not suggestive of any of the conditions in the differential diagnosis. The patient is asymptomatic, and there is no evidence of inflammation or other signs of systemic disease. The retinal mass is small and white, which is more characteristic of retinoblastoma than of astrocytic hamartoma or retinal astrocytoma.

The next step in the management of this patient is to continue to monitor clinically with serial examinations. The patient should be seen by an ophthalmologist every 3-6 months to assess the growth of the retinal mass. If the mass grows or if the patient develops any new symptoms, further diagnostic testing, such as ultrasonography, MRI, or biopsy, may be necessary.

The other options are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate next steps in the management of this patient. Option A, initiating a uveitis workup for infectious and inflammatory conditions, is not necessary because the patient is asymptomatic and there is no evidence of inflammation. Option B, planning an urgent examination under anesthesia, ultrasonography, and MRI, is not necessary because the patient is asymptomatic and the retinal mass is small. Option C, obtaining chest and abdomen MRI to evaluate for cardiac rhabdomyoma and kidney cysts or tumors associated with neurocutaneous syndromes, is not necessary because the patient has no clinical symptoms or signs suggestive of these conditions.

 21%|██▏       | 325/1525 [1:15:35<5:05:16, 15.26s/it]The correct answer is A. Perform positron emission tomography–computed tomography to rule out tumor metastasis.

The patient in this case has a mobile intracardiac mass, which is a rare and potentially life-threatening condition. The most common cause of a mobile intracardiac mass is a thrombus, which is a blood clot that forms in the heart. Other possible causes include tumors, parasites, and foreign bodies.

The patient's history and physical examination are not specific for any particular cause of the mass. The laboratory studies are normal, which suggests that the mass is not infected. The abdominal ultrasonography is also normal, which suggests that the mass is not of abdominal origin.

The transthoracic echocardiogram shows a mobile mass located on the tricuspid valve. This is the most common location for a mobile intracardiac mass. The mass is associated with moderate tricuspid regurgitation, which is a backflow of blood from the right ventricle to the right atrium.

The next step in the management of this patient is to perform a positron emission tomography–computed tomography (PET-CT) scan. This test is used to detect tumors and other abnormalities in the body. The PET-CT scan will help to determine the cause of the mass and to assess the extent of the disease.

If the PET-CT scan shows that the mass is a tumor, then the patient will need to undergo further testing to determine the type of tumor and the best treatment options. If the mass is not a tumor, then the patient may need to undergo surgery to remove the mass.

The other possible answers are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Answer B: Perform resection surgery as soon as possible is incorrect because the patient's condition is not yet stable enough for surgery. The PET-CT scan will help to determine the best time for surgery.
* Answer C: Perform blood cultures and provide antibiotic therapy is incorrect because the patient's blood cultures are normal, which suggests that the mass is not infected.
* Answer D: Provide anticoagulation therapy only is incorrect because the mass is associated with moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Anticoagulation therapy may help to prevent blood clots from forming on the mass, but it will not treat the underlying cause of the mass.

The patient is presenting with a severe cutaneous adverse reaction (SCAR) to pembrolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor. SCARs are a rare but serious side effect of PD-1 inhibitors that can be life-threatening. The patient's presentation is consistent with a TEN-like reaction, which is a severe form of SCAR. TEN-like reactions are characterized by widespread blistering, erosions, and desquamation of the skin. They can also involve the mucous membranes, eyes, and gastrointestinal tract.

The patient's condition is likely to progress rapidly and require hospitalization. She should be given intravenous fluids and wound care to prevent dehydration and infection. She may also need to be treated with systemic corticosteroids to suppress her immune system.

Starting a different PD-1 inhibitor is not an option at this time. The patient has already developed a severe reaction to one PD-1 inhibitor, and there is a high risk that she would also develop a reaction to another PD-1 inhibitor.

Discharging the patient with topical triamcinolone 0.5% cream is not an option at this time. Topical steroids are not effective in treating SCARs. The patient's condition is likely to progress rapidly and require hospitalization.

Repeating a punch biopsy is not necessary at this time. The patient's diagnosis is already clear. The biopsy results would not change the management of her condition.

In conclusion, the correct answer is: **B. Provide intravenous fluids and wound care in a burn unit.**

The patient's coronary CT angiography showed no stenosis or plaque. This means that she does not have coronary artery disease (CAD). The negative predictive value of coronary CT angiography is high, meaning that a negative result is very accurate in ruling out CAD. Therefore, no further testing is necessary in this patient.

The other answers are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Answer A: Recommend a follow-up CT and perfusion imaging. This is incorrect because the patient's coronary CT angiography already showed no stenosis or plaque. There is no need to repeat the test.
* Answer B: Recommend further functional testing. This is incorrect because the patient's coronary CT angiography already showed no stenosis or plaque. Functional testing is not necessary to rule out CAD in this patient.
* Answer D: Recommend invasive coronary angiography. This is incorrect because the patient's coronary CT angiography already showed no stenosis or plaque. Invasive coronary angiography is not necessary to rule out CAD in this patient.

The patient presented with a 3-month history of articular heat, pain, redness, and swelling of the fourth finger of his right hand, which subsequently spread to the left hallux and ankle. He also developed a fever. Despite many medical consultations and various attempts at treatment with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, the patient developed widespread arthritis within the following month, which was predominant in the knee, shoulder, and hip. In the month before presentation, the articular symptoms worsened, the joints had become tender, and ill-defined skin nodules had appeared predominantly on the legs. An acute abdominal pain in the left hypochondrium developed, accompanied by nausea and vomiting, which led to a diagnosis of pancreatitis. The patient was admitted to the hospital and clinical measures relieved the pain. Laboratory test results revealed strikingly high levels of lipase and amylase, as well as normal levels of cancer antigen 19-9. Bone computed tomography (CT) of the right shoulder and knee demonstrated cortical bone destruction and intraosseous medullary necrosis. An abdominal CT was performed, and the patient underwent surgery.

The patient's presentation is consistent with PPP syndrome, a rare disorder characterized by pancreatitis, panniculitis, and polyarthritis. PPP syndrome is typically associated with underlying malignancy, most commonly pancreatic cancer. The diagnosis of PPP syndrome is based on clinical and laboratory findings, including a history of pancreatitis, panniculitis, and polyarthritis; elevated serum levels of lipase and amylase; and normal levels of cancer antigen 19-9. Bone CT may demonstrate cortical bone destruction and intraosseous medullary necrosis. The treatment of PPP syndrome is directed at the underlying malignancy. In addition, supportive measures, such as pain management and nutritional support, may be necessary.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not account for the patient's entire presentation. Cancer-associated systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organ systems, including the skin, joints, kidneys, and heart. SLE is not typically associated with pancreatitis, panniculitis, or polyarthritis. Dermatomyositis is an autoimmune disease that primarily affects the skin and muscles. Dermatomyositis is not typically associated with pancreatitis, panniculitis, or polyarthritis. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is a type of vasculitis that can affect small blood vessels throughout the body. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is not typically associated with pancreatitis, panniculitis, or polyarthritis.

The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with B-cell lymphoma, a type of cancer that affects white blood cells. The elevated cerebrospinal fluid white blood cell count and lymphocytosis with predominantly atypical lymphocytes are suggestive of a lymphocytic meningeal infiltration. The IgM level of 5850 mg/dL is also elevated, which is a common finding in B-cell lymphoma.

Plasmapheresis is a procedure that removes plasma from the blood and replaces it with fresh frozen plasma or albumin. This procedure can be used to remove abnormal proteins from the blood, such as the monoclonal antibodies that are produced by B-cell lymphoma cells. Plasmapheresis can also help to reduce the inflammation and swelling that can occur in B-cell lymphoma.

In consultation with oncology, the patient should be started on a course of chemotherapy to treat the B-cell lymphoma. Chemotherapy is a type of cancer treatment that uses drugs to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy can be given in a variety of ways, including intravenous infusions, oral pills, and topical creams.

The patient should also be monitored closely for signs of complications, such as infection, bleeding, and kidney damage. The patient should also be advised to avoid contact with people who are sick and to get plenty of rest.

The other options are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate treatment for B-cell lymphoma. Intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a treatment that is used to treat retinal diseases, such as wet age-related macular degeneration. Start empirical broad-spectrum antibiotics and antivirals is a treatment that is used to treat infections. Initiate a hypercoagulability workup is a test that is used to check for blood clotting disorders.

Explanation:

A Tornwaldt cyst is a rare congenital anomaly that is thought to arise from remnants of the notochord. It is most commonly located in the posterior pharyngeal wall at the level of the second cervical vertebra. The cyst may be asymptomatic or may present with symptoms such as neck pain, dysphagia, and globus sensation. Diagnosis is made with imaging studies such as CT or MRI. Treatment is typically surgical excision.

The other options are incorrect because they are not typically located in the posterior pharyngeal wall. A juxtafacet cyst is a type of synovial cyst that is located near a facet joint. A mucus retention cyst is a type of cyst that is caused by obstruction of a mucus gland. A spinal bronchogenic cyst is a type of cyst that is caused by abnormal development of the lung tissue.

Explanation:
The patient has a history of nontraumatic transient vision loss and has been diagnosed with multifocal ectatic vascular channels of the iris (MEVC). MEVC is a rare, benign condition that is characterized by the presence of abnormal blood vessels on the iris. The exact cause of MEVC is unknown, but it is thought to be a result of microvascular changes that occur with aging. MEVC is typically asymptomatic, but some patients may experience episodes of transient vision loss. These episodes are thought to be caused by occlusion of the abnormal blood vessels, which results in a temporary decrease in blood flow to the retina.

The management of MEVC is generally conservative. Patients with asymptomatic MEVC do not require treatment. However, patients with symptomatic MEVC may be treated with laser photocoagulation to obliterate the abnormal blood vessels. Laser photocoagulation is a safe and effective treatment that can prevent further episodes of transient vision loss.

In the case of the patient described in the question, the best course of action is to photocoagulate the lesions with argon laser at slitlamp evaluation. This will prevent further episodes of transient vision loss and preserve the patient's vision. The other options are not appropriate in this case. Option A (observe until repeated incident) is not appropriate because the patient has already experienced episodes of transient vision loss. Option C (administer intravitreal bevacizumab injections) is not appropriate because bevacizumab is a medication that is used to treat wet age-related macular degeneration, not MEVC. Option D (perform iridocyclectomy to excise the lesions) is not appropriate because iridocyclectomy is a surgical procedure that is used to treat more serious conditions, such as glaucoma.

Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA) is a rare, systemic vasculitis characterized by the presence of eosinophils in the blood and tissues. It is typically associated with asthma, sinusitis, and granulomatous inflammation of the upper airways. EGPA is not a good match for this patient's presentation, as she does not have any of the typical systemic symptoms of EGPA, such as asthma, sinusitis, or granulomatous inflammation of the upper airways.

Eosinophilic angiocentric fibrosis (EAF) is a rare, idiopathic inflammatory disorder characterized by the presence of eosinophils and fibrosis in the perivascular and perineural tissues. It is typically associated with sinonasal disease, but can also involve other organs, such as the lungs, skin, and kidneys. EAF is not a good match for this patient's presentation, as she does not have any of the typical systemic symptoms of EAF, such as sinonasal disease.

Chronic lymphoplasmacytic rhinosinusitis (CLRS) is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the nasal and sinus mucosa characterized by the presence of lymphocytes and plasma cells. It is typically associated with nasal obstruction, discharge, and hyposmia. CLRS is not a good match for this patient's presentation, as she does not have any of the typical symptoms of CLRS, such as nasal obstruction, discharge, and hyposmia.

IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) is a systemic disorder characterized by the infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells and other inflammatory cells into various tissues. It can involve a wide range of organs, including the sinonasal tract, lungs, kidneys, pancreas, and orbit. IgG4-RD is a good match for this patient's presentation, as she has several of the typical symptoms of IgG4-RD, such as progressive bilateral nasal airway obstruction, crusting, and saddle nose deformity. Additionally, her immune workup showed elevated complement C3 and total hemolytic complement levels, which are consistent with IgG4-RD. Finally, the surgical pathology examination demonstrated prominent lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate, angiocentric fibrosis with a relative lack of eosinophils, and increased IgG4 absolute count, all of which are characteristic findings of IgG4-RD.

The patient in this case has a clinical presentation consistent with giant cell myocarditis, a rare but potentially life-threatening inflammatory condition of the heart muscle. The diagnosis is supported by the patient's history of discoid lupus, which is a risk factor for giant cell myocarditis, as well as the patient's laboratory findings, which show elevated levels of eosinophils and inflammatory markers.

The treatment of giant cell myocarditis is generally supportive and includes high-dose steroids, colchicine, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). These medications can help to reduce inflammation and prevent further damage to the heart muscle. In some cases, a patient may also need to be hospitalized for further treatment or monitoring.

The other options are incorrect because they are not the standard treatment for giant cell myocarditis. Option A, placing a percutaneous coronary stent in the left anterior descending artery, is a treatment for coronary artery disease, which is not the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Option B, starting colchicine and NSAIDs with outpatient follow-up in 4 weeks, is a possible treatment for pericarditis, which is an inflammation of the sac that surrounds the heart. However, pericarditis is not the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, and the patient's presentation is more consistent with giant cell myocarditis. Option D, urgently draining the pericardial effusion percutaneously, is a treatment for a pericardial effusion, which is a collection of fluid around the heart. However, the patient does not have a pericardial effusion, and this treatment would not be appropriate in this case.

Erythema gyratum repens is a rare, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that presents with a characteristic annular, gyrate, or serpiginous eruption. The eruption is often associated with an underlying malignancy, most commonly lung adenocarcinoma. The histopathology of erythema gyratum repens shows a perivascular and interstitial lymphocytic infiltrate with epidermotropism. The CD30 immunohistochemical stain is positive in the majority of cases.

The patient in the case presentation presents with a widespread, intermittently pruritic eruption with coalescing annular, arcuate, and serpiginous red scaling plaques in a concentric pattern diffusely involving the chest, back, and abdomen with extension to proximal extremities. The histopathology of the skin biopsy shows epidermal hyperplasia with spongiosis and parakeratosis, a superficial dermal and epidermotropic infiltrate of atypical lymphocytes focally distributed along the dermal-epidermal junction and aggregated in Pautrier microabscesses, and a positive CD30 immunohistochemical stain. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of erythema gyratum repens–like eruption associated with mycosis fungoides.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Erythema gyratum repens associated with lung adenocarcinoma is incorrect because the patient does not have a history of lung cancer.
* Option C: Erythema gyratum repens associated with pityriasis rubra pilaris is incorrect because the patient does not have the characteristic features of pityriasis rubra pilaris, such as follicular hyperkeratosis and erythema.
* Option D: Tinea imbricata is incorrect because the patient does not have the characteristic features of tinea imbricata, such as a kerion and a "shingled" appearance of the skin.

The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of **Fuchs' heterochromic iridocyclitis** (FHI), a rare, bilateral, chronic, non-inflammatory, non-granulomatous uveitis that is characterized by progressive iris atrophy, transillumination defects, and heterochromia. FHI is most commonly diagnosed in middle-aged and older adults, and it is more common in women than men. The exact cause of FHI is unknown, but it is thought to be a genetic disorder. There is no cure for FHI, but treatment can help to manage the symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. Treatment typically includes topical steroids, mydriatics, and cycloplegics. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the iris or to repair the iris defects.

The patient in the case report has a history of progressive, decreased, patchy pigmentation of both eyes; constant photophobia; and constant decreased visual acuity. He also has a family history of glaucoma, which is a common complication of FHI. The patient's examination findings are also consistent with a diagnosis of FHI, including patchy iris atrophy, transillumination defects, and an open anterior chamber angle.

The next step in the management of this patient is to perform genetic testing to confirm the diagnosis of FHI. Genetic testing can also help to identify the specific gene mutation that is responsible for the patient's disease. This information can be used to counsel the patient and his family about the risk of developing FHI and other related eye diseases.

The other options are not correct because they are not the next step in the management of this patient. Anterior segment fluorescein angiography (A) is a diagnostic test that can be used to visualize the blood vessels in the iris and anterior chamber. However, A is not necessary in this case because the diagnosis of FHI is already suspected based on the patient's history and examination findings. Aqueous tap (B) is a diagnostic test that can be used to collect fluid from the anterior chamber of the eye. However, B is not necessary in this case because the diagnosis of FHI is already suspected based on the patient's history and examination findings. Sickle cell testing (C) is a blood test that can be used to detect the sickle cell trait or sickle cell disease. However, C is not necessary in this case because the patient's history and examination findings are not consistent with sickle cell disease.

Explanation:

A persistent trigeminal artery is a rare congenital anomaly that occurs when the trigeminal artery fails to regress during embryological development. The trigeminal artery is a branch of the internal carotid artery that supplies blood to the meninges and brainstem. In cases of persistent trigeminal artery, the artery persists and courses along the side of the face, between the internal carotid artery and the mandible.

The most common presentation of persistent trigeminal artery is a pulsatile mass in the cheek or temporal region. The mass may be associated with pain, headache, or facial numbness. Diagnosis is made with imaging studies, such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

Treatment of persistent trigeminal artery is not always necessary. However, if the mass is symptomatic or there is concern for malignancy, surgical resection may be indicated.

The other options are incorrect because they are not associated with the clinical presentation of persistent trigeminal artery. Schwannomas are benign tumors that arise from Schwann cells, which are the cells that myelinate nerve fibers. Paragangliomas are tumors that arise from paraganglia, which are small collections of neuroendocrine cells that are found throughout the body. Persistent hypoglossal artery is a rare congenital anomaly that occurs when the hypoglossal artery fails to regress during embryological development. The hypoglossal artery is a branch of the internal carotid artery that supplies blood to the tongue.

The patient's presentation is concerning for a diagnosis of acute retinal necrosis (ARN), a rare but sight-threatening infection of the retina caused by varicella-zoster virus (VZV). ARN is typically seen in patients with a history of chickenpox, and it can occur at any age. The most common presenting symptoms are floaters, blurred vision, and pain in the eye. On examination, ARN can be seen as retinal hemorrhages, exudates, and neovascularization.

The definitive diagnosis of ARN is made by performing a vitreous tap and testing the vitreous fluid for VZV DNA. This is the most sensitive and specific test for ARN. Treatment of ARN typically involves intravenous acyclovir and intravitreal injections of ganciclovir. However, in some cases, patients may also require vitrectomy surgery.

In this case, the patient's presentation is highly suggestive of ARN. The patient has a history of chickenpox, and she is currently experiencing floaters, blurred vision, and pain in her right eye. On examination, she has retinal hemorrhages, exudates, and neovascularization. The most appropriate next step is to perform a vitreous tap and test the vitreous fluid for VZV DNA. This will confirm the diagnosis of ARN and allow for appropriate treatment to be initiated.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Option A, observing the patient, is not appropriate because the patient is at risk of losing vision. Option B, performing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the brain, is not appropriate because these tests are not necessary to diagnose ARN. Option D, administering an intravitreal injection of foscarnet, is not appropriate because foscarnet is not a first-line treatment for ARN.

The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, which can lead to vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A deficiency is a known cause of conjunctival keratinization, neovascular fronds, and fornix shortening. The patient also has a history of recent corticosteroid treatment, which can also lead to vitamin A deficiency.

Additionally, the patient's conjunctival biopsy specimen should be evaluated for immune deposits. This is because the patient's symptoms could be caused by an autoimmune disease, such as ocular cicatricial pemphigoid.

Observing the patient after stopping brimonidine-timolol drops without further intervention or evaluation is not the correct answer because the patient's symptoms are likely caused by a medical condition, not by the brimonidine-timolol drops.

Performing extensive excision of the lesion with ocular surface reconstruction, followed by disposal of the biopsy specimen is not the correct answer because the patient's symptoms are likely caused by a medical condition, not by a tumor.

Explanation:
Sweet syndrome, also known as acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, is a rare, febrile, neutrophilic dermatosis characterized by painful, tender, erythematous, edematous plaques and nodules that often ulcerate. It is typically associated with underlying conditions such as malignancy, infection, or medications.

The patient in the case presentation presents with a number of features that are consistent with Sweet syndrome. She is an older woman with a history of malignancy and recent weight loss. She has a sudden onset of painful, edematous, erythematous plaques and nodules that are confluent on her forehead and cheeks with sharp demarcation at the nasolabial folds. She also has a retiform purpuric plaque on her left leg with overlying desquamation.

The patient's laboratory evaluation reveals leukocytosis, normocytic anemia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, hematuria, and proteinuria. These findings are consistent with an inflammatory process.

The patient's computed tomography of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis reveals parenchymal lung nodules. These findings could be due to underlying malignancy or infection.

The patient's punch biopsies of the skin show a dense infiltrate of neutrophils in the dermis. This finding is consistent with Sweet syndrome.

The patient's diagnosis of Sweet syndrome is supported by her clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging studies.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), also known as Wegener granulomatosis, is a rare, systemic vasculitis that typically affects the small and medium-sized arteries. It is characterized by necrotizing granulomas in the respiratory tract and kidneys. GPA can also affect the skin, joints, eyes, and central nervous system.

The patient in the case presentation does not have any features that are consistent with GPA. She does not have any respiratory symptoms, and her kidneys are not affected. She also does not have any other organ involvement that is typical of GPA.

Cryptococcal infection is a fungal infection that can affect the lungs, central nervous system, and other organs. It is typically seen in people who are immunocompromised, such as those with AIDS or cancer.

The patient in the case presentation does not have any features that are consistent with cryptococcal infection. She is not immunocompromised, and she does not have any symptoms of cryptococcal meningitis.

Drug-induced vasculitis is a type of vasculitis that is caused by a reaction to a medication. It can affect any blood vessel in the body, but it is most commonly seen in the skin, kidneys, and lungs.

The patient in the case presentation does not have any features that are consistent with drug-induced vasculitis. She is not taking any medications that are known to cause vasculitis, and she does not have any symptoms of drug-induced vasculitis.

The patient presents with a 15-year history of dull midline lower back pain associated with bilateral hip pain. He also noted bilateral hand pain along the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) and proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joints and prolonged morning stiffness lasting approximately 45 minutes. Family history was notable for a brother with osteoarthritis, hypogonadism, and type 2 diabetes.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with ankylosing spondylitis, a chronic inflammatory disease of the axial skeleton. Ankylosing spondylitis is characterized by sacroiliitis, inflammation of the sacroiliac joints, and spondylitis, inflammation of the spine. The patient's plain radiographs show sclerosis and joint narrowing at both sacroiliac joints as well as joint narrowing and osteophytes in the hip joints bilaterally. These findings are consistent with ankylosing spondylitis.

The next step in the management of this patient is to order a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the sacroiliac joint. MRI is a more sensitive test than plain radiographs for the diagnosis of sacroiliitis. An MRI of the sacroiliac joint will show the extent of the inflammation and help to confirm the diagnosis of ankylosing spondylitis.

The other answers are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Answer A: Check ferritin and transferrin saturation. This is not necessary in a patient with a history and physical examination consistent with ankylosing spondylitis.
* Answer B: Check rheumatoid factor (RF). RF is a non-specific test that can be elevated in a variety of inflammatory conditions, including rheumatoid arthritis. The patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with rheumatoid arthritis.
* Answer D: Refer for surgical consultation. Surgical consultation is not necessary at this time. The patient's symptoms are well-controlled with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the best test to evaluate the structure and function of the heart. It is a non-invasive test that does not use radiation. It can provide detailed images of the heart muscle, valves, and blood vessels.

In this case, the patient has a history of a childhood heart murmur that was never evaluated. She is now experiencing decreased exercise tolerance, shortness of breath, and heart palpitations. These symptoms could be due to a number of conditions, including heart disease, pulmonary embolism, or anemia. Cardiac MRI is the best test to evaluate the heart and rule out these conditions.

Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) are medications that are used to treat heart disease. They work by relaxing the blood vessels and reducing blood pressure. ACE inhibitors are not the best test to evaluate the heart in this case.

Cardiac catheterization is a procedure that is used to diagnose and treat heart disease. It is a minimally invasive procedure that involves inserting a catheter into a blood vessel in the groin and threading it up to the heart. Cardiac catheterization is not the best test to evaluate the heart in this case.

Referral to a pulmonologist is not necessary in this case. The patient's symptoms are not consistent with a pulmonary embolism or other pulmonary condition.

Explanation:

The patient's history of AML and allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant 13 months earlier is significant for the development of chloroma, a rare cutaneous manifestation of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Chloroma is characterized by green-gray nodules or plaques that are often located on the head, neck, and upper trunk. The lesions are typically asymptomatic and do not require treatment, but they may be associated with systemic symptoms such as fever, fatigue, and weight loss.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not associated with AML or allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare, aggressive skin cancer that is most common in older adults. Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm is a rare type of cancer that affects the white blood cells. Histiocytoid Sweet syndrome is a rare inflammatory condition that can affect the skin, eyes, and joints.

In conclusion, the patient's diagnosis is most likely chloroma. This is supported by the patient's history of AML and allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplant, as well as the appearance of green-gray nodules on the chest.

Explanation:
The patient in this case presents with a number of symptoms and findings that are consistent with Churg-Strauss syndrome. These include:

* Dizziness and fatigue
* Tingling in both lower extremities
* Gait disturbances
* Mild proximal pyramidal weakness of the left leg
* Brisk reflexes and extensor plantar response
* Hypoesthesia below the T2 level
* Mild decrement in position sense
* Marked decrement of vibration sense in both lower extremities
* Enlarged cervical and supraclavicular lymph nodes
* Multiple enhancing lesions on brain and cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
* Acellular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
* Elevated eosinophilic count
* Negative tests for B-cell clones, viral, and fungal infections
* Negative antibodies for AQP4, MOG, and paraneoplastic syndromes
* Generalized lymphadenopathy on whole-body fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)
* Normal results on whole-body gallium scan, chest high-resolution computed tomography (CT), and bone marrow biopsy
* Nonspecific reactive lymphadenopathy on axillary and inguinal lymph node biopsies
* Exclusion of parasitic infections by plasma and CSF antibodies testing with enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), stool, and lymph node microscopy
* Inconclusive results of extensive diagnostic workup for malignancies and systemic autoimmune diseases

Churg-Strauss syndrome is a rare, multisystem vasculitis characterized by the infiltration of blood vessels with eosinophils. It can affect any part of the body, but the most common sites of involvement are the lungs, heart, kidneys, and skin. The symptoms of Churg-Strauss syndrome can vary depending on the organs involved, but they can include fever, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue, weight loss, joint pain, skin rash, and neurological problems.

The diagnosis of Churg-Strauss syndrome is based on a combination of clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The characteristic finding on biopsy is the presence of eosinophilic infiltration of the blood vessels. Treatment of Churg-Strauss syndrome typically involves the use of corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants. The prognosis for patients with Churg-Strauss syndrome is variable, but with appropriate treatment, most patients can expect to make a good recovery.

The other possible diagnoses in this case are all less likely than Churg-Strauss syndrome. Encephalomyelitis with hyperIgEaemia is a rare disorder characterized by the inflammation of the brain and spinal cord in association with an elevated level of immunoglobulin E (IgE). It typically presents in children with a history of allergic conditions. Eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss syndrome) is a more likely diagnosis in this case given the patient's age and the presence of systemic involvement. Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymph nodes. It can present with a variety of symptoms, including fever, night sweats, weight loss, and lymph node enlargement. Sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect any part of the body, but it most commonly affects the lungs, lymph nodes, skin, and eyes. It can present with a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, fever, cough, and skin rash.

Explanation:

The patient's history and physical examination findings are concerning for esophageal and pulmonary tuberculosis. Esophageal tuberculosis is a rare condition that is most commonly seen in patients with HIV infection. It can present with dysphagia, chest pain, and weight loss. Pulmonary tuberculosis is a more common condition that can present with dyspnea, cough, and fever.

A barium esophagram can be helpful in diagnosing esophageal tuberculosis. It can show narrowing of the esophagus, which can be caused by the formation of granulomas. A chest radiography can be helpful in diagnosing pulmonary tuberculosis. It can show infiltrates in the lungs, which can be caused by the growth of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Endoscopy is the most definitive test for diagnosing esophageal tuberculosis. It allows the physician to visualize the esophagus and take biopsies of any suspicious areas. Biopsies can be tested for the presence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Transesophageal echocardiogram is a test that uses ultrasound to look at the heart. It is not typically used to diagnose esophageal tuberculosis.

Computed tomography angiography of the aorta is a test that uses X-rays to look at the aorta. It is not typically used to diagnose esophageal tuberculosis.

Right and left heart catheterization is a test that is used to measure the pressures in the heart and lungs. It is not typically used to diagnose esophageal tuberculosis.

Therefore, the next step in the management of this patient is to perform endoscopy to rule out esophageal and pulmonary tuberculosis.

The patient has corneal edema, which is a swelling of the cornea. This can be caused by a number of things, including infection, inflammation, and injury. In this case, the most likely cause is her recent vitreous hemorrhage. The vitreous is a jelly-like substance that fills the inside of the eye. When it hemorrhages, it can cause inflammation and swelling of the cornea.

Topical corticosteroid eyedrops are a common treatment for corneal edema. They work by reducing inflammation and swelling. They are usually started as soon as possible after the onset of symptoms. In most cases, they are effective in reducing inflammation and improving vision.

Intrastromal injection of anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a newer treatment for corneal edema. It is used in cases where topical corticosteroid eyedrops are not effective. VEGF is a protein that promotes the growth of new blood vessels. In the case of corneal edema, new blood vessels can grow into the cornea, which can worsen the swelling. Intrastromal injection of anti–VEGF works by blocking the action of VEGF, which can help to reduce the swelling.

Beginning oral and/or topical antiviral medications is not the best treatment for this patient. The patient does not have any evidence of an infection, and antiviral medications are not effective against inflammation.

Performing an endothelial keratoplasty is a surgical procedure that is used to treat corneal edema. It is only used in cases where other treatments have failed. In this case, the patient has not had any other treatments, so it is premature to consider surgery.

Therefore, the best treatment for this patient is to start topical corticosteroid eyedrops.

Explanation: The patient in this case presented with a 7-month history of episodes of back and abdominal pain associated with nausea, vomiting, and flushing. Immediately following workup with noncontrast abdominal ultrasonography, he experienced intense flushing and vomiting. Subsequent contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging identified a 5-cm thoracic paraspinal mass. Computed tomography–guided biopsy of the paraspinal mass revealed a dense cellular infiltrate on histopathology composed of cells with round nuclei and abundant pale cytoplasm.

These findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of myeloid sarcoma. Myeloid sarcoma is a rare, aggressive form of cancer that arises from myeloid cells in the bone marrow. It can present with a variety of symptoms, including fever, bone pain, weight loss, and fatigue. Myeloid sarcoma is often diagnosed after imaging studies reveal a mass in the bone marrow or other organs. Treatment for myeloid sarcoma typically involves chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

The other options are incorrect because they do not fit the patient's clinical presentation. Histiocytoma is a benign tumor that arises from histiocytes, which are white blood cells that help the body fight infection. Mastocytoma is a benign tumor that arises from mast cells, which are cells that release histamine and other chemicals in response to allergic reactions. Malignant pheochromocytoma is a rare, aggressive form of cancer that arises from chromaffin cells in the adrenal glands. It can present with symptoms such as hypertension, sweating, and palpitations.

Explanation:
The patient has a severe, progressive, and sight-threatening infection of the retina and vitreous. The patient has already received broad-spectrum intravenous and intravitreal antibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals, but his condition has continued to worsen. There is no evidence that the patient's immune system is compromised, so increasing systemic immunosuppressive therapy is not likely to be beneficial. A transscleral subretinal biopsy would be a risky procedure that is unlikely to provide any benefit. Repeated diagnostic vitrectomy with repeated subretinal biopsy would also be a risky procedure that is unlikely to provide any benefit. The best course of treatment is to continue the patient on intravitreal injections of antibacterial, antifungal, and antiviral medications. These medications may not be able to cure the infection, but they may help to control the infection and prevent further damage to the retina.

Explanation:
The most likely diagnosis in this case is cutaneous leishmaniasis, a parasitic infection caused by the Leishmania parasite. The infection is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected sand fly. The most common clinical presentation of cutaneous leishmaniasis is a single, non-tender, ulcerated nodule on the exposed skin, such as the hands and feet. The lesion may be crusted or have a raised border. In some cases, the lesion may heal spontaneously, but in others it may persist for months or even years.

The diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis is usually made based on the clinical presentation and the results of a skin biopsy. The biopsy specimen will show the presence of the Leishmania parasite in the skin.

There are a number of treatment options for cutaneous leishmaniasis, including topical and systemic medications. The choice of treatment will depend on the severity of the infection and the patient's overall health.

Herpetic whitlow is a viral infection caused by the herpes simplex virus. The infection is usually transmitted through contact with infected saliva or blisters. The most common clinical presentation of herpetic whitlow is a painful, vesicular lesion on the finger. The lesion may be accompanied by fever and lymphadenopathy.

Bacterial paronychia is an infection of the nail fold caused by bacteria. The infection is usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. The most common clinical presentation of bacterial paronychia is a tender, erythematous swelling of the nail fold. The lesion may be accompanied by fever and lymphadenopathy.

Pyogenic granuloma is a benign vascular tumor that can occur anywhere on the body. The most common clinical presentation of pyogenic granuloma is a small, red, raised lesion with a central crust. The lesion may bleed easily.

In this case, the patient is a young girl who has a chronic, non-tender, ulcerated lesion on her left index finger. The lesion has been present for 7 months and has not responded to treatment with oral antibiotics or antivirals. The patient's family reports living in a rural area on the Mediterranean coast. These findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis.

The patient in this case developed new keratic precipitates in coin-shaped aggregates along with new anterior chamber (AC) inflammation six weeks after DMEK. This is concerning for cytomegalovirus (CMV) endotheliitis, which is a common complication of DMEK. CMV endotheliitis is typically treated with antiviral therapy, such as ganciclovir or foscarnet. However, before starting antiviral therapy, it is important to confirm the diagnosis with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test of aqueous humor for CMV DNA. This is because other conditions, such as rejection, can also cause keratic precipitates and AC inflammation. If the PCR test is positive, then antiviral therapy can be started. If the PCR test is negative, then other treatments, such as increasing the frequency or potency of steroids, may be necessary.

A, C, and D are incorrect because they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Increasing the frequency or potency of steroids may help to control the inflammation, but it will not treat the underlying infection. Performing a vitreous tap with intravitreal antibiotic injection may be necessary if the patient develops endophthalmitis, but it is not necessary in the early stages of CMV endotheliitis. Empirical treatment with acyclovir is not recommended in the absence of a confirmed diagnosis of CMV infection.

Esthesioneuroblastoma is a rare, highly malignant tumor of the olfactory epithelium. It is the most common primary malignant tumor of the nasal cavity. The tumor usually presents as a painless mass in the nasal cavity or paranasal sinuses. Symptoms may include nasal obstruction, epistaxis, headache, facial pain, and anosmia.

The diagnosis of esthesioneuroblastoma is made by biopsy. The tumor is typically positive for olfactory markers, such as synaptophysin and chromogranin.

The treatment of esthesioneuroblastoma is surgical resection. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy may also be used. The prognosis for esthesioneuroblastoma is poor, with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 50%.

The other options are incorrect because they are not typically associated with the clinical presentation and imaging findings described in the case.

Explanation: The patient has a history of oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) that was treated with concurrent radiation therapy and cetuximab. He subsequently developed a palpable left supraclavicular lymph node, which was found to be positive for SCC on biopsy. Restaging FDG-PET/CT demonstrated avid supraclavicular and anterolateral neck adenopathy, as well as moderately intense activity isolated to the left thyroid lobe. Ultrasonography of the thyroid demonstrated a 4-cm mass within the gland, and subsequent biopsy was performed with immunohistochemistry staining positive for p16, CK5, and p40 and negative for thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1). These findings are consistent with metastatic SCC to the thyroid.

Papillary thyroid carcinoma is the most common type of thyroid cancer, but it is typically not associated with a history of SCC. Thyroid lymphoma is also rare, and it is more likely to occur in patients with a history of autoimmune thyroid disease. Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is a very aggressive type of thyroid cancer that is typically seen in older patients. The patient's age and lack of a history of autoimmune thyroid disease make anaplastic thyroid carcinoma less likely.

The patient is a 61-year-old woman with a history of hypertension who presents with exertional left calf discomfort. She has no history of spinal degenerative disease and does not have lower extremity arterial bruits, wounds, sensory deficits, edema, or hair loss. Results of an exercise treadmill ankle-brachial index (ABI) test are shown in the Table.

The ABI is a non-invasive test that is used to assess the patency of the arteries in the legs. The test is performed by measuring the blood pressure in the ankle and the arm. A normal ABI is greater than 1.0. An ABI of less than 0.9 indicates the presence of peripheral artery disease (PAD).

In this case, the patient's ABI is 0.85, which is consistent with the diagnosis of PAD. PAD is a condition in which the arteries in the legs become narrowed or blocked, which can reduce blood flow to the legs. This can cause symptoms such as pain, cramping, and fatigue in the legs.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to order a lower extremity arterial duplex ultrasound. This is a non-invasive test that uses sound waves to create images of the arteries in the legs. The test can be used to confirm the diagnosis of PAD and to assess the severity of the disease.

If the patient is found to have PAD, she will need to be treated to prevent further progression of the disease. Treatment options for PAD include lifestyle changes, such as quitting smoking and exercising regularly, and medications, such as statins and ACE inhibitors. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to open up the narrowed or blocked arteries.

The other options are incorrect because:

* Option A: Diagnosing the patient with PAD and beginning medical management is premature without further testing.
* Option B: Ordering a lower extremity angiogram is an invasive procedure that is not necessary in this case.
* Option D: Reassuring the patient that her pain is nonvascular in origin is incorrect, as the patient has a significant risk of developing serious complications from PAD.

The patient has a history of uterine carcinoma, which is a type of cancer that starts in the uterus. She has been without symptoms for 30 years, but now presents with abdominal pain and distention. The physical examination and imaging studies are consistent with a diagnosis of appendicitis. Appendicitis is a condition in which the appendix, a small, finger-shaped organ that projects from the colon, becomes inflamed. The most common symptom of appendicitis is abdominal pain, which is typically located in the right lower abdomen. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and fever.

The treatment for appendicitis is surgery to remove the appendix. This can be done laparoscopically, which is a minimally invasive procedure, or through an open incision. In the case of this patient, laparoscopic appendectomy is the preferred approach because it is less invasive and has a shorter recovery time.

The peritoneal biopsy is done to rule out the possibility of cancer. The peritoneum is the membrane that lines the abdominal cavity. If cancer has spread to the peritoneum, it is called peritoneal carcinomatosis. Peritoneal carcinomatosis is a serious condition that is often fatal. However, there are treatments available that can help to control the cancer and improve the quality of life for patients.

The other options are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate treatment for this patient. Order repeat image-guided paracentesis/cytology is not the best option because the previous paracentesis was nondiagnostic. Order colonoscopy with biopsy is not the best option because the patient has no symptoms of colon cancer. Order broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover gram-negative and anaerobic enteric species is not the best option because the patient does not have an infection.

Explanation:

The most likely diagnosis is Koebnerized psoriasis vulgaris. This is a type of psoriasis that occurs at the site of a prior injury. The patient's history of a mildly pruritic plaque on the elbow at the site of a prior injury, the physical examination findings of a solitary, well-circumscribed pink plaque with overlying yellow-white micaceous scale with interspersed punctate hemorrhagic crusts, and the histopathologic findings of psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia overlying suppurative granulomatous infiltrates with multinucleate giant cells and rare eosinophilic spheroid forms are all consistent with this diagnosis.

Sporotrichosis is a fungal infection that can cause skin lesions, but it is more common in the lower extremities. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a systemic vasculitis that can cause skin lesions, but it is more likely to cause fever, joint pain, and kidney problems.

Explanation:

The patient is in asystole, which is a state of cardiac arrest. The first step in management is to initiate cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Once CPR is underway, the next step is to determine the cause of the cardiac arrest. In this case, the patient had a high-grade distal left main coronary artery (LM) bifurcation lesion extending predominantly into the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). This lesion was successfully treated with transradial PCI, but the patient subsequently became hypotensive and experienced an asystolic cardiac arrest. The most likely cause of the cardiac arrest is myocardial ischemia due to the high-grade LM lesion.

VA ECMO is a life-support therapy that can be used to provide temporary circulatory support to patients who are in cardiac arrest or who have severe heart failure. VA ECMO involves the placement of two catheters, one in the venous system and one in the arterial system. The venous catheter draws blood from the patient's body, and the arterial catheter returns oxygenated blood back to the patient's body. VA ECMO can provide enough circulatory support to allow the patient's heart to rest and recover.

In this case, the patient is in cardiac arrest and is unlikely to survive without intervention. VA ECMO is the most appropriate intervention to provide temporary circulatory support and allow the patient's heart to rest and recover. The other options are not appropriate interventions for a patient in cardiac arrest. Option A, inserting a percutaneous left ventricular assist device (LVAD), is a permanent intervention that is not appropriate for a patient in cardiac arrest. Option B, performing pericardiocentesis with autologous blood transfusion, is a procedure that is used to treat pericardial tamponade, which is not the patient's current problem. Option D, performing root and ascending aortography, is a diagnostic procedure that is not appropriate for a patient in cardiac arrest.

A saccular cyst is a fluid-filled sac that can develop in the vocal folds. It is usually caused by trauma or inflammation. Chondroid metaplasia is the transformation of normal tissue into cartilage. It is usually a benign process. Chondroma is a benign tumor of cartilage. Chondrosarcoma is a malignant tumor of cartilage.

In this case, the patient had a firm lesion in the left paraglottic space extending to the lateral aspect of the true vocal fold. A subtle but similar finding was seen on the right true vocal fold, not causing any mass effect. An incision was made in the mucosa of the ventricle overlying the lesion at its lateral extent, and a mucosal flap was elevated over the lesion. This revealed a cartilaginous lesion, which was removed using an AcuBlade CO2 laser (Lumenis) and cup forceps until the cartilaginous edge was smooth within the paraglottic space. The histologic specimen showed fragments of cartilage with no nuclear atypia or mitosis.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of chondroma. Chondromas are benign tumors of cartilage that are usually found in the bones. They can also occur in the soft tissues, such as the vocal folds. Chondromas are usually small and slow-growing. They rarely cause symptoms, but they can sometimes cause pain or pressure. Treatment for chondromas usually involves surgical removal.

The other possible diagnoses are not consistent with the patient's history and findings. Saccular cysts are usually caused by trauma or inflammation. They are usually small and do not cause symptoms. Chondroid metaplasia is the transformation of normal tissue into cartilage. It is usually a benign process. Chondrosarcoma is a malignant tumor of cartilage.

Explanation:

The patient is a 57-year-old African American man who presents with a brown pigmented patch on the left side of the hard palate. The lesion is of unknown duration and is reported by the patient to be asymptomatic, although he did endorse occasional pruritus. An extraoral examination was performed without any abnormal findings. On intraoral soft tissue examination, a brown pigmented patch located predominantly on the hard palate was observed. The lesion had well-defined but irregular borders, measured 2 × 1.2 cm in size, and was nontender to palpation. Findings of the remainder of the intraoral soft tissue examination were within normal limits. An incisional biopsy was performed, and the specimen was sent for microscopic diagnosis.

Histologic examination findings revealed soft tissue covered by benign-appearing stratified squamous epithelium, focally spongiotic and acanthotic. Within the epithelium, numerous benign dendritic melanocytes were identified. The underlying connective tissues were unremarkable.

The differential diagnosis for a pigmented lesion on the hard palate includes focal melanotic macule (focal melanosis), oral melanoacanthosis (melanoacanthoma), blue nevus, and malignant melanoma.

Focal melanotic macule is a benign condition characterized by a single, small, brown or black macule on the skin or mucous membranes. It is most commonly seen in people of African descent, and it is thought to be caused by an increase in the number of melanocytes in the skin. Focal melanotic macules are usually asymptomatic and do not require treatment.

Oral melanoacanthosis is a rare condition characterized by a single, dark brown or black macule on the oral mucosa. It is most commonly seen in people of African descent, and it is thought to be caused by an increase in the number of melanocytes in the oral mucosa. Oral melanoacanthoses are usually asymptomatic and do not require treatment.

Blue nevus is a benign condition characterized by a small, blue or black macule or papule on the skin. It is most commonly seen in children and young adults, and it is thought to be caused by an abnormal proliferation of melanocytes in the skin. Blue nevi are usually asymptomatic and do not require treatment.

Malignant melanoma is a malignant neoplasm of melanocytes. It is the most serious type of skin cancer, and it can spread to other parts of the body. Malignant melanomas can occur anywhere on the skin, but they are most commonly seen on the back, legs, and arms. Malignant melanomas can be divided into four main types: superficial spreading melanoma, nodular melanoma, lentigo maligna melanoma, and acral lentiginous melanoma.

The patient in this case presents with a brown pigmented patch on the hard palate that is of unknown duration and is asymptomatic. The lesion has well-defined but irregular borders, measures 2 × 1.2 cm in size, and is nontender to palpation. Findings of the remainder of the intraoral soft tissue examination are within normal limits. An incisional biopsy was performed, and the specimen was sent for microscopic diagnosis. Histologic examination findings revealed soft tissue covered by benign-appearing stratified squamous epithelium, focally spongiotic and acanthotic. Within the epithelium, numerous benign dendritic melanocytes were identified. The underlying connective tissues were unremarkable.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination findings, and biopsy results, the most likely diagnosis is focal melanotic macule. Focal melanotic macules are benign conditions that are characterized by a single, small, brown or black macule on the skin or mucous membranes. They are most commonly seen in people of African descent, and they are thought to be caused by an increase in the number of melanocytes in the skin. Focal melanotic macules are usually asymptomatic and do not require treatment.

The other possible diagnoses in this case are oral melanoacanthosis, blue nevus, and malignant melanoma. However, oral melanoacanthoses and blue nevi are usually asymptomatic, and they do not have the irregular borders or spongiosis and acanthosis that are seen in the patient's lesion. Malignant melanoma is a serious condition that can spread to other parts of the body. However, the patient's lesion is small, superficial, and well-defined, and it does not have the high-risk features of malignant melanoma, such as ulceration, asymmetry, and bleeding.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for the patient in this case is focal melanotic macule.

Schwannomas are benign tumors that arise from Schwann cells, which are the cells that myelinate nerve fibers. They are the most common type of nerve sheath tumor, and they can occur anywhere in the body where there are nerves. Schwannomas are typically slow-growing tumors, and they rarely metastasize.

The most common symptom of a schwannoma is a mass that can be felt on examination. Other symptoms may include numbness, tingling, or weakness in the area supplied by the affected nerve. In some cases, schwannomas can cause pain.

The diagnosis of a schwannoma is usually made with imaging studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI can show the location and size of the tumor, as well as its relationship to surrounding structures. In some cases, a biopsy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

The treatment of a schwannoma depends on the size and location of the tumor, as well as the symptoms that it is causing. Small, asymptomatic schwannomas may not require treatment. Larger tumors or tumors that are causing symptoms may be treated with surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.

In the case of the patient in the question, the history and physical examination are consistent with a schwannoma. The MRI shows a well-circumscribed, T1 isointense, T2 hyperintense mass in the left masticator space. This is the typical appearance of a schwannoma on MRI. The patient's lack of symptoms and the benign appearance of the tumor on imaging suggest that the tumor is likely benign. The most likely diagnosis is therefore a schwannoma.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Juvenile angiofibromas are benign tumors that occur in the nasopharynx. They are most common in adolescent boys. Juvenile angiofibromas can cause nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and facial pain.
* Odontogenic keratocysts are benign tumors that arise from the lining of the tooth socket. They are most common in young adults. Odontogenic keratocysts can cause tooth displacement, pain, and swelling.
* Chondrosarcomas are malignant tumors that arise from cartilage. They are most common in the pelvis and shoulder. Chondrosarcomas can cause pain, swelling, and a mass.

Explanation:
The patient is a young adult nonsmoker with a history of asthma who presented with a palpable mass on the left side of the neck that had been present for several months, reportedly unchanged. The patient had been treated presumptively for infection with antibiotics, with no improvement. No fever, odynophagia, dysphagia, otalgia, or other constitutional symptoms were reported. Physical examination findings demonstrated a palpable, soft, nontender left level II/III neck mass. Clinical examination findings of the thyroid and upper aerodigestive tract were unremarkable. Contrast-enhanced neck computed tomography (CT) showed a large avidly enhancing mass centered at the left carotid bifurcation splaying the internal and external carotid arteries and extending cranially along the cervical internal carotid artery. The left internal jugular vein was displaced posteriorly. There was also a smaller mass with similar appearance at the right carotid bifurcation. Contrast-enhanced abdominal CT showed several enhancing masses in the liver. Based on CT findings, gallium Ga 68 (68Ga) dotatate positron emission tomography (PET)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed; results demonstrated intense radiotracer avidity in bilateral carotid space masses, hepatic masses, and numerous CT occult osseous lesions.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes a variety of neoplasms that can metastasize to the neck and liver, including sarcoma, lymphoma, and carcinoma. The presence of a large, avidly enhancing mass at the carotid bifurcation, with extension cranially along the internal carotid artery, is highly suggestive of a sarcoma. This is supported by the findings on gallium 68 dotatate PET/MRI, which showed intense radiotracer uptake in the bilateral carotid space masses, hepatic masses, and numerous CT occult osseous lesions.

Lymphoma is a less likely diagnosis in this patient, as it is typically not associated with large, avidly enhancing masses. Carcinoma is also a possibility, but it is less likely than sarcoma in a young adult patient with no history of smoking or other risk factors for carcinoma.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is metastatic sarcoma.

Indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) is a diagnostic procedure that uses a special dye to visualize the blood vessels in the retina. It is often used to diagnose and monitor conditions that affect the blood vessels in the retina, such as diabetic retinopathy, macular degeneration, and retinal vein occlusion.

In this case, the patient has bilateral central scotoma, which is a loss of vision in the center of the visual field. This can be caused by a number of conditions, including optic neuritis, macular degeneration, and retinal vein occlusion. ICGA can help to determine the cause of the central scotoma and to assess the extent of the damage to the retina.

The other options are not as likely to be helpful in this case. B, discontinuing immunosuppression therapy, is not likely to be helpful because the patient's vision loss is not likely to be caused by his immunosuppression therapy. C, ordering optical coherence tomography (OCT), is a possible option, but ICGA is more likely to provide useful information in this case. D, repeating neuroimaging, is not likely to be helpful because the patient's MRI scan was unremarkable.

Therefore, the best option is to obtain ICGA.

Explanation:
The patient presented with bilateral optic nerve edema, which is a sign of increased intracranial pressure (ICP). The patient denied having any symptoms of increased ICP, including headaches, pulsatile tinnitus, and transient visual obscurations. However, the patient's MRI showed signs of increased ICP, including empty sella, posterior flattening of the globes, and widened optic nerve sheaths.

To further evaluate the patient's condition, the next step would be to obtain venography (computed tomography or magnetic resonance) of the brain. Venography is a procedure that uses X-rays or magnetic resonance imaging to visualize the veins in the brain. This procedure can help to identify the cause of the patient's increased ICP, such as a brain tumor or a bleed in the brain.

The other options are incorrect because they would not provide any further information about the patient's condition. Option A, obtaining enhanced depth imaging–optical coherence tomography, is a procedure that uses sound waves to create images of the optic nerve. This procedure can be used to diagnose optic nerve edema, but it would not provide any information about the cause of the patient's edema. Option B, performing lumbar puncture with opening pressure, is a procedure in which a needle is inserted into the spinal canal to measure the pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid. This procedure can help to diagnose increased ICP, but it would not provide any information about the cause of the patient's ICP. Option D, prescribing acetazolamide, is a medication that can be used to reduce ICP. However, this medication would not be effective in treating the patient's condition without knowing the cause of his ICP.

Explanation:

The patient has a history of heavy tobacco and alcohol consumption, which are risk factors for vitamin B12 and folate deficiency. Vitamin B12 and folate are essential for the proper functioning of the optic nerve, and deficiency can lead to optic neuropathy. The patient's symptoms, including gradual vision loss in both eyes, are consistent with optic neuropathy. Therefore, it is important to assess the patient's serum vitamin B12 and folate levels to rule out deficiency.

Liver function tests are not necessary in this case, as the patient's history and examination findings are not consistent with liver disease. Treatment with disulfiram is not indicated, as the patient does not have alcohol use disorder. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain is not necessary at this time, as the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a central nervous system disorder.

In addition to assessing the patient's serum vitamin B12 and folate levels, it is also important to counsel the patient on the risks of heavy tobacco and alcohol consumption. The patient should be advised to quit smoking and to limit his alcohol intake. He should also be encouraged to eat a healthy diet and to get regular exercise.

Explanation:

The patient has developed corneal edema after starting netarsudil. This is a known side effect of netarsudil, and it is the most likely explanation for the patient's symptoms. Stopping netarsudil should resolve the corneal edema.

The other options are incorrect because they would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Stopping timolol or latanoprost would not lower the patient's intraocular pressure, which is not the cause of the corneal edema. Resuming dorzolamide would not be appropriate because the patient has already developed corneal edema while taking dorzolamide.

In addition to stopping netarsudil, the patient may also need to be treated with topical steroids to reduce inflammation and promote healing of the cornea. The patient should also be monitored closely for signs of progression of the glaucoma, as the corneal edema may be a sign that the intraocular pressure is not being adequately controlled.

Explanation:

The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are consistent with systemic sclerosis (SSc). SSc is a rare autoimmune disease characterized by fibrosis of the skin and internal organs. The most common initial manifestations of SSc are Raynaud's phenomenon, digital ulcers, and telangiectasias. Raynaud's phenomenon is characterized by episodic vasospasm of the digits, resulting in pallor, cyanosis, and rubor. Digital ulcers are painful, nonhealing lesions that typically occur on the fingertips and toes. Telangiectasias are small, dilated blood vessels that can be seen on the skin, lips, and mucous membranes.

The patient's laboratory findings are also consistent with SSc. ANA is a non-specific marker of autoimmunity that is found in high titers in the majority of patients with SSc. Anti-Ro52, anti-Ro60, and anti-Scl-70 are autoantibodies that are specific for SSc.

The patient's imaging studies are normal, which suggests that her SSc is limited to the skin and digits.

The patient's treatment should be aimed at reducing inflammation and preventing fibrosis. Intravenous pulse-dose methylprednisolone is a first-line treatment for SSc. Heparin and vasodilator therapy are not indicated for SSc. Empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy is not indicated in the absence of infection.

Therefore, the best next step in the management of this patient is to give intravenous pulse-dose methylprednisolone.

Explanation:

Plaque and ichthyosiform sarcoidosis is a rare variant of sarcoidosis that presents with characteristic skin lesions. The lesions are typically erythematous, indurated plaques with overlying coarse scale. They are often found on the lower extremities, but can also occur on the arms, trunk, and face.

The diagnosis of plaque and ichthyosiform sarcoidosis is made based on the clinical presentation and histopathologic findings. The histopathologic findings are characteristic of sarcoidosis, with non-caseating granulomas in the dermis.

The treatment of plaque and ichthyosiform sarcoidosis is similar to that of other forms of sarcoidosis. The mainstay of treatment is corticosteroids. Other medications that may be used include methotrexate, azathioprine, and infliximab.

The prognosis of plaque and ichthyosiform sarcoidosis is variable. Some patients have a mild, self-limited disease, while others have a more severe, progressive disease. The long-term prognosis is generally good, but some patients may experience long-term sequelae, such as scarring and joint pain.

The other options are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation.

B. Lymphomatoid granulomatosis is a rare, non-Hodgkin lymphoma that presents with a variety of clinical features, including fever, cough, weight loss, and skin lesions. The skin lesions are typically violaceous papules or nodules that may ulcerate.

C. Interstitial granulomatous dermatitis is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease that presents with erythematous, indurated plaques with overlying scale. The lesions are often found on the lower extremities, but can also occur on the arms, trunk, and face.

D. Cutaneous tuberculosis is a rare form of tuberculosis that presents with skin lesions. The lesions are typically erythematous, indurated nodules that may ulcerate. They are often found on the extremities, but can also occur on the trunk and face.

Explanation:

The patient is a man in his 60s with a 1-year history of a pruritic, dark red plaque on his right upper eyelid. The lesion is erythematous, violaceous, indurated, scaly, and has some papules. Histopathologic analysis reveals perifollicular lymphocytic infiltrates around cystically dilated follicular infundibula and exocytosis of atypical lymphocytes into the epithelium, with admixed plasma cells, eosinophils, and multinucleate giant cells. Alcian blue staining shows focal mild follicular mucin deposition. Immunohistochemical analysis shows lymphocytic infiltrates positive for CD3, CD4, CD5, and CD7 and negative for CD8, CD20, CD30, CD79a, and CD56. The ratio of CD4 to CD8 cells within hair follicles is greater than 7:1. Monoclonal T-cell gene rearrangement was demonstrated.

These findings are consistent with unilesional folliculotropic mycosis fungoides, a rare variant of mycosis fungoides that presents as a solitary skin lesion. The lesion is typically a plaque or papule on the head or neck, and it may be pruritic. Histopathologic analysis shows a perifollicular lymphocytic infiltrate with exocytosis of atypical lymphocytes into the epithelium. Immunohistochemical analysis shows a predominance of CD4+ T cells. Monoclonal T-cell gene rearrangement is often found.

The differential diagnosis for unilesional folliculotropic mycosis fungoides includes other T-cell lymphomas, such as Sézary syndrome and primary cutaneous CD30-positive T-cell lymphoma. However, these disorders typically present with multiple lesions, rather than a solitary lesion.

The treatment of unilesional folliculotropic mycosis fungoides is typically with topical corticosteroids or PUVA therapy. In some cases, systemic therapy may be necessary. The prognosis for unilesional folliculotropic mycosis fungoides is good, with most patients achieving long-term remission with treatment.

The other options are incorrect because they do not fit the patient's clinical presentation. Discoid lupus erythematosus is a chronic autoimmune disorder that can affect the skin, joints, and other organs. It typically presents with erythematous, scaly plaques on the face, scalp, and ears. Facial papules in frontal fibrosing alopecia is a rare condition that is characterized by the development of papules and plaques on the forehead, which can progress to scarring alopecia. Unilesional folliculotropic mycosis fungoides is a rare variant of mycosis fungoides that presents as a solitary skin lesion. Jessner lymphocytic infiltrate is a rare, benign skin condition that is characterized by the eruption of papules and plaques on the face.

Explanation: The patient has a history of follicular lymphoma, which is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that can involve the central nervous system. The MRI findings are consistent with central nervous system lymphoma, which is a known complication of chronic rituximab treatment. The other options are less likely given the patient's history and presentation.

Explanation:
The ECG shows a narrow QRS complex with a regular rate of 51 beats per minute. This is consistent with a pacemaker-mediated rhythm. The magnet test is a simple and effective way to determine if a pacemaker is functioning properly. When a magnet is placed over a pacemaker, it inhibits the pacemaker's output and causes the heart to beat at its intrinsic rate. In this case, placing a magnet over the pulse generator would cause the heart rate to increase, which would provide evidence that the pacemaker is not functioning properly.

A transvenous pacing device is a type of pacemaker that is inserted into the heart through a vein. It is used to treat patients with bradycardia, which is a slow heart rate. Transcutaneous pacing is a type of pacing that is used to temporarily treat patients with bradycardia. It is done by placing two pads on the patient's chest and sending an electrical current through the pads to the heart. Chest radiographs are not necessary in this case because the ECG is already diagnostic.

Explanation:

The patient is an HIV-positive man with a CD4 count of less than 200 cells/mm3, which puts him at high risk for developing Kaposi sarcoma. The violaceous nodules of the base of the tongue and subglottis, as well as the subepithelial spindle cell lesion with extravasation of erythrocytes and strong staining for human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8), are all characteristic of Kaposi sarcoma. Syphilitic gumma of the larynx is a rare condition that typically presents with a single, painless mass on the vocal cord. Bacillary angiomatosis is a bacterial infection that can cause multiple, small, red-purple lesions on the skin and mucous membranes. Angiosarcoma is a rare, malignant tumor of the blood vessels that can occur anywhere in the body, but is most common in the liver.

Secretory carcinoma is a rare type of salivary gland carcinoma that is characterized by the presence of abundant bubbly secretion within microcystic spaces. This secretion is positive for periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining. The tumor cells are typically oval or rounded with fine chromatin and centrally located nucleoli. They may have papillary architecture. Secretory carcinoma is usually low-grade and has a good prognosis.

In the case presented, the patient is a 44-year-old woman with a 6-year history of an asymptomatic enlarging right parotid mass. Fine-needle aspiration showed sheets and clusters of bland polygonal epithelial cells admixed with bright pink filamentous matrix. The final pathology of the lesion showed histologic findings compatible with salivary gland carcinoma, with microcystic and papillary architecture. Abundant bubbly secretion was present within these microcystic spaces, and this material was positive for PAS staining. Immunohistochemically, there was positivity for epithelial membrane antigen, cytokeratin (CK) 7 and CK19, S100 protein, and gross cystic disease fluid protein 15 (GCDFP-15). Stains for gastrointestinal stromal tumors 1 (DOG1) and p63 were negative. The tumor appeared to be contained within the surgical excision margins. There was perineural invasion without evidence of neoplastic emboli in the peritumoral lymphovascular spaces. The patient underwent a right parotidectomy I to IV and a level II superselective neck dissection.

The clinical and pathologic features of this case are consistent with a diagnosis of secretory carcinoma. The presence of abundant bubbly secretion within microcystic spaces, which is positive for PAS staining, is a characteristic feature of this tumor. The tumor cells are typically oval or rounded with fine chromatin and centrally located nucleoli. They may have papillary architecture. Secretory carcinoma is usually low-grade and has a good prognosis.

The other answer choices are incorrect. Acinic cell carcinoma is a type of salivary gland carcinoma that is characterized by the presence of acinar cells, which are cells that produce saliva. Adenocarcinoma, not otherwise specified, is a diagnosis for a salivary gland carcinoma that does not fit into any of the other specific categories of salivary gland carcinoma. Low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a type of salivary gland carcinoma that is characterized by the presence of mucus-producing cells, squamous cells, and intermediate cells.

The patient in this case has a clinical presentation consistent with non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), a type of cancer that affects the white blood cells. NHL is a heterogeneous group of diseases, and the specific subtype of NHL that the patient has cannot be determined without further testing. However, the presence of multiple patchy, yellow choroidal lesions with obliteration of the normal choroidal vasculature throughout the entire fundus is a characteristic finding of intraocular lymphoma (IL), a rare subtype of NHL that affects the eye. IL is typically treated with systemic chemotherapy, such as rituximab. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody that targets and kills B cells, which are the white blood cells that are most commonly involved in NHL. It is given as an intravenous infusion over several hours.

The other options are not appropriate treatments for NHL. Oral corticosteroids and intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor therapy are used to treat uveitis, an inflammation of the uveal tract, which is the middle layer of the eye. Topical interferon is used to treat a variety of conditions, including chronic hepatitis C and multiple sclerosis. It is not a standard treatment for NHL.

In conclusion, the correct answer is: **D. Begin systemic intravenous rituximab.** This is the most appropriate treatment for the patient in this case because it is a specific treatment for the type of cancer that he has.

Excisional biopsy is the most appropriate next step in this case because it will allow for a definitive diagnosis of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) infection. The lesion is characteristic of VZV infection, and the patient has a history of recent exposure to VZV. However, other conditions can cause similar lesions, so it is important to obtain a definitive diagnosis. Excisional biopsy is the most accurate method of diagnosing VZV infection. It is also the most definitive treatment, as it removes the entire lesion.

Antimicrobial therapy is not indicated in this case because the lesion is not caused by a bacterial infection. Wound debridement is not indicated because the lesion is not infected and does not require removal of necrotic tissue. Computed tomography scan of the orbits is not indicated in this case because there is no evidence of orbital involvement.

Excisional biopsy is the most appropriate next step in this case. It will allow for a definitive diagnosis of VZV infection and provide the most definitive treatment.

Explanation:

The patient in this case has a rapidly progressive retinal vaso-occlusive disease. The most likely cause of this condition is a demyelinating disorder such as multiple sclerosis. Corticosteroids are the mainstay of treatment for demyelinating disorders, as they can help to reduce inflammation and protect the myelin sheaths of nerve fibers. Intraocular corticosteroid injections can also be used to treat retinal vaso-occlusive disease, but they are generally not as effective as systemic corticosteroids. Oral valacyclovir and intramuscular benzathine penicillin G are not appropriate treatments for retinal vaso-occlusive disease. Valacyclovir is an antiviral medication that is used to treat herpes zoster infections. Intramuscular benzathine penicillin G is an antibiotic that is used to treat bacterial infections. Neither of these medications would be effective in treating a demyelinating disorder.

In addition to systemic corticosteroids, the patient may also need to be treated with other medications to control her blood pressure and cholesterol levels. She may also need to undergo laser therapy to prevent further vision loss.

Explanation:

The patient's history and examination are consistent with retinitis pigmentosa, a hereditary retinal disease characterized by progressive loss of rod and cone photoreceptors. Full-field electroretinogram (ERG) is a test that measures the electrical activity of the retina in response to light. It is a useful test for diagnosing retinitis pigmentosa and monitoring the progression of the disease.

Serology testing to measure vitamins A, B1, B12, and folate is not indicated in this case. These vitamins are important for retinal function, but their levels are not typically affected in retinitis pigmentosa.

Magnetic resonance image (MRI) scan of the brain is not indicated in this case. MRI is a useful test for diagnosing central nervous system (CNS) disorders, but there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has a CNS disorder.

Fluorescein angiography is a test that uses a dye to visualize the blood vessels in the retina. It is a useful test for diagnosing and monitoring certain retinal diseases, but it is not typically used in retinitis pigmentosa.

Therefore, the next best step in the management of this patient is to obtain a full-field ERG.

Explanation: The patient has multiple brown masses at the pupillary margin in both eyes, encroaching on the central visual axis. This is concerning for iris cysts, which can be associated with systemic conditions such as von Hippel-Lindau disease. Von Hippel-Lindau disease is a rare genetic disorder that can affect multiple organ systems, including the eyes, brain, kidneys, adrenal glands, and pancreas. Patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease are at increased risk for developing cancer, particularly renal cell carcinoma.

A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is a useful test to screen for cancer in patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease. The CT scan can detect tumors in the kidneys, adrenal glands, pancreas, and other organs. If a tumor is found, further testing may be necessary to determine if it is cancerous.

Surgical iridectomy is a procedure that is used to treat iris cysts. However, surgical iridectomy is not necessary to diagnose von Hippel-Lindau disease. In addition, surgical iridectomy does not prevent the development of cancer in patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease.

Kidney ultrasonography is a useful test to screen for kidney stones and kidney tumors. However, kidney ultrasonography is not a sensitive test for detecting von Hippel-Lindau disease. In addition, kidney ultrasonography does not provide information about the location of tumors in other organs.

Positron emission tomography (PET) scan is a useful test to detect cancer. However, PET scan is not a sensitive test for detecting von Hippel-Lindau disease. In addition, PET scan does not provide information about the location of tumors in other organs.

The patient is presenting with a large right upper lobe cavitary mass that has enlarged and invaded the pleura. She has also developed hypoxemia, requiring intubation, and a right-sided tension pneumothorax. These findings are concerning for aspergillosis, a fungal infection that can be life-threatening in immunocompromised patients.

Aspergillosis is typically treated with antifungal medications, such as voriconazole. However, in patients with invasive aspergillosis, antifungal therapy alone is often not sufficient. Radiation therapy can be used to shrink the tumor and improve the response to antifungal therapy. In some cases, surgery may also be necessary to remove the infected tissue.

In this case, the patient's clinical presentation is concerning for invasive aspergillosis. She is immunocompromised due to her diabetes and poorly controlled hemoglobin A1c level. She also has a cavitary mass that has enlarged and invaded the pleura. These findings warrant a consultation with radiation oncology to discuss the role of radiation therapy in her management.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not address the patient's underlying condition of invasive aspergillosis. Answer A would change the antimicrobial therapy, but this would not address the need for radiation therapy. Answer B would change the antifungal therapy, but this would not address the need for radiation therapy. Answer D would perform right upper lobe resection, but this would not address the patient's underlying condition of invasive aspergillosis.

Explanation:

Actinic prurigo cheilitis is a chronic, pruritic, inflammatory condition of the lower lip that is associated with sun exposure. It is characterized by erythematous papules, scales, and fissures on the lower lip. The condition is more common in women and older adults. The exact cause of actinic prurigo cheilitis is unknown, but it is thought to be a reaction to ultraviolet (UV) radiation.

The diagnosis of actinic prurigo cheilitis is based on the clinical presentation and a skin biopsy. The biopsy typically shows a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate in the dermis. There is no specific treatment for actinic prurigo cheilitis. Treatment is aimed at relieving the pruritus and preventing further sun damage. Topical corticosteroids, emollients, and sunscreens are often used. In severe cases, oral corticosteroids or phototherapy may be necessary.

PCI is a minimally invasive procedure that involves inserting a balloon catheter into a narrowed or blocked artery and inflating the balloon to widen the artery. This can improve blood flow to the heart muscle and relieve symptoms of angina.

In this case, the patient has a history of myocarditis and an ejection fraction of 40%. This means that his heart muscle is not pumping blood as efficiently as it should be. This can lead to symptoms of angina, dyspnea, and fatigue.

PCI is a safe and effective treatment for patients with coronary artery disease. It can improve symptoms, reduce the risk of heart attack, and improve survival.

The other options are not as appropriate in this case.

Option B, coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), is a more invasive procedure that involves taking a blood vessel from another part of the body and using it to bypass the narrowed or blocked artery. CABG is typically reserved for patients who have more severe coronary artery disease or who have not responded well to PCI.

Option C, coronary artery reimplantation, is a surgical procedure that involves removing the narrowed or blocked artery and replacing it with a healthy artery from another part of the body. This is a very rare procedure that is only used in patients who have very severe coronary artery disease.

Option D, continue medical management, is a reasonable option for patients with mild or stable coronary artery disease. However, in this case, the patient has a history of myocarditis and an ejection fraction of 40%. This means that his heart muscle is not pumping blood as efficiently as it should be. This can lead to symptoms of angina, dyspnea, and fatigue. PCI is a safe and effective treatment for patients with coronary artery disease.

The patient's history and examination are consistent with a diagnosis of prion disease. Prions are misfolded proteins that can cause other proteins to misfold, leading to a cascade of neurodegeneration. The most common prion disease is Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which is characterized by rapidly progressive dementia, ataxia, and myoclonus. Other prion diseases include Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome, fatal familial insomnia, and Kuru.

The diagnosis of prion disease is made by testing cerebrospinal fluid for the presence of prion proteins. There is no cure for prion disease, but treatment can help to manage the symptoms.

A pars plana vitrectomy is a surgical procedure that is used to remove vitreous humor from the eye. It is not indicated in the treatment of prion disease.

Aspirin is a medication that is used to prevent blood clots. It is not indicated in the treatment of prion disease.

The patient presented with a slowly progressive unilateral blepharoptosis that had been worsening for several years. The physical examination was notable for left-sided blepharoptosis with a palpable mass of the upper eyelid laterally. Eyelid eversion examination findings showed a yellow nodular lesion along the tarsal conjunctiva. An incisional biopsy was performed. Histopathologic examination results showed amorphous acellular proteinaceous deposits that positively stained with Congo red. Polarized microscopy of the deposits showed apple-green birefringence. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of amyloidosis.

Amyloidosis is a group of diseases characterized by the deposition of amyloid, an abnormal protein, in tissues and organs. Amyloid can deposit in any organ system, but the most common sites of involvement are the kidneys, heart, liver, and nervous system. The clinical manifestations of amyloidosis vary depending on the organ systems involved.

The treatment of amyloidosis depends on the underlying cause of the disease. In some cases, treatment may be aimed at removing the amyloid deposits, such as with stem cell transplantation or liver transplantation. In other cases, treatment may be aimed at controlling the symptoms of the disease, such as with dialysis or chemotherapy.

In this case, the patient has a diagnosis of amyloidosis. The most appropriate treatment for this patient is a complete excision of the amyloid deposits. This will help to prevent further progression of the disease and improve the patient's quality of life.

The other options are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate treatment for amyloidosis. Option B, administer cryotherapy treatment, is not a standard treatment for amyloidosis. Option C, order systemic laboratory workup, is important to rule out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms, but it is not the most appropriate treatment for amyloidosis. Option D, observe, is not an appropriate treatment for amyloidosis. Amyloidosis is a progressive disease, and observation alone will not prevent further progression of the disease.

The patient has developed a bilateral retinal detachment, which is a medical emergency. The goal of treatment is to reattach the retina to the back of the eye. This can be done with a vitrectomy, which is a procedure to remove the vitreous gel from the eye, or with a scleral buckle, which is a procedure to place a band around the outside of the eye to support the retina.

Immunosuppressive therapy is not indicated in this case because the patient does not have an autoimmune disease. Monitoring for resolution of subretinal fluid is not an appropriate treatment for a retinal detachment. Surgery to create scleral windows is not a standard treatment for a retinal detachment.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each of the possible answers:

* Answer A: Initiate immunosuppressive therapy. This is not the correct answer because the patient does not have an autoimmune disease. Immunosuppressive therapy is used to treat autoimmune diseases, such as lupus or rheumatoid arthritis. In these diseases, the body's immune system attacks its own tissues, including the retina. In the patient's case, the retinal detachment is not due to an autoimmune disease.
* Answer B: Monitor for resolution of subretinal fluid. This is not the correct answer because the patient has a retinal detachment. A retinal detachment is a medical emergency that requires immediate treatment. Monitoring for resolution of subretinal fluid is not an appropriate treatment for a retinal detachment.
* Answer C: Retinal detachment repair with vitrectomy and/or scleral buckle. This is the correct answer because the patient has a retinal detachment. The goal of treatment is to reattach the retina to the back of the eye. This can be done with a vitrectomy, which is a procedure to remove the vitreous gel from the eye, or with a scleral buckle, which is a procedure to place a band around the outside of the eye to support the retina.
* Answer D: Surgery to create scleral windows. This is not the correct answer because it is not a standard treatment for a retinal detachment. Surgery to create scleral windows is used to treat a condition called macular hole, which is a hole in the macula, the part of the retina responsible for central vision. The patient does not have a macular hole, so surgery to create scleral windows would not be an appropriate treatment.

Mycosis fungoides is a rare type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that begins in the skin. It is the most common form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in adults. The disease usually starts as a small, scaly patch on the skin that slowly grows over time. The patches may be red, brown, or purple, and they may be itchy or painful. In some cases, the disease can spread to other parts of the body, such as the lymph nodes, liver, or lungs.

The diagnosis of mycosis fungoides is based on a biopsy of the skin lesion. The biopsy will show the presence of atypical lymphocytes, which are white blood cells that have abnormal features. Immunohistochemical staining will show that the atypical lymphocytes are of the CD4 type.

The treatment for mycosis fungoides depends on the stage of the disease. In early stages, the disease may be treated with topical therapy, such as corticosteroids or creams that contain psoralen and ultraviolet A light (PUVA). In more advanced stages, the disease may be treated with systemic chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or bone marrow transplantation.

The prognosis for mycosis fungoides is variable. The disease is usually indolent, meaning that it progresses slowly. However, in some cases, the disease can be aggressive and life-threatening.

The following are the reasons why mycosis fungoides is the most likely diagnosis in this case:

* The patient is a young girl, which is the typical age of onset for mycosis fungoides.
* The patient has a solitary scaly plaque on the lower extremity, which is a common presentation of mycosis fungoides.
* The biopsy of the lesion shows the presence of atypical lymphocytes, which are a characteristic finding of mycosis fungoides.
* Immunohistochemical staining shows that the atypical lymphocytes are of the CD4 type, which is a further indication of mycosis fungoides.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disorder characterized by the accumulation of Langerhans cells in the skin, bone, and other organs. It is most common in children. The clinical presentation of Langerhans cell histiocytosis is variable, but it typically includes skin lesions, bone pain, and fever. The diagnosis is made based on a biopsy of the affected tissue. The treatment for Langerhans cell histiocytosis depends on the extent of the disease. In mild cases, the disease may be treated with topical therapy or oral corticosteroids. In more severe cases, the disease may be treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
* Lymphomatoid contact dermatitis is a rare type of dermatitis that is characterized by an eczematous eruption and the presence of atypical lymphocytes in the skin. It is most common in adults. The clinical presentation of lymphomatoid contact dermatitis is variable, but it typically includes an eczematous eruption on the hands or feet. The diagnosis is made based on a biopsy of the affected skin. The treatment for lymphomatoid contact dermatitis depends on the severity of the disease. In mild cases, the disease may be treated with topical corticosteroids. In more severe cases, the disease may be treated with systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressive therapy.
* Pagetoid reticulosis is a rare type of lymphoma that is characterized by the accumulation of atypical lymphocytes in the skin. It is most common in older adults. The clinical presentation of Pagetoid reticulosis is variable, but it typically includes a scaly, erythematous rash on the sun-exposed areas of the skin. The diagnosis is made based on a biopsy of the affected skin. The treatment for Pagetoid reticulosis depends on the stage of the disease. In early stages, the disease may be treated with topical therapy or PUVA. In more advanced stages, the disease may be treated with systemic chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

Explanation:

Segmental incontinentia pigmenti (SIP) is a rare, congenital skin disorder that is characterized by streaks of hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation on the skin. The lesions are usually unilateral and follow the lines of Blaschko. SIP is caused by a mutation in the NEMO gene, which is involved in the regulation of the immune system.

The patient in the case presentation presents with an asymptomatic hyperpigmentation on the right side of the trunk, right upper arm, and right leg, strictly following the lines of Blaschko. A slight atrophy of the hyperpigmented skin was palpable without any signs of induration. These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of SIP.

The other possible diagnoses are epidermal nevus, linear atrophoderma of Moulin, and lichen striatus. Epidermal nevus is a congenital skin lesion that is characterized by a localized area of hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation. Linear atrophoderma of Moulin is a rare, congenital skin disorder that is characterized by linear streaks of atrophic skin. Lichen striatus is a chronic, inflammatory skin disorder that is characterized by linear streaks of erythema and scaling.

The patient in the case presentation does not have any of the characteristic features of epidermal nevus, linear atrophoderma of Moulin, or lichen striatus. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is SIP.

Explanation:

The patient in the case has a 4-month history of new-onset persistent facial eruption. He denied a history of facial flushing. The patient was initially treated for rosacea at an outside hospital with topical 1% metronidazole cream for 1 month without improvement and developed acute facial purpura after 1 day of treatment with oral doxycycline, which was discontinued. Because of the eruption’s rapid onset and violaceous appearance, as well as empirical treatment failure, the patient was referred for further evaluation. On examination, the patient had asymmetric, centrofacial, erythematous-violaceous indurated telangiectatic and ecchymotic plaques over a phymatous background. A series of punch biopsies were performed.

The histopathologic image shows ectatic vessels with plump endothelia involving the deep dermis and hypodermis. On higher magnification, ectatic vascular channels were lined by atypical plump endothelial cells. Immunohistochemistry was negative for Human herpesvirus 8.

The most likely diagnosis is rosacea-like angiosarcoma. Rosacea-like angiosarcoma is a rare, aggressive form of angiosarcoma that typically presents in the head and neck region of elderly men. It is characterized by a violaceous, indurated plaque with telangiectasias and ecchymosis. The histopathologic features of rosacea-like angiosarcoma include ectatic vessels with plump endothelia, atypical plump endothelial cells, and a lack of Human herpesvirus 8 infection.

Kaposi sarcoma is a vascular neoplasm that is typically associated with Human herpesvirus 8 infection. It is characterized by purplish-brown macules, papules, and nodules that typically occur on the lower extremities. The histopathologic features of Kaposi sarcoma include spindle-shaped cells with plump nuclei and a storiform pattern.

Elder abuse is a form of maltreatment that occurs in older adults. It can include physical abuse, emotional abuse, financial abuse, neglect, and sexual abuse. The clinical presentation of elder abuse is variable and can include bruises, fractures, lacerations, malnutrition, dehydration, and poor hygiene.

Telangiectatic metastatic carcinoma is a rare form of metastatic carcinoma that typically presents with telangiectatic lesions on the skin. The most common primary tumors associated with telangiectatic metastatic carcinoma are breast carcinoma, lung carcinoma, and prostate carcinoma. The histopathologic features of telangiectatic metastatic carcinoma include ectatic vessels with plump endothelia and metastatic carcinoma cells.

PERM is a rare, progressive neurological disorder characterized by muscle rigidity, myoclonus, and ataxia. It is most commonly diagnosed in adults, but can also occur in children. The exact cause of PERM is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder.

The symptoms of PERM typically begin gradually and worsen over time. The most common symptoms are muscle rigidity, myoclonus, and ataxia. Muscle rigidity is characterized by stiffness and tightness of the muscles. Myoclonus is characterized by sudden, involuntary muscle jerks. Ataxia is characterized by loss of coordination and balance.

There is no cure for PERM, but there are treatments that can help to manage the symptoms. Treatment typically involves a combination of medications, physical therapy, and occupational therapy.

The patient in the case presented with a 3-week history of worsening spasms in her axial and lower limb muscles and new-onset urinary retention. Sudden episodes of painful involuntary spasms first appeared in her abdominal muscles 2 weeks after a cold. Soon after, spasms spread to all of her axial muscles and both lower limbs. These paroxysmal episodes lasted a few seconds, occurred up to 20 times a day, and were exacerbated by external stimuli. There was no impairment of consciousness during the attacks. A review of her previous records revealed a diagnosis of Hashimoto thyroiditis 1 month earlier. She had no history of tobacco, alcohol, or drug use.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of PERM. The sudden onset of painful involuntary spasms, which spread to all of her axial muscles and both lower limbs, is characteristic of PERM. The fact that the spasms were exacerbated by external stimuli and that there was no impairment of consciousness during the attacks also supports a diagnosis of PERM.

The patient's history of Hashimoto thyroiditis is also relevant. Hashimoto thyroiditis is an autoimmune disorder that can cause inflammation of the thyroid gland. It is possible that the patient's PERM is related to her Hashimoto thyroiditis.

The other possible diagnoses are not as likely. Progressive myoclonic epilepsies (PMEs) are a group of disorders characterized by progressive myoclonus, seizures, and ataxia. PMEs typically begin in childhood or adolescence. The patient in the case is an adult, so PMEs are less likely.

Faciobrachial dystonic seizures (FBDS) are a rare type of seizure that is characterized by involuntary contractions of the muscles of the face, arms, and hands. FBDS typically begin in childhood or adolescence. The patient in the case is an adult, so FBDS are less likely.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) is a rare, rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by dementia, myoclonus, and ataxia. CJD is typically diagnosed in adults. The patient in the case is an adult, but her symptoms are not typical of CJD.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for the patient in the case is PERM.

Explanation:
The patient in the case presented with a 7-month history of multiple painful erythematous plaques on her lower legs. The lesions appeared as erythematous nodules on the left leg with tenderness and pruritus and rapidly progressed to both legs. Marked lower-leg edema was noted 20 days prior to the visit. She also had an intermittent fever during the past 3 months that did not respond to antibiotic therapy. The patient’s medical history was unremarkable.

Physical examination revealed ill-defined, indurated erythematous-violaceous plaques on the lower extremities with substantial edema. Complete blood cell count revealed a normal white blood cell count with moderate anemia (hemoglobin level, 87 g/L; normal range 115-150 g/L). Additional laboratory tests demonstrated an elevated level of serum lactate dehydrogenase (749 U/L; normal range 100-240 U/L) (to convert to μkat/L, multiply by 0.0167). Quantification of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA in sera showed a high viral load of EBV in peripheral blood (1 800 000 copies/mL, normal range <500 copies/mL). A skin biopsy specimen was obtained from a violaceous plaque.

The skin biopsy specimen revealed dilated vessels filled with atypical large lymphoid cells throughout the dermis. This finding is consistent with a diagnosis of intravascular large B-cell lymphoma.

Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma is a rare, aggressive lymphoma that typically affects older adults. It is characterized by the presence of large, atypical B cells within the lumen of blood vessels. The disease can present with a variety of symptoms, including fever, weight loss, fatigue, and skin lesions. The diagnosis is made based on a biopsy of a skin lesion or other involved tissue. Treatment typically involves chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

The other possible diagnoses in this case are not as likely. Erysipelas is a bacterial infection of the skin that typically presents with a well-demarcated, erythematous plaque. Intravascular natural killer/T-cell lymphoma is a rare lymphoma that typically affects young adults. Cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis is a vasculitis that affects the small blood vessels in the skin.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis in this case is intravascular large B-cell lymphoma. This diagnosis is supported by the patient's history, physical examination, laboratory findings, and skin biopsy results.

Explanation:
The patient in this case has a number of risk factors for aortic dissection, including a history of aortic regurgitation, a dilated aortic root, and recent chest pain. A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is the most accurate test for diagnosing aortic dissection, and it is the best way to assess the extent of the dissection and the presence of any complications. A TEE can also be used to guide treatment, such as the placement of an aortic stent.

A blood culture is not necessary in this case, as the patient does not have any signs or symptoms of infection. Cardiac catheterization is not necessary to diagnose aortic dissection, and it is not the best way to assess the extent of the dissection or the presence of any complications. A repeat non-ECG-gated computed tomography angiography (CTA) is not necessary, as the previous CTA was not diagnostic.

Therefore, the best next step in the management of this patient is to perform a TEE.

Bilateral nonocclusive dural venous sinus thromboses (DVST) is a rare condition that can lead to severe vision loss. The most common treatment for DVST is to place a drain or shunt in the affected sinus to relieve the pressure on the brain. This can help to prevent further vision loss and improve the patient's overall prognosis.

Intravenous anticoagulation is not typically used to treat DVST, as it can increase the risk of bleeding. Serial lumbar punctures may be used to relieve the pressure on the brain, but they are not as effective as a drain or shunt. Immediate optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF) is a surgical procedure that can be used to relieve pressure on the optic nerves, but it is not as effective as a drain or shunt in treating DVST.

Therefore, the best course of treatment for this patient is to consult neurosurgery for consideration of drain or shunt placement.

Explanation: The patient has a large lesion of the right greater wing of the sphenoid bone extending toward the orbital apex with edema and enhancement of the right temporal lobe of the brain. This is a concerning finding that could be due to a number of different conditions, including infection, neoplasm, or inflammatory disease. The next step in management is to obtain a tissue diagnosis to determine the underlying cause of the lesion. This can be done by performing a biopsy of the lesion. A biopsy is a procedure in which a small piece of tissue is removed from the body and examined under a microscope to determine the presence of disease. In this case, a biopsy would allow the physician to determine whether the lesion is benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous). It would also allow the physician to determine the specific type of neoplasm or inflammatory disease that is present, which would guide further treatment.

Starting treatment with intravenous antibiotics or intravenous corticosteroids before obtaining a tissue diagnosis is not appropriate. Antibiotics are only indicated for infections, and corticosteroids can mask the symptoms of an underlying disease. In this case, it is important to obtain a tissue diagnosis before starting any treatment to ensure that the patient receives the most appropriate care.

Giant condyloma acuminatum is a rare, sexually transmitted disease that is characterized by a large, cauliflower-like growth on the genitals or perianal area. It is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), and is most common in people who are immunocompromised.

The patient in the case presented with a 5 × 7-cm verrucous, exophytic tumor with scant yellow drainage on the right medial buttock extending to the perianal skin. This is consistent with the clinical presentation of giant condyloma acuminatum. The patient also has a history of genital herpes simplex virus (HSV), which is a risk factor for HPV infection.

The biopsy results showed a hyperplastic epidermis with ulceration, necrosis, and a very dense inflammatory infiltrate. This is also consistent with giant condyloma acuminatum. The infiltrate was composed of plasma cells, which is a characteristic finding in this condition.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that can occur anywhere on the body, including the perianal area. However, it is not typically associated with a history of genital herpes simplex virus (HSV).
* CD30-positive primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a rare type of lymphoma that can occur anywhere on the skin. It is not typically associated with a history of genital herpes simplex virus (HSV).
* Herpes vegetans is a rare, chronic, recurrent dermatosis characterized by multiple, painful, verrucous lesions on the genital and perianal regions. It is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). However, the patient in the case does not have a history of genital warts.

Therefore, the diagnosis is giant condyloma acuminatum (Buschke-Löwenstein tumor).

The patient is a woman in her 50s who presented with scaly erythematous patches and plaques covering 10% of her total body surface area without clinically appreciable lymphadenopathy. Histopathological testing demonstrated an epidermotropic infiltrate of hyperchromatic, convoluted, atypical CD3+, CD4−, and CD8+ lymphocytes with haloed nuclei with basilar tagging and papillary dermal fibrosis. Studies of T-cell gene rearrangements identified a clonal population. Blood-flow cytometry did not reveal aberrant T-cell immunophenotypes. She was treated initially with topical and intralesional corticosteroids and narrow band UV B phototherapy. Oral bexarotene was subsequently added for recalcitrant disease. Within 2 months, she developed isolated, painful tumors. A second biopsy was performed, which was notable for an epidermotropic infiltrate of CD3+, CD4−, and CD8− weak lymphocytes, which were positive for TIA-1, granzymes, and B factor (Bf) 1 and negative for CD30 and CD56. The results of flow cytometry and imaging were unremarkable. After an initial favorable response with chlorambucil, she developed expanding ulcerated tumors complicated by a polymicrobial superinfection. Chlorambucil was discontinued in favor of antimicrobial treatment. She then received liposomal doxorubicin, although skin involvement continued to progress rapidly, with ulcerating tumors making up as much as 80% of her total body surface area. She was hospitalized for worsening disease and pain. Repeated histopathologic analysis was done.

The clinical presentation and histopathologic findings are consistent with primary cutaneous aggressive epidermotropic cytotoxic CD8+ T-cell lymphoma. This is a rare, aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that typically affects older adults. It is characterized by an epidermotropic infiltrate of CD8+ lymphocytes with haloed nuclei. The disease is often refractory to treatment and has a poor prognosis.

The other options are incorrect. CD8+ mycosis fungoides is a chronic, indolent form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Lymphomatoid papulosis, type D is a rare, benign condition that is characterized by recurrent papules and plaques. Natural killer/T-cell lymphoma is a rare, aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that typically affects young adults.

Angiosarcoma is a rare, malignant tumor of blood vessels. It can occur in any part of the body, but is most common in the skin, soft tissues, and liver. The most common symptom of angiosarcoma is a rapidly growing lump or mass. Other symptoms may include bleeding, pain, and swelling.

The diagnosis of angiosarcoma is made based on a biopsy of the tumor. The treatment of angiosarcoma depends on the size and location of the tumor, the patient's age and overall health, and the stage of the cancer. Treatment options may include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

The patient in the case presented with a 6-week history of an enlarging, tender, pruritic, 4-cm erythematous patch with central inflammatory papules distributed on the medial forehead. No inciting events, such as arthropod bite or trauma, were noted. She was initially treated for presumed shingles with valacyclovir, cephalexin, gabapentin, and hydrocortisone 2.5% topical ointment with no improvement in appearance or symptoms. No other cutaneous abnormalities were noted. A punch biopsy specimen of the left medial forehead was obtained, and histological and immunohistochemical analyses were performed. Histopathological results revealed dissecting vascular channels (black arrowheads) and spindle cells (white arrowheads) (hematoxylin-eosin). Immunohistochemical staining revealed CD31 and diffuse expression of FLI-1 and ERG in the vascular and spindle cell components.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of angiosarcoma. Angiosarcoma is a rare, malignant tumor of blood vessels. It can occur in any part of the body, but is most common in the skin, soft tissues, and liver. The most common symptom of angiosarcoma is a rapidly growing lump or mass.

The patient is presenting with syncope, left calf tightness and pain, shortness of breath, and a syncopal event. These symptoms are concerning for a pulmonary embolism. A pulmonary embolism is a blockage of the pulmonary artery or one of its branches by a blood clot. The most common cause of a pulmonary embolism is deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which is a blood clot that forms in a deep vein, usually in the leg.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a pulmonary embolism. The patient's laboratory results are also consistent with a pulmonary embolism, with a troponin level of 0.07 ng/mL and a fibrin D-dimer level of more than 2000 μg/mL. The patient's electrocardiogram on presentation showed sinus tachycardia and was otherwise normal. Computed tomography of the chest showed multiple large bilateral pulmonary emboli, with deviation of the interventricular septum toward the left ventricle. Echocardiography demonstrated a large mobile thrombus extending from the right atrium into the right ventricle, as well as a clot in the left atrium and left ventricle that appeared to originate from the interatrial septum, suggesting a defect there.

The patient's presentation and findings are consistent with a massive pulmonary embolism. A massive pulmonary embolism is a pulmonary embolism that is large enough to cause hemodynamic instability, which can lead to death. The patient's hemodynamic instability is evidenced by her syncope.

The treatment for a massive pulmonary embolism is systemic thrombolysis. Systemic thrombolysis is the administration of a thrombolytic agent, such as alteplase or reteplase, to dissolve the blood clot. Systemic thrombolysis is a life-saving treatment for a massive pulmonary embolism. It can improve hemodynamic stability and reduce the risk of death.

The patient should be admitted to the intensive care unit for close monitoring and treatment. The patient should also be started on intravenous unfractionated heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin to prevent further clot formation. The patient may also need to be anticoagulated with warfarin for long-term prevention of recurrent pulmonary embolism.

The other options are not appropriate for this patient. Option A, start intravenous unfractionated heparin, is not an appropriate treatment for a massive pulmonary embolism. Intravenous unfractionated heparin is a blood thinner that can be used to prevent further clot formation, but it is not effective at dissolving a blood clot. Option B, consult interventional radiology for catheter-directed thrombolysis, is a possible treatment option for a massive pulmonary embolism. However, it is not always available and it is not without risks. Option C, consult cardiothoracic surgery for controlled operative thrombectomy, is a possible treatment option for a massive pulmonary embolism. However, it is a major surgery and it is not without risks.

Explanation:

The patient has a history of severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), which is a condition that occurs when the muscles in the back of the throat relax and block the airway during sleep. This can lead to snoring, gasping for air, and waking up frequently during the night. OSA is often associated with macroglossia, which is an enlargement of the tongue. Macroglossia can narrow the airway and make it more difficult to breathe.

The patient also has a history of growth in his tongue and feet. This is a classic sign of acromegaly, which is a condition that occurs when the pituitary gland produces too much growth hormone. Acromegaly can cause a number of symptoms, including enlargement of the hands and feet, enlargement of the face, and changes in the voice.

The patient's clinical presentation, including his history of OSA, macroglossia, and growth in his tongue and feet, is consistent with a diagnosis of acromegaly. The other options are not as likely in this case. Allergic rhinitis is a condition that causes inflammation of the nasal passages. It is not typically associated with OSA or macroglossia. Lymphoma is a type of cancer that can affect the lymph nodes. It is not typically associated with OSA or macroglossia. Normal anatomic variant is not a diagnosis that is typically used to describe the patient's presentation.

Explanation:

Rosai-Dorfman disease is a rare, non-neoplastic, benign disorder of unknown cause characterized by proliferation of histiocytes and lymphocytes in lymph nodes, bone marrow, and other organs. It is typically seen in children and young adults, with a male predominance. The most common presentation is a painless, enlarging lymph node in the neck, followed by fever, malaise, and weight loss. The diagnosis is made by biopsy of an affected lymph node. Treatment is usually not necessary, but some patients may require chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

The patient in the case presented with a 6-month history of a left-sided neck mass that was initially treated with antibiotics but persisted. He also developed a sore throat and fever. Imaging studies showed an enlarged, homogenously enhancing left-neck level 2B lymph node. Laboratory tests showed an elevated white blood cell count and C-reactive protein level. Fine-needle aspiration and flow cytometry were negative for lymphoproliferative disorders or a malignant condition. A tissue culture was also negative. Given the inconclusive diagnosis, the patient underwent a left neck dissection of levels 2A, 2B, and 5A. Intraoperative frozen sections did not show a malignant process. On final analysis, a pathologic examination of the largest lymph node showed a regressed germinal center penetrated by a hyalinized vessel and small lymphocytes in mantle zone palisading around the residual germinal centers. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of Rosai-Dorfman disease.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease is a self-limiting, lymphadenopathic disorder that is typically seen in young adults. It is characterized by the presence of a necrotizing lymphadenitis with abundant histiocytes and lymphocytes.
* Dianzani autoimmune lymphoproliferative disease is a rare, autoimmune disorder that is characterized by the presence of circulating polyclonal B cells and lymphadenopathy.
* Castleman disease is a rare, lymphoproliferative disorder that is characterized by the presence of giant lymph nodes.

The patient is a 65-year-old white woman with stage IV breast cancer with metastases to the lungs and liver. She presented with a new onset of what she called “multiple green spots” in both eyes for 3 days. The spots were stationary; she denied any floaters or photopsias. The onset was simultaneous in both eyes, with no associated eye pain or photophobia. There was no ocular history, and a recent comprehensive eye examination had normal results. Her visual acuity was 20/20 OU. An anterior segment examination had unremarkable results. There was no vitritis, and her optic nerves were pink and sharp. A dilated fundus examination revealed multifocal, hypopigmented, cream-colored spots scattered throughout the posterior pole in both eyes. These spots were hyperautofluorescent on fundus autofluorescence and localized to the subretinal space. Notably, 2 weeks prior to presentation, she had started taking cobimetinib therapy as part of a clinical trial for her breast cancer.

Cobimetinib is a small molecule inhibitor of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. It is approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer. The most common side effects of cobimetinib are rash, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Less common side effects include fatigue, muscle cramps, and arthralgia.

The patient's presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of cobimetinib-induced maculopathy. This is a rare, but well-described side effect of cobimetinib therapy. The macula is the part of the retina that is responsible for central vision. Cobimetinib-induced maculopathy is characterized by the development of subretinal fluid and pigmentary changes in the macula. The severity of the maculopathy can vary from patient to patient. Some patients may have only mild visual symptoms, while others may experience significant visual loss.

There is no specific treatment for cobimetinib-induced maculopathy. Treatment is aimed at managing the symptoms and preventing further vision loss. This may include the use of topical steroids, anti-inflammatory agents, and laser therapy. In some cases, it may be necessary to discontinue cobimetinib therapy.

In the patient's case, the best course of action is to elect observation. The patient is only 3 days into her cobimetinib therapy, and the maculopathy is likely to be mild at this stage. There is no need to initiate treatment with steroids or other medications at this time. The patient should be monitored closely for signs of progression of the maculopathy. If the maculopathy does progress, then treatment may be necessary. However, it is important to weigh the risks and benefits of treatment before making a decision.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Option A, initiating an oral prednisone course, is not necessary at this time. Option B, ordering a positron emission tomography scan, is not necessary to diagnose cobimetinib-induced maculopathy. Option C, discontinuing breast cancer treatment, is not necessary unless the maculopathy is severe and is not responding to treatment.

 26%|██▌       | 400/1525 [1:32:45<4:28:43, 14.33s/it]The correct answer is: A. Stop all psychiatric medications.

The patient has a history of recent psychiatric medication overdose, and the maculopathy is consistent with a drug-induced maculopathy. Stopping the medications is the most important step in treating this condition.

An electroretinogram (ERG) is a test that measures the electrical activity of the retina. It can be used to diagnose a variety of retinal diseases, including drug-induced maculopathy. However, it is not necessary to obtain an ERG before stopping the medications.

Inquiring about bright light exposures is important in the diagnosis of certain types of maculopathy, such as solar retinopathy. However, the patient's history and examination findings are not consistent with solar retinopathy.

Prescribing oral steroids is not appropriate in this case. Steroids can be used to treat some types of maculopathy, but they are not effective in treating drug-induced maculopathy.

In conclusion, the best course of action is to stop all psychiatric medications. This will help to protect the patient's vision and may even lead to improvement in the maculopathy.

The patient has acute-onset visual acuity loss in the right eye of 2 days’ duration associated with right periorbital pain. His medical history is remarkable for diabetes mellitus of 40 years’ duration complicated by end-stage renal disease requiring a renal transplant and ongoing immunosuppression. His visual acuity is no light perception OD and 20/40 OS. The right eye exhibits an amaurotic pupil, severe generalized restriction of extraocular movement, and ptosis with poor levator function. His intraocular pressures are normal. At a base of 104 mm, exophthalmometer measurements are 24 mm OD and 20 mm OS. The results of a slitlamp examination were noncontributory in both eyes. A dilated fundus examination revealed a pale optic disc in the right eye and panretinal laser scars in both eyes. Cranial nerves V and VII-XII were intact bilaterally. The patient was afebrile, with vital signs within normal limits. His leukocyte count was 2200 cells/μL.

Noncontrast computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging of the orbit demonstrated highly attenuating debris and bony irregularities throughout the paranasal sinuses and fat stranding in the right orbital apex. Magnetic resonance venography of the head had unremarkable results. Results of a sinus biopsy by the otolaryngology service demonstrated fungal hyphal elements. Systemic therapy was initiated, and the otolaryngology service planned urgent surgical nasosinal debridement. Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging was withheld pending stabilization in the patient’s renal status.

The patient's presentation is consistent with fungal orbital infection, also known as rhino-orbital mucormycosis. This is a rare but serious infection that can cause significant morbidity and mortality. The most common predisposing factors are diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression, and hematologic malignancies. The infection typically begins in the paranasal sinuses and then spreads to the orbit via the ethmoid sinuses. The most common clinical features are periorbital pain, swelling, and erythema. Visual loss may occur due to optic nerve compression or inflammation. Other possible complications include meningitis, cavernous sinus thrombosis, and brain abscess.

The treatment of fungal orbital infection is urgent surgical debridement of the infected tissue. This is followed by systemic antifungal therapy. The prognosis depends on the extent of the infection and the patient's underlying medical condition. In general, early diagnosis and treatment can lead to good outcomes.

In this case, the patient has a history of diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease. He also has acute-onset visual acuity loss in the right eye, periorbital pain, and amaurotic pupil. These findings are consistent with fungal orbital infection. The patient's medical history and imaging studies confirm the diagnosis.

The next step in the patient's management is urgent surgical debridement of the infected tissue. This will be followed by systemic antifungal therapy. The patient's prognosis depends on the extent of the infection and his underlying medical condition. However, early diagnosis and treatment can lead to good outcomes.

The other options are not appropriate for this patient. Option A (await improvement in renal status and perform contrast-enhanced imaging) would delay the diagnosis and treatment of the infection. Option B (perform transcutaneous retrobulbar injection of an antifungal agent) is not a standard treatment for fungal orbital infection. Option C (perform orbital exenteration) is a radical surgery that is only indicated for patients with extensive disease that is not responsive to other treatments.

Explanation:

Erosive adenomatosis of the nipple (EAN) is a rare, benign condition that is characterized by a translucent, slightly eroded, nipple lesion. It is most commonly seen in middle-aged and elderly women, but it can also occur in men. The cause of EAN is unknown, but it is thought to be a hormonally mediated condition.

The diagnosis of EAN is made based on the clinical presentation and a dermoscopic examination. A biopsy is usually not necessary, but it can be performed to rule out other conditions, such as Paget disease of the breast.

Treatment for EAN is not always necessary. However, if the lesion is symptomatic or cosmetically unacceptable, it can be treated with topical steroids or surgery.

The other options are incorrect because:

* Basal cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that is most commonly seen on the face and neck. It is usually a small, raised lesion with a central ulcer.
* Amelanotic melanoma is a type of skin cancer that does not have the pigment melanin. It is often mistaken for a basal cell carcinoma or a seborrheic keratosis.
* Ductal adenocarcinoma of the breast is a type of breast cancer that starts in the ducts of the breast. It is the most common type of breast cancer.
* Erosive adenomatosis of the nipple is a rare, benign condition that is characterized by a translucent, slightly eroded, nipple lesion.

Pulmonary tumor thrombotic microangiopathy (PTM) is a rare, life-threatening complication of cancer that occurs when cancer cells release tumor microparticles into the bloodstream. These microparticles can then lodge in the small blood vessels of the lungs, causing them to become inflamed and blocked. This can lead to shortness of breath, chest pain, and other symptoms.

PTM is most commonly associated with lung cancer, but it can also occur with other types of cancer, such as breast cancer, colon cancer, and ovarian cancer. The risk of developing PTM increases with the stage of cancer and the presence of metastatic disease.

There is no cure for PTM, but there are treatments that can help to control the symptoms and improve the quality of life for patients. Treatment options include blood transfusions, plasma exchange, and chemotherapy.

In the case of the patient in the question, the most likely diagnosis is PTM. This is supported by the patient's history of lung adenocarcinoma, the presence of bilateral ground-glass opacities and right basilar consolidations on chest CT, and the finding of Paget cells in the lung tissue at autopsy.

Left ventricular systolic dysfunction is a condition in which the left ventricle of the heart is unable to pump blood effectively. This can lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, and fatigue. However, left ventricular systolic dysfunction is not a likely diagnosis in this case, as the patient's echocardiogram showed normal left ventricular function.

Sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect multiple organs in the body, including the lungs. However, sarcoidosis is not a likely diagnosis in this case, as the patient did not have any of the classic symptoms of sarcoidosis, such as fever, fatigue, and weight loss.

Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is a condition in which the small blood vessels in the lungs become blocked by blood clots. This can lead to symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, and fatigue. However, CTEPH is not a likely diagnosis in this case, as the patient did not have any evidence of thromboembolism on her chest CT.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is PTM.

The patient has a large circumferential pericardial effusion, diastolic right ventricular collapse, and exaggerated respiratory variation (>25%) in the mitral inflow velocity but a normal inferior vena cava size. These findings are consistent with cardiac tamponade, which is a life-threatening condition that requires immediate treatment.

Pericardiocentesis with pericardial drain placement is a temporizing measure that can be used to relieve the pressure of the pericardial effusion and improve hemodynamics. However, it is not a definitive treatment for cardiac tamponade, as the effusion will recur if the underlying cause is not addressed.

Urgent vascular surgery referral for IVC stent removal is the definitive treatment for cardiac tamponade caused by an IVC stent. The stent is compressing the IVC, which is preventing blood from returning to the heart. Removing the stent will relieve the compression and allow blood to flow normally again.

Initiation of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and colchicine and observation is not appropriate treatment for cardiac tamponade. These medications can be used to treat pericarditis, which is an inflammation of the pericardium. However, they will not relieve the pressure of the pericardial effusion and improve hemodynamics.

Therefore, the correct answer is: C. Urgent vascular surgery referral for IVC stent removal.

IgG4-related disease is a systemic disorder characterized by the deposition of IgG4-positive plasma cells and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate in various organs. It can affect the larynx, causing symptoms such as odynophagia, hoarseness, and dysphagia. The diagnosis is made based on clinical presentation, imaging findings, and laboratory tests. Treatment is typically with steroids.

The other options are incorrect. Laryngeal tuberculosis is a rare but serious infection that can cause symptoms similar to those of IgG4-related disease. However, it is more likely to cause fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease that can affect the larynx, but it is more likely to cause symptoms such as joint pain, fatigue, and rash. Churg-Strauss syndrome is a rare vasculitis that can affect the larynx, but it is more likely to cause symptoms such as asthma, fever, and weight loss.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each option:

* A: Laryngeal tuberculosis is a rare but serious infection that can cause symptoms similar to those of IgG4-related disease. However, it is more likely to cause fever, night sweats, and weight loss. The patient in this case did not have any of these symptoms.
* B: Systemic lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease that can affect the larynx, but it is more likely to cause symptoms such as joint pain, fatigue, and rash. The patient in this case did not have any of these symptoms.
* C: IgG4-related disease is a systemic disorder characterized by the deposition of IgG4-positive plasma cells and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate in various organs. It can affect the larynx, causing symptoms such as odynophagia, hoarseness, and dysphagia. The diagnosis is made based on clinical presentation, imaging findings, and laboratory tests. Treatment is typically with steroids. The patient in this case had all of the classic symptoms of IgG4-related disease, and the diagnosis was confirmed by biopsy.
* D: Churg-Strauss syndrome is a rare vasculitis that can affect the larynx, but it is more likely to cause symptoms such as asthma, fever, and weight loss. The patient in this case did not have any of these symptoms.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for the patient in this case is IgG4-related disease.

Explanation:
The patient is a 31-year-old female who presented with right nasal pain and radiating facial pain over the previous 3 years. She reported feeling a mass in her right nostril that had not changed in size, as well as associated nasal tenderness to the external nose, worsening pain with exposure to cold temperatures, and frequent sneezing. Prior to presentation, she had been prescribed fluticasone and loratadine for allergic rhinitis without resolution of symptoms. She denied difficulty breathing, epistaxis, rhinorrhea, fever, chills, weight loss, or night sweats. She was a nonsmoker and nondrinker.

On physical examination, her external nose had no visible lesions. A rhinoscopy revealed normal mucosa with a submucosal, round, firm, tender lesion, measuring approximately 1 cm and located on the right anterior nasal septum. No drainage was visualized. Her turbinates appeared normal. The patient underwent surgical excision of the septal lesion under general anesthesia for definitive diagnosis. The specimen measured 1.1 × 0.7 × 0.2 cm and was erythematous, soft, vascular, and adherent, with a broad base to the anterior superior nasal septal mucosa just inferior to the upper lateral cartilage. The lesion was excised down through the perichondrium.

The most likely diagnosis is glomus tumor. Glomus tumors are rare, benign tumors that arise from the glomus bodies, which are small, specialized paraganglia that are found in the head and neck. They are most commonly found in the middle ear, but can also occur in the nose, paranasal sinuses, orbit, and soft tissues of the head and neck. Glomus tumors are typically slow-growing and painless, but can cause symptoms such as pain, hearing loss, tinnitus, and facial flushing. Treatment is surgical excision.

Inverted papilloma is another possibility, but it is more likely to occur in older adults and is usually not associated with pain. Hemangiopericytoma is a rare, malignant tumor of the blood vessels that can occur anywhere in the body, but is most common in the extremities. Paraganglioma is a rare, benign tumor that arises from the paraganglia, which are small, specialized neuroendocrine organs that are found throughout the body. Paragangliomas can occur in any location where paraganglia are found, but are most common in the adrenal glands, carotid body, and jugular foramen.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is glomus tumor.

Explanation:

Rhinoscleroma is a chronic granulomatous disease caused by Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis. It is characterized by the formation of nasal polyps, subglottic stenosis, and obstructive pulmonary disease. The disease is most common in Central and South America, Eastern Europe, and Africa.

The patient in the case presented with a history of nasal congestion and dysphonia for 2 years. He also had a history of asthma, which is a common comorbidity of rhinoscleroma. On physical examination, the patient had large, bilateral obstructive nasal polyps. Flexible laryngoscopy revealed smooth, lobulated masses involving the epiglottis and right aryepiglottic fold. The epiglottic component extended inferiorly along the petiole, involving and obstructing the anterior glottis. The vocal fold mucosa was thickened, but bilateral mobility was intact with an adequate posterior glottic airway.

Computed tomography demonstrated homogenous, isodense, laryngeal lesions that correlated with the previously mentioned laryngoscopy findings, but also showed subglottic stenosis approximately 2 cm in length secondary to the thickened intraluminal soft tissue. The cartilaginous laryngotracheal framework was preserved. The chest radiograph was unremarkable.

The patient was taken to the operating room for direct laryngoscopy with endoscopic airway dilation and laryngeal mass biopsy. The biopsy results showed vacuolated macrophages with bacilli and eosinophilic inclusions within plasma cells. These findings are characteristic of rhinoscleroma.

Amyloidosis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and sarcoidosis are all granulomatous diseases, but they do not typically involve the larynx. Amyloidosis is a disease characterized by the deposition of amyloid, an abnormal protein, in various organs and tissues. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a vasculitis that affects small and medium-sized arteries. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease characterized by the formation of noncaseating granulomas in various organs and tissues.

In conclusion, the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of rhinoscleroma.

Explanation:

The patient is a healthy woman in her 60s who presented with a diffuse palatal swelling of unknown duration. The extraoral examination results were within normal limits, with no evidence of swelling, expansion, trismus, or lymphadenopathy. Intraoral examination revealed a focally ulcerated, fluctuant 2.5 × 2 × 1-cm pink-red submucosal swelling in the right palatal mucosa. The lesion involved almost the entire right side of the hard palatal mucosa and soft palate and terminated at the palatal midline. Imaging studies were unremarkable.

An incisional biopsy of the lesion was performed and showed fibrous connective tissues infiltrated by inflammatory cells arranged in a diffuse, sheetlike pattern. The cells were large with a moderate amount of cytoplasm and appeared to be round to oval vesicular nuclei with vesicular chromatin and 2 to 3 small nucleoli. The cells stained positively with CD45, CD20, CD79, CD21, BCL6, and BCL2 antibodies.

Based on the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and biopsy results, the most likely diagnosis is diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that accounts for approximately 30% of all cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is a B-cell lymphoma, which means that it originates from B-cells, a type of white blood cell. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is a relatively aggressive lymphoma, but it is often treatable with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Pleomorphic adenoma is a benign tumor that most commonly occurs in the salivary glands. It is not typically associated with a diffuse palatal swelling.
* Angioleiomyoma is a benign tumor that most commonly occurs in the skin. It is not typically associated with a diffuse palatal swelling.
* Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a malignant tumor that can occur in the salivary glands. It is not typically associated with a diffuse palatal swelling.

Explanation:
The patient has a history of a "party trick" which involved puffing out his cheeks to force air into his neck with subsequent decompression of air back into his oral cavity by pushing behind his ear. This became a habitual behavior, which the patient performed multiple times per day. On examination, there was a tender, fluctuant pocket of the left neck near the angle of the mandible without significant crepitus. Additional examination findings are demonstrated in the Figure, C.

The most likely diagnosis is pneumoparotid, which is a condition characterized by the presence of air in the parotid gland. This can occur as a result of trauma, infection, or a spontaneous rupture of a parotid duct. The patient's history of a "party trick" involving puffing out his cheeks to force air into his neck is consistent with a diagnosis of pneumoparotid.

Esophageal perforation is a serious condition that can be life-threatening. It is typically caused by trauma, such as a foreign body in the esophagus, or by a medical procedure, such as endoscopy. The patient's history and examination findings are not consistent with a diagnosis of esophageal perforation.

Necrotizing fasciitis is a severe infection of the skin and underlying tissues. It is typically caused by bacteria, such as group A streptococcus. The patient's history and examination findings are not consistent with a diagnosis of necrotizing fasciitis.

Spontaneous pneumomediastinum is a condition characterized by the presence of air in the mediastinum, which is the space between the lungs. It is typically caused by a rupture of a small airway, such as a bronchiole. The patient's history and examination findings are not consistent with a diagnosis of spontaneous pneumomediastinum.

The patient's corneal opacities are likely due to rifabutin, a drug she was taking for disseminated MAC infection. Rifabutin can cause posterior corneal deposits in up to 20% of patients, and these deposits are usually asymptomatic and do not require treatment. In rare cases, the deposits can cause visual impairment, but this is not the case with this patient.

Given the patient's history and examination findings, the most appropriate management is to reassure her and observe her closely. If the deposits worsen or cause visual impairment, then treatment with topical corticosteroids or a descemetorhexis and posterior cornea biopsy may be necessary. However, at this time, there is no need to initiate any treatment.

A: Start treatment with topical corticosteroids is incorrect because the patient's corneal opacities are likely due to rifabutin, and corticosteroids can worsen these deposits.

B: Start treatment with topical antibiotics is incorrect because the patient's corneal opacities are not due to an infection.

C: Plan a descemetorhexis and posterior cornea biopsy is incorrect because the patient's corneal opacities are not severe enough to warrant these procedures.

Explanation: The patient has a history of cyclical fevers, muscle pain, joint swelling, and headache, all of which are consistent with an infectious or inflammatory process. The presence of optic nerve swelling and visual field constriction suggests that the optic nerves are involved in the inflammatory process. Blood testing for infectious and inflammatory agents can help to identify the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms and guide treatment.

Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the neck is not indicated in this case because there is no evidence of a vascular disorder. Treatment with oral prednisone is a possible treatment option, but it is not the most appropriate first-line treatment in this case.

The patient's history of type 2 diabetes and thyroid cancer is concerning for a genetic predisposition to retinal pigment abnormalities. Obtaining a family medical history and pursuing genetic testing would help to determine if the patient has a genetic mutation that is associated with retinal pigment abnormalities. This information could then be used to develop a personalized treatment plan for the patient.

The other answers are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Answer A: Initiate AREDS (Age-Related Eye Disease Study) nutritional supplement treatment for age-related macular degeneration is incorrect because the patient's retinal pigment abnormalities are not consistent with age-related macular degeneration.
* Answer B: Monitor retinal pigment abnormalities without further workup is incorrect because the patient's retinal pigment abnormalities are concerning for a genetic predisposition to retinal pigment abnormalities. Further workup, such as obtaining a family medical history and pursuing genetic testing, is necessary to determine if the patient has a genetic mutation that is associated with retinal pigment abnormalities.
* Answer D: Refer for intensification of oral therapy for type 2 diabetes is incorrect because the patient's retinal pigment abnormalities are not directly related to her type 2 diabetes. While it is important to manage her type 2 diabetes, this is not the most important next step in her care.

The patient in the case presented with recurrent left eye redness and photophobia for the past year. The patient had previously been treated with topical corticosteroid therapy, which provided temporary relief of his symptoms. Visual acuity was 20/20 OU with normal intraocular pressures. The results from the slitlamp examination of the right eye were within normal limits. Examination results of the left eye demonstrated 2+ diffuse conjunctival hyperemia, 1+ anterior chamber cell, and a vascularized iris infiltrate. Results of the dilated fundus examination were within normal limits in both eyes. Ultrasound biomicroscopy of the left eye demonstrated areas of ciliary body thickening 360° and a thickened iris pupillary margin superiorly and nasally. A full review of systems was negative for other abnormalities including skin lesions. Test results for tuberculosis and syphilis were negative.

The differential diagnosis for the patient's symptoms includes juvenile xanthogranuloma, sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, syphilis, and herpes zoster ophthalmicus. Juvenile xanthogranuloma is a rare, non-neoplastic, inflammatory disorder of unknown cause that typically affects children under the age of 10 years. It can involve the skin, eyes, bones, and central nervous system. The most common ocular finding in juvenile xanthogranuloma is a granulomatous uveitis. The granulomas can involve the iris, ciliary body, and choroid.

The treatment for juvenile xanthogranuloma is usually with systemic corticosteroids. In some cases, surgical removal of the granulomas may be necessary. The prognosis for juvenile xanthogranuloma is generally good, with most patients experiencing complete resolution of their symptoms.

In the case presented, the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of juvenile xanthogranuloma. The patient's age, the presence of a granulomatous uveitis, and the negative results of tests for tuberculosis, syphilis, and herpes zoster ophthalmicus all support this diagnosis.

The next step in the management of this patient is to perform a biopsy of the iris lesion. This will allow for a definitive diagnosis and will also help to determine the extent of the disease. If the biopsy confirms a diagnosis of juvenile xanthogranuloma, the patient will likely be treated with systemic corticosteroids. In some cases, surgical removal of the granulomas may also be necessary.

The other options listed are not appropriate for the management of this patient. Option B, administering subtenon corticosteroid injection, is not a definitive treatment for juvenile xanthogranuloma. Option C, performing anterior chamber paracentesis for viral polymerase chain reaction, is not indicated in this case because there is no evidence of a viral infection. Option D, screening for antinuclear antibody, is not helpful in the diagnosis or management of juvenile xanthogranuloma.

Explanation:

The patient in this case has dysphagia, which is difficulty swallowing. The EGD showed vertical furrows and circumferential rings in the esophagus, which are characteristic of achalasia. Achalasia is a disorder of the esophagus that is characterized by impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and abnormal esophageal peristalsis. This results in difficulty swallowing, chest pain, and regurgitation of food.

Esophageal high-resolution manometry (HRM) is the gold standard test for diagnosing achalasia. HRM measures the pressure in the esophagus and LES. In achalasia, the LES is typically found to be hypertensive and the esophageal peristalsis is typically absent or abnormal.

Treatment for achalasia typically involves balloon dilation or surgical myotomy. Balloon dilation is a procedure in which a balloon is inflated in the LES to stretch it open. Surgical myotomy is a procedure in which the LES is cut open to allow food to pass more easily.

In this case, the patient should be referred for HRM to confirm the diagnosis of achalasia. If the diagnosis of achalasia is confirmed, the patient should be offered balloon dilation or surgical myotomy.

 27%|██▋       | 416/1525 [1:35:56<3:36:44, 11.73s/it]The correct answer is: **A: Annular pustular psoriasis**

Annular pustular psoriasis is a rare, self-limiting, pustular eruption that occurs predominantly in middle-aged and elderly men. It is characterized by the sudden onset of multiple annular or arcuate plaques of erythema, with central clearing and peripheral pustulation. The lesions are typically located on the trunk, proximal extremities, and scalp.

The cause of annular pustular psoriasis is unknown, but it is thought to be a T-cell-mediated autoimmune disorder. It is often associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis, and Crohn's disease.

The diagnosis of annular pustular psoriasis is based on the clinical presentation and a skin biopsy. The histopathologic findings are characteristic of psoriasis, with parakeratosis, Munro microabscesses, and spongiosis.

There is no specific treatment for annular pustular psoriasis, but it is often responsive to topical corticosteroids, oral retinoids, and phototherapy. In severe cases, systemic corticosteroids may be required.

The prognosis for annular pustular psoriasis is generally good, with most patients experiencing spontaneous remission within a few months. However, the condition can be recurrent, and some patients may experience chronic disease.

Explanation:

The patient in the case presented has a well-demarcated, circular erythematous plaque with multiple concentric annular formations with raised erythematous margins and studded with numerous blisters and pustules, some coalescing into lakes of pus. This is characteristic of annular pustular psoriasis.

Bullous tinea is a fungal infection of the skin that can cause blisters and pustules. However, the lesions are typically located on the feet and are not associated with annular formations.

Linear IgA dermatosis is a rare autoimmune disorder that can cause blisters and pustules on the skin. However, the lesions are typically linear in shape and are not associated with annular formations.

Acute localized exanthematous pustulosis is a self-limiting, pustular eruption that typically occurs in children. It is characterized by the sudden onset of multiple small pustules on the trunk and extremities. The lesions are not associated with annular formations.

Spindle cell lipoma is a benign (noncancerous) tumor of fat cells. It is the most common type of lipoma, accounting for about 60% of all lipomas. Spindle cell lipomas typically occur in adults, with a peak incidence in the fourth and fifth decades of life. They are more common in men than in women.

Spindle cell lipomas can occur anywhere on the body, but they are most common on the trunk (back, abdomen, and chest). They are usually solitary tumors, but they can occur in multiple locations. Spindle cell lipomas are typically painless, but they can cause discomfort if they are large or if they press on nerves or other structures.

The diagnosis of spindle cell lipoma is made on the basis of a biopsy. The biopsy specimen is examined under a microscope, and the characteristic features of spindle cell lipoma are seen.

Spindle cell lipomas are usually treated by surgical excision. The tumor is removed with a margin of healthy tissue, and the wound is closed with stitches. Spindle cell lipomas are almost always cured with surgery.

The other options are incorrect because they are all malignant (cancerous) tumors.

A: Lupus panniculitis (subcutaneous lupus erythematosus) is a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the skin and subcutaneous fat. It is characterized by inflammation of the fat cells, which can lead to pain, swelling, and redness. Lupus panniculitis can occur anywhere on the body, but it is most common on the face, neck, and upper arms. It is a chronic condition that can flare up and then go into remission.

C: Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a rare type of skin cancer that grows slowly over time. It usually appears as a small, raised bump on the skin that is often mistaken for a wart or mole. DFSP can occur anywhere on the body, but it is most common on the legs, arms, and trunk. It is a locally aggressive cancer that can spread to other parts of the body if it is not treated.

D: Diffuse pattern neurofibroma is a rare type of nerve tumor that grows in the skin and soft tissues. It is a benign (noncancerous) tumor that is often associated with the genetic disorder neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Diffuse pattern neurofibromas can occur anywhere on the body, but they are most common on the head and neck. They are usually small, painless tumors that do not cause any problems. However, they can grow large enough to cause pain, disfigurement, and nerve damage.

Explanation:

Bullous mastocytosis is a rare, chronic, non-neoplastic disorder characterized by the presence of mast cells in the skin. It is usually diagnosed in children, but can occur at any age. The most common presenting symptom is recurrent blisters, which are often accompanied by itching, redness, and swelling. The blisters may occur anywhere on the body, but are most common on the trunk and extremities.

The diagnosis of bullous mastocytosis is based on the clinical presentation and a skin biopsy. The biopsy will show a dense infiltrate of mast cells in the upper dermis. There is no specific treatment for bullous mastocytosis, but the symptoms can be managed with antihistamines, corticosteroids, and other medications.

The other options are incorrect because they do not fit the clinical presentation of the patient. Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa is a genetic disorder characterized by the fragility of the skin. It is usually diagnosed at birth or in early infancy. The characteristic lesions are blisters that occur at sites of minor trauma, such as friction or pressure. Chronic bullous disease of childhood is a rare, autoimmune disorder characterized by the formation of blisters on the skin. The blisters are usually preceded by an urticarial rash. Congenital erythropoietic porphyria is a rare, genetic disorder characterized by the accumulation of porphyrins in the blood and skin. The characteristic symptoms are photosensitivity, skin fragility, and red urine.

The patient is presenting with symptoms of schizophrenia, including auditory hallucinations, delusions, and social withdrawal. Schizophrenia is a chronic mental illness that affects about 1% of the population. There is no cure for schizophrenia, but it can be treated with medication and therapy.

The first step in treating schizophrenia is to assess the patient's symptoms and risk of harm to themselves or others. This includes a physical exam, a mental status exam, and a review of the patient's medical history. Once the patient's symptoms have been assessed, the doctor will need to decide which medication is right for the patient.

There are several different types of medication that can be used to treat schizophrenia. The most common medications are antipsychotics. Antipsychotics work by blocking the effects of dopamine, a neurotransmitter that is thought to play a role in schizophrenia. There are several different types of antipsychotics, and each one has its own set of side effects. Some common side effects of antipsychotics include weight gain, drowsiness, and dizziness.

In some cases, the patient may need to take more than one medication to control their symptoms. The doctor will need to monitor the patient closely to make sure that the medication is working and that the patient is not experiencing any side effects.

In addition to medication, the patient may also benefit from therapy. Therapy can help the patient to understand their illness and to develop coping skills. Therapy can also help the patient to connect with others and to improve their social functioning.

The treatment of schizophrenia is a complex process that requires careful planning and monitoring. The goal of treatment is to help the patient to manage their symptoms and to live a productive life.

Explanation:

The other options are incorrect because they do not represent the first step in treating schizophrenia. Option B is incorrect because it would be premature to start treatment with oral olanzapine without first assessing the patient's symptoms and risk of harm. Option C is incorrect because it would be premature to start treatment with oral clozapine without first assessing the patient's symptoms and risk of harm. Option D is incorrect because cognitive behavioral therapy for psychosis is not a first-line treatment for schizophrenia.

The patient presented with fever of unknown origin, pancytopenia, and diffuse bone marrow hypercaptation. The bone marrow biopsy showed a diffuse infiltrate of large lymphoid cells. Immunostaining showed that the lymphoid cells were strongly positive for paired box protein Pax-5, a marker of B-cell lineage. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of large B-cell lymphoma.

Infectious bone marrow disease is a broad term that can include a variety of conditions, such as bacterial osteomyelitis, fungal osteomyelitis, and viral osteomyelitis. The patient's history and physical examination do not suggest an infectious etiology.

Primary bone lymphoma is a rare type of lymphoma that arises in the bone. It is typically seen in young adults and is characterized by a mass lesion in the bone. The patient's imaging studies do not show a mass lesion in the bone.

Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis is a rare, life-threatening disorder characterized by hemophagocytosis (the engulfment of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets by macrophages) and a systemic inflammatory response syndrome. The patient's history and physical examination do not suggest a diagnosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is large B-cell lymphoma.

Explanation: The patient in this case has a history of bulimia, which is a condition that can lead to electrolyte derangements. The patient's initial ECG showed a regular wide complex tachycardia, which is a potentially life-threatening arrhythmia. The patient was also found to have hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, which are electrolyte abnormalities that can cause arrhythmias. The patient was initially treated with synchronized cardioversion and intravenous amiodarone. After the patient's electrolytes were repleted, she was started on ambulatory cardiac monitoring. This is the appropriate next step in the management of this patient because it will allow the clinician to determine if the patient has any arrhythmias that are not apparent on the resting ECG. If the patient does have any arrhythmias on ambulatory cardiac monitoring, further testing, such as cardiac catheterization or electrophysiology study, may be necessary. However, it is important to first rule out any arrhythmias that are caused by electrolyte abnormalities before pursuing further testing.

The other options are not appropriate next steps in the management of this patient. Coronary angiography is not indicated in this patient because she has no history of coronary artery disease and her ECG does not show any signs of ischemia. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging is not indicated in this patient because it is not a sensitive test for arrhythmias. Invasive electrophysiology study is not indicated in this patient because she has no history of arrhythmias and her initial ECG does not show any signs of an arrhythmia.

Explanation:

A lateral saccular cyst is a benign, developmental lesion that arises from the mucosa of the larynx. It is most commonly found in the supraglottic region, but can also occur in the subglottic or glottic regions. Lateral saccular cysts are typically asymptomatic, but can present with symptoms such as stridor, hoarseness, and a foreign body sensation in the throat. Diagnosis is made with laryngoscopy or bronchoscopy. Treatment is usually surgical excision.

The patient in this case presented with loud stridor and respiratory distress at birth. These symptoms are consistent with a large mass in the airway. The history of an uncomplicated pregnancy and normal prenatal ultrasonography results make a congenital anomaly, such as a lateral saccular cyst, more likely than an acquired condition, such as a laryngeal neurofibroma or granular cell tumor. The physical examination findings of a large, flesh-colored mass in the larynx are also consistent with a lateral saccular cyst. Chest radiography showed no evidence of a mass or other abnormality that could be causing the stridor. Direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy revealed a large, submucosal mass involving the left side of the epiglottis, false fold, aryepiglottic fold, and arytenoid. This is also consistent with a lateral saccular cyst.

Granular cell tumors and laryngeal neurofibromas are both rare, benign neoplasms that can occur in the larynx. However, they are more likely to present in adults than in neonates. Granular cell tumors are typically located in the subglottic region, while laryngeal neurofibromas are more commonly found in the glottic region. Both of these tumors can cause symptoms such as stridor, hoarseness, and a foreign body sensation in the throat. Diagnosis is made with laryngoscopy or bronchoscopy. Treatment is usually surgical excision.

Macrocystic lymphatic malformations are rare, congenital anomalies that can occur in any part of the body, including the larynx. They are composed of dilated lymphatic channels that can cause symptoms such as stridor, hoarseness, and a foreign body sensation in the throat. Diagnosis is made with imaging studies, such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Treatment is usually surgical excision.

In conclusion, the patient in this case has a lateral saccular cyst. This is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's history, physical examination findings, and imaging studies.

The patient's history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in the left parotid gland and hypopharynx, as well as the histopathologic findings of myogenin-positive spindle cells with no tumor necrosis, desmin-positive and CD34-positive cells, and focal infiltration into the fibrous tissue, skeletal muscle, and bone, are all consistent with a diagnosis of spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma.

Malignant fibrous histiocytoma is a rare soft tissue sarcoma that typically occurs in adults. It is characterized by a pleomorphic spindle cell morphology and a high mitotic rate. Paraganglioma is a neuroendocrine tumor that can occur in the head and neck, abdomen, and pelvis. It is characterized by the presence of neuroendocrine cells that express neuroendocrine markers such as synaptophysin and chromogranin. Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that can also occur in the head and neck. It is characterized by the presence of squamous cell carcinoma cells that express keratin and p63.

The patient's history and histopathologic findings are not consistent with a diagnosis of malignant fibrous histiocytoma, paraganglioma, or squamous cell carcinoma. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is spindle cell rhabdomyosarcoma.

Explanation:

The most likely diagnosis is a thyroglossal duct cyst. This is a congenital cyst that arises from remnants of the thyroglossal duct, which is a structure that forms in the embryo and normally regresses during development. Thyroglossal duct cysts are most common in the midline of the neck, just above the suprasternal notch. They are typically smooth, round or oval, and fluctuant. They may be present at birth or may develop later in childhood. Most thyroglossal duct cysts are asymptomatic, but they may become infected or cause pressure symptoms. Treatment is surgical excision.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Eruptive vellus hair cysts are small, superficial cysts that are filled with hair shafts. They are most common on the face, neck, and trunk.
* Cutaneous bronchogenic cysts are rare cysts that arise from remnants of the embryonic lung. They are most common in the chest, but they can also occur in the neck.

Explanation:

A liposarcoma is a malignant neoplasm derived from adipose tissue. It is the most common type of soft tissue sarcoma. Hibernomas are benign tumors of brown adipose tissue. Angiolipomas are benign tumors composed of adipose tissue and blood vessels.

In the case presented, the patient is a 25-year-old woman with a 6-month history of an enlarging right neck mass. The mass is nontender, compressible, and deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle. The patient has no other symptoms. The CT scan shows a fatty-appearing tumor within the right carotid space. The patient underwent surgical excision of the mass, and the pathology report showed a well-differentiated lipoma.

The differential diagnosis for a fatty-appearing neck mass includes lipoma, liposarcoma, hibernoma, and angiolipoma. Lipomas are the most common type of benign soft tissue tumor. They are composed of mature adipocytes, and they are usually solitary and well-circumscribed. Liposarcomas are malignant tumors of adipose tissue. They are rare, and they can be classified into four subtypes: well-differentiated, myxoid, pleomorphic, and dedifferentiated. Hibernomas are benign tumors of brown adipose tissue. They are rare, and they are usually found in the neck, axilla, or mediastinum. Angiolipomas are benign tumors composed of adipose tissue and blood vessels. They are rare, and they are usually found in the subcutaneous tissue of the extremities.

The patient in the case presented has a history of a slowly enlarging, nontender, compressible mass in the right neck. The mass is deep to the sternocleidomastoid muscle, and it is well-circumscribed. The CT scan shows a fatty-appearing tumor within the right carotid space. The pathology report shows a well-differentiated lipoma. Based on the history, physical examination, imaging studies, and pathology report, the most likely diagnosis is a lipoma.

The patient has acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and is undergoing induction therapy with all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide. He presents with sudden loss of vision. The differential diagnosis for sudden vision loss in a patient with APL includes retinoic acid syndrome, a life-threatening complication of ATRA therapy. Retinoic acid syndrome is characterized by fever, weight gain, respiratory distress, and multiorgan dysfunction. It is thought to be caused by a rapid release of cytokines from the promyelocytes as they differentiate into mature granulocytes.

The most important diagnostic test for retinoic acid syndrome is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits with and without contrast. MRI can show evidence of cerebral edema, meningeal enhancement, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. Lumbar puncture can show evidence of leukocytosis, elevated protein, and decreased glucose.

If retinoic acid syndrome is suspected, treatment should be initiated immediately with high-dose steroids and supportive care. Steroids help to reduce inflammation and prevent the release of cytokines. Supportive care includes treatment of any organ dysfunction and blood transfusions to correct anemia and thrombocytopenia.

The other options are incorrect because they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's vision loss. Continuing chemotherapy therapy without treating the retinoic acid syndrome could worsen the patient's condition. Stopping ATRA without starting steroids could also worsen the patient's condition. Sending HLA-B51 is not necessary to diagnose retinoic acid syndrome.

The patient has a history of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma that was treated with chemotherapy, followed by a relapse that required additional chemotherapy and ultimately autologous bone marrow transplant 3 months before presentation. This history suggests that the patient is at risk for developing opportunistic infections, including cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis. The patient's current presentation, with subacute, painless vision loss in the right eye, is consistent with CMV retinitis.

The gold standard treatment for CMV retinitis is intravitreal foscarnet. Intravitreal foscarnet is a potent antiviral agent that can be delivered directly to the vitreous humor, where it is effective in killing CMV-infected cells. Intravitreal foscarnet is typically administered weekly for 2-4 weeks, or until the CMV retinitis has resolved.

In addition to intravitreal foscarnet, the patient should also be treated with intravenous acyclovir. Acyclovir is a broad-spectrum antiviral agent that is effective against a variety of viruses, including CMV. Intravenous acyclovir is typically administered for 2-4 weeks, or until the CMV retinitis has resolved.

The patient should also be monitored closely for signs of CMV infection in other organs, such as the lungs, esophagus, and gastrointestinal tract. If CMV infection is suspected in other organs, the patient should be treated with appropriate antiviral therapy.

The other options are incorrect because they do not provide adequate treatment for CMV retinitis. Intravitreal clindamycin is an antibiotic that is not effective against CMV. Administering an intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor agent followed by panretinal photocoagulation would not be effective for CMV retinitis. Panretinal photocoagulation is a procedure that is used to treat diabetic retinopathy, not CMV retinitis.

Explanation:

The patient has a rapidly enlarging fleshy nodule of the right nasal conjunctiva that is associated with a history of bladder cancer. The lesion did not change in appearance after a 3-week course of oral prednisone therapy, which suggests that it is not inflammatory in nature. The lack of response to oral prednisone therapy also raises the suspicion of a possible malignant neoplasm.

A complete excisional biopsy is the most definitive way to diagnose the lesion and determine whether it is malignant. This would involve removing the entire lesion with a margin of healthy tissue. The tissue would then be sent to a pathologist for evaluation.

Administering intralesional corticosteroids or topical antibiotics would not be appropriate in this case. Intralesional corticosteroids can be used to treat inflammatory lesions, but they would not be effective against a malignant neoplasm. Topical antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections, but there is no evidence that the lesion is infected.

Obtaining a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits would not be helpful in this case. An MRI would be used to look for evidence of metastasis, but the patient does not have any symptoms that suggest that the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.

Therefore, the best course of action is to perform a complete excisional biopsy of the lesion. This would allow the pathologist to diagnose the lesion and determine whether it is malignant. If the lesion is malignant, then the patient can be treated with appropriate therapy.

The patient has a history of herpes simplex keratitis, which is a viral infection. The current presentation of epithelial dendritic lesion with corneal edema is consistent with a recurrence of herpes simplex keratitis. The results of the viral polymerase chain reaction and potassium hydroxide tests were negative, which rules out bacterial and fungal infections, respectively. The positive results of the bacterial cultures for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli suggest that the patient has a mixed infection with both viral and bacterial pathogens.

Oral antiviral therapy is indicated for herpes simplex keratitis. Topical antibiotics are also indicated to treat the bacterial infection. The combination of oral antiviral and topical antibiotic therapy is the most effective treatment for herpes simplex keratitis with a mixed infection.

Starting only topical antibiotics would not be sufficient to treat the viral infection. Starting only oral antiviral therapy would not be sufficient to treat the bacterial infection. Admitting the patient for intravenous antiviral therapy would be an unnecessary and expensive intervention, as the patient can be treated effectively with oral antiviral and topical antibiotic therapy as an outpatient.

The patient has a long history of seronegative rheumatoid arthritis, which has been treated with a variety of therapies without significant improvement. He has also developed intermittent fevers, diarrhea, weight loss, and abdominal pain. The initial workup was unremarkable, but repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed histologic changes consistent with celiac disease.

Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes inflammation of the small intestine in response to gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. Symptoms of celiac disease can vary, but they often include diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, and weight loss. The diagnosis is made based on a combination of clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, and small bowel biopsy.

The treatment for celiac disease is a gluten-free diet. This means avoiding all foods that contain gluten, including bread, pasta, cereal, and beer. With strict adherence to a gluten-free diet, most people with celiac disease experience significant improvement in their symptoms.

In this case, the patient's symptoms are consistent with celiac disease. The repeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy showed histologic changes consistent with celiac disease. Therefore, the next step in management is to refer the patient to a nutritionist for education on a gluten-free diet.

Antimicrobial therapy is not indicated in this case because the patient does not have an infection. Intravenous immunoglobulin therapy is not indicated in this case because the patient does not have a hematologic malignancy. Genetic analysis for evaluation of hematologic malignancy is not indicated in this case because the patient does not have a hematologic malignancy.

The patient's presentation is consistent with cholangitis due to Ascaris lumbricoides infection. Ascaris is the most common human helminth infection worldwide, and it is particularly prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions. The infection is acquired by ingestion of Ascaris eggs, which are shed in the feces of infected individuals. The eggs hatch in the small intestine, and the larvae migrate through the bloodstream to the lungs, where they are coughed up and swallowed. The larvae then mature into adult worms in the small intestine. Adult worms can live for up to 2 years and can produce up to 200,000 eggs per day.

The most common symptoms of Ascaris infection are abdominal pain, diarrhea, and cough. In some cases, the worms can migrate to other organs, such as the liver, biliary tree, or pancreas, causing obstruction and inflammation. Cholangitis is a serious complication of Ascaris infection that can lead to sepsis and death.

The treatment of Ascaris infection is with anthelminthic drugs, such as mebendazole or albendazole. These drugs kill the adult worms and prevent the production of eggs. The patient should be treated with anthelminthic therapy as soon as possible to prevent complications.

Antibiotics are not necessary for the treatment of Ascaris infection. Antibiotics may be used to treat secondary bacterial infections that may occur as a complication of Ascaris infection.

Serologic testing for Ascaris is not necessary for the diagnosis of Ascaris infection. Serologic testing can be used to confirm the diagnosis of Ascaris infection, but it is not necessary in most cases.

Therefore, the correct answer is: A. Prescribe anthelminthic therapy alone.

The patient's history of a similar eruption after taking ibuprofen suggests that she may have herpes labialis, a viral infection that causes cold sores. Ibuprofen is a known trigger for herpes labialis, so discontinuing it is the most likely way to prevent further outbreaks.

Valacyclovir is an antiviral medication that can be used to treat herpes labialis. However, it is not necessary in this case, as the patient's lesions are already resolving on their own.

Discontinue all cosmetics is not necessary, as there is no evidence that cosmetics are a trigger for herpes labialis.

Administering antibiotics is not necessary, as herpes labialis is a viral infection, not a bacterial infection. Antibiotics are not effective against viruses.

The lesion is a solitary, nodular, itchy nodule on the right labium majus. This is consistent with the clinical presentation of granuloma inguinale. The histopathologic analysis of the nodule showed pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia with transepidermal elimination of basophilic oval-shaped structures in the epidermis and a dense acute and chronic dermal infiltrate in the dermis. This is also consistent with the histopathologic findings of granuloma inguinale. The other options are incorrect because they do not fit the clinical presentation or histopathologic findings of the patient's lesion.

Onchocerciasis is a parasitic infection caused by the nematode Onchocerca volvulus. It is a major public health problem in Africa, Latin America, and the Middle East. The most common clinical manifestation of onchocerciasis is skin disease, which can range from mild to severe. The skin lesions are typically non-tender, pruritic papules or nodules. Histopathologic examination of skin lesions shows a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with eosinophils and occasional giant cells.

Late cutaneous bilharziasis is a chronic skin condition caused by the trematode Schistosoma haematobium. It is most common in Africa, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia. The most common clinical manifestation of late cutaneous bilharziasis is a nodular lesion on the lower extremities. The lesions are typically pruritic and may be associated with ulceration. Histopathologic examination of skin lesions shows a granulomatous reaction with fibrosis and calcification.

Periorificial cutaneous tuberculosis is a rare form of tuberculosis that occurs in the skin around the mouth, nose, and eyes. It is most common in children and young adults. The most common clinical manifestation of periorificial cutaneous tuberculosis is a papule or nodule that ulcerates. The lesions are typically painful and may be associated with regional lymphadenopathy. Histopathologic examination of skin lesions shows a granulomatous reaction with caseation necrosis.

Granuloma inguinale is a chronic, sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Calymmatobacterium granulomatis. It is most common in tropical and subtropical regions. The most common clinical manifestation of granuloma inguinale is a painless, beefy red ulcer on the genitals. The lesions may be single or multiple and may be associated with inguinal lymphadenopathy. Histopathologic examination of skin lesions shows a granulomatous reaction with giant cells.

Explanation:

The patient presented with a 3-month history of gradual growth of a pruriginous, reddish nodule on the left ear. He had no relevant medical history. On medical examination, a reddish, smooth, superficial nodule with small dimples and a soft consistency that measured approximately 1.5 cm in diameter was seen on the left earlobe. It was not painful to the touch. The patient reported no history of lesions or foreign bodies at this location. A biopsy specimen was obtained for histopathologic analysis.

The histopathologic findings revealed mixed diffuse dermatitis involving the reticular dermis, with small-vessel vasculitis, characteristic sparing of a superficial dermal grenz zone as well as the dilated vessel luminal, and mixed leukocytic infiltrate with eosinophils, lymphocytes, and neutrophils involving the full thickness of the vessel wall.

These findings are consistent with ALHE, a rare benign skin condition characterized by a localized lymphocytic infiltrate with eosinophils. ALHE typically affects middle-aged adults and is more common in women. The most common presentation is a single, solitary nodule on the head or neck, although multiple lesions can occur. The lesions are usually pruritic and may be painful. The diagnosis of ALHE is made on clinical and histopathologic grounds. There is no specific treatment for ALHE, but most cases resolve spontaneously within a few months. Treatment options for persistent or recurrent lesions include topical steroids, oral steroids, and surgical excision.

Sweet syndrome, extrafacial granuloma faciale, and leishmaniasis are all possible diagnoses in this case, but they are less likely than ALHE based on the clinical and histopathologic findings. Sweet syndrome is a rare, self-limited inflammatory disorder characterized by fever, neutrophilic leukocytosis, and tender skin lesions. The lesions of Sweet syndrome are typically erythematous papules or plaques that may coalesce into larger areas of inflammation. Extrafacial granuloma faciale is a rare, benign skin condition characterized by small, discrete, reddish-brown papules on the face. The papules of extrafacial granuloma faciale are usually asymptomatic, but they may be pruritic. Leishmaniasis is a parasitic infection caused by protozoa of the genus Leishmania. Leishmaniasis can cause a variety of skin lesions, including papules, nodules, and ulcers. The diagnosis of leishmaniasis is made based on clinical findings, laboratory testing, and histopathologic examination.

Explanation:
The most likely diagnosis in this case is a pyogenic brain abscess. The patient presents with headache, double vision, seizures, and altered consciousness, all of which are consistent with a brain abscess. The patient also has facial flushing and grade III clubbing in his fingers and toes, which are non-specific findings that may be seen in patients with pyogenic brain abscesses. The cranial magnetic resonance image shows two ring-enhancing lesions in the right frontal and left parietal cortexes, along with surrounding brain edema and mass effects. Both lesions show a thin-walled, contrast-enhancing rim with a central liquefaction, which is characteristic of a pyogenic brain abscess. The central liquefaction showed restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance images, which is a finding that is more commonly seen in pyogenic brain abscesses than in other types of brain abscesses. The patient's hemoglobin level, total leukocyte count, hematocrit, and platelet count are all normal, which suggests that he does not have a systemic infection. The patient's liver and renal function test results are also normal, which suggests that he does not have a systemic infection. The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for HIV is nonreactive, which suggests that the patient does not have HIV. The radiograph of his chest shows a nodular shadow in the left middle field of the lung, which could be a sign of a lung abscess. However, the patient's chest radiography findings are not specific for a lung abscess, and the patient does not have any other symptoms or signs of a lung abscess. The 2-dimensional echocardiogram does not show any evidence of congenital heart disease. The arterial blood gas test result shows an oxygen saturation level of 80%, which is consistent with a right-to-left shunt. However, the patient does not have any other symptoms or signs of a right-to-left shunt. The patient's blood cultures were found to be sterile, which suggests that he does not have a bacterial infection.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis in this case is a pyogenic brain abscess.

Explanation:

The patient in the case report presented with a number of clinical features that are characteristic of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis, including:

* Painless masses on the Achilles tendons, which are the tendons that attach the calf muscles to the heel bone. These masses are caused by the accumulation of cholesterol and other lipids in the tendons.
* Personality changes, such as irritability, short-temperedness, and hyperactivity. These changes are thought to be caused by damage to the frontal lobes of the brain.
* Memory problems, including difficulty forming new memories. This is also thought to be caused by damage to the frontal lobes of the brain.
* Balance problems, such as difficulty walking in a straight line. This is thought to be caused by damage to the cerebellum, which is the part of the brain that controls balance.
* Elevated levels of triglycerides in the blood. Triglycerides are a type of fat that can build up in the blood and cause damage to the arteries.
* Abnormal signals on brain MRI scans. These signals are caused by the accumulation of cholesterol and other lipids in the brain.
* Genetic testing that indicates a mutation in the CYP27A1 gene. This gene is responsible for producing an enzyme that helps to break down cholesterol. If this enzyme is not working properly, cholesterol can build up in the body, including in the brain.

All of these features are consistent with a diagnosis of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain all of the clinical features that the patient presented with.

Explanation:
The patient in the case presented with new-onset heart failure. The echocardiogram showed a normal left ventricular ejection fraction with no substantial wall motion abnormalities. However, there was an echogenic band traversing the apical portion of the left ventricle with increased echogenicity compared with the adjacent myocardium. This finding is consistent with left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy, a rare congenital heart disease characterized by a lack of normal myocardial compaction during fetal development. Cardiac MRI is the gold standard for the diagnosis of left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy. It can provide detailed information about the anatomy of the left ventricle, including the extent of noncompaction, the presence of any associated abnormalities, and the function of the left ventricle. Cardiac MRI can also be used to assess the response to treatment.

Endomyocardial biopsy is a procedure that involves taking a small sample of tissue from the heart muscle. This procedure is typically used to diagnose other types of heart disease, such as myocarditis or cardiomyopathy. It is not routinely used to diagnose left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy.

A whole-body positron emission tomography/computed tomography scan (PET/CT) is a nuclear medicine imaging test that is used to detect cancer and other diseases. It is not typically used to diagnose left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy.

Genetic testing for noncompaction is not routinely recommended for the diagnosis of left ventricular noncompaction cardiomyopathy. This is because the test is not always accurate and it can be expensive. Genetic testing may be helpful in some cases, such as when the diagnosis is uncertain or when there is a family history of the disease.

Explanation:

Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a rare, non-neoplastic, mesenchymal tumor that typically occurs in children and young adults. It is characterized by a proliferation of spindle-shaped cells with variable atypia, admixed with inflammatory cells, including lymphocytes and plasma cells. The tumor is typically located in the lung, but it can also occur in other organs, including the larynx.

The diagnosis of IMT is made on the basis of clinical, pathologic, and immunohistochemical findings. The tumor is typically positive for vimentin and ALK1, and negative for desmin, S100, P63, and cytokeratin.

The treatment of IMT is typically surgical excision. The tumor has a good prognosis, with most patients experiencing long-term disease control.

In the case presented, the patient is a 45-year-old woman with a history of a left vocal fold polyp that was removed 2 months earlier. She presented with hoarseness and a hemorrhagic-appearing polyp on the left vocal fold. The patient was taken to the operating room for excision of the mass. Pathologic examination revealed a spindle-shaped cell proliferation with variable atypia, admixed with inflammatory cells, including lymphocytes and plasma cells. The tumor was positive for vimentin and ALK1, and negative for desmin, S100, P63, and cytokeratin. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of IMT.

The patient was treated with surgical excision of the tumor. She has had no recurrent disease for the past 3 years.

The other answer choices are incorrect. Spindle cell carcinoma is a malignant tumor that is characterized by a proliferation of spindle-shaped cells. Laryngeal granuloma is a benign lesion that is characterized by a proliferation of inflammatory cells. Plasmacytoma of the larynx is a rare, malignant tumor that is characterized by a proliferation of plasma cells.

Explanation:
Glial heterotopia is the correct diagnosis because the patient has a history of cerebellar hypoplasia, which is a congenital anomaly of the cerebellum. Glial heterotopias are benign lesions that are composed of mature glial cells that are misplaced in the brain. They are thought to occur due to abnormal migration of glial cells during embryogenesis. Glial heterotopias are usually asymptomatic, but they can cause seizures, developmental delays, and hydrocephalus. Treatment is usually not necessary, but surgery may be performed to remove a symptomatic lesion.

Lipomas are benign tumors that are composed of fat cells. They are the most common type of soft tissue tumor. Lipomas can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the trunk and extremities. They are usually asymptomatic, but they can cause pain, discomfort, and cosmetic problems. Treatment is usually not necessary, but surgery may be performed to remove a symptomatic lesion.

Rhabdomyosarcomas are malignant tumors that are composed of skeletal muscle cells. They are the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children. Rhabdomyosarcomas can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the head and neck, extremities, and genitourinary tract. They are usually aggressive tumors that can metastasize to other parts of the body. Treatment usually involves surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.

Infantile hemangiomas are benign tumors that are composed of blood vessels. They are the most common type of tumor in infants. Infantile hemangiomas usually appear within the first few weeks of life and typically resolve spontaneously within a few years. They are usually not harmful, but they can cause cosmetic problems and, in rare cases, life-threatening complications. Treatment is usually not necessary, but surgery, laser therapy, or other treatments may be used to remove or reduce the size of a symptomatic hemangioma.

Explanation:

The patient presented with severe head trauma, which resulted in a right frontal epidural hematoma. The hematoma was evacuated by neurosurgery, and the patient's Glasgow Coma Score (GCS) improved to 14 postoperatively. On postoperative day 2, the patient developed isolated dysphagia and dysphonia. Laryngoscopic examination revealed right vocal cord paralysis.

The most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is cerebral vein thrombosis (CVT). CVT is a rare but serious condition that occurs when one or more of the veins that drain blood from the brain become blocked. This can lead to a stroke, seizures, and other neurological problems.

The patient's history of head trauma and the development of isolated dysphagia and dysphonia on postoperative day 2 are consistent with CVT. The CT scan images show a thrombosis of the right sigmoid-jugular complex, which is a major vein that drains blood from the brain. This thrombosis is likely the cause of the patient's vocal cord paralysis.

Carotid artery dissection is a rare but serious condition that occurs when the wall of the carotid artery, which supplies blood to the brain, tears. This can lead to a stroke, seizures, and other neurological problems. However, the patient's history and presentation are not consistent with carotid artery dissection.

Cerebral vein thrombosis is a more likely diagnosis in this case. The patient's history of head trauma and the development of isolated dysphagia and dysphonia on postoperative day 2 are consistent with CVT. The CT scan images show a thrombosis of the right sigmoid-jugular complex, which is a major vein that drains blood from the brain. This thrombosis is likely the cause of the patient's vocal cord paralysis.

Posttraumatic central motor impairment is a condition that can occur after a head injury. It is characterized by weakness or paralysis on one side of the body. However, the patient's presentation is not consistent with posttraumatic central motor impairment. The patient's weakness is isolated to the vocal cords, and there is no evidence of weakness or paralysis in other parts of the body.

Postoperative laryngeal paralysis is a rare complication of surgery that can occur when the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which controls the movement of the vocal cords, is damaged. However, the patient's presentation is not consistent with postoperative laryngeal paralysis. The patient's weakness developed on postoperative day 2, which is too early for postoperative laryngeal paralysis to develop. Additionally, the patient's weakness is isolated to the vocal cords, and there is no evidence of weakness or paralysis in other parts of the body.

In conclusion, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is cerebral vein thrombosis. The patient's history of head trauma and the development of isolated dysphagia and dysphonia on postoperative day 2 are consistent with CVT. The CT scan images show a thrombosis of the right sigmoid-jugular complex, which is a major vein that drains blood from the brain. This thrombosis is likely the cause of the patient's vocal cord paralysis.

Kimura disease is a rare, chronic, inflammatory disorder characterized by lymphadenopathy, eosinophilia, and angioedema. It is most common in Asian men, but can occur in people of any race or gender.

The exact cause of Kimura disease is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder. Symptoms of Kimura disease typically develop in the third or fourth decade of life. The most common symptom is a painless, enlarged lymph node in the neck, armpit, or groin. Other symptoms may include fever, fatigue, weight loss, and skin rash.

There is no cure for Kimura disease, but treatment can help to control the symptoms. Treatment typically includes medications such as corticosteroids and immunosuppressants. Surgery may be necessary to remove enlarged lymph nodes.

The patient in the case presented has a painless, enlarged retroauricular mass with superficial excoriations. The patient also has a history of eczema, which is a chronic skin condition that is often associated with eosinophilia. The patient's physical examination findings are consistent with Kimura disease, and the patient's serologic studies show an elevated absolute eosinophil count. The patient's T1-weighted postcontrast magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck shows a heterogeneously enhancing mass with irregular borders in the right retroauricular space, with a tract coursing anteriorly toward the parotid gland. These findings are also consistent with Kimura disease. The excised mass was an enlarged, 2.2 × 1.5 × 2.2-cm lymph node with a smooth, pale core and no hemorrhage or necrosis. The capsule was moderately thickened by collagen fibrosis with focal areas of interstitial fibrosis. Reactive follicular hyperplasia was present with prominent eosinophilia in the interfollicular areas and within follicles, forming eosinophilic microabscesses and follicular cysts. These findings are also consistent with Kimura disease.

The differential diagnosis for a painless, enlarged retroauricular mass includes Hodgkin lymphoma, mastoiditis, and brachial cleft cyst. Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system. Mastoiditis is an infection of the mastoid bone, which is located behind the ear. Brachial cleft cyst is a congenital anomaly that occurs when a portion of the brachial cleft does not close properly during fetal development.

The patient's history, physical examination findings, serologic studies, and imaging findings are most consistent with Kimura disease. Hodgkin lymphoma is less likely because the patient does not have any systemic symptoms such as fever, fatigue, or night sweats. Mastoiditis is less likely because the patient does not have any ear pain or hearing deficits. Brachial cleft cyst is less likely because the patient does not have any history of trauma to the area.

Therefore, the diagnosis is Kimura disease.

Explanation: The patient has a history of relapsing optic neuropathy and multiple cranial neuropathies, which is consistent with the diagnosis of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD). NMOSD is an autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the optic nerves and spinal cord, but can also involve other parts of the central nervous system (CNS). The mainstay of treatment for NMOSD is high-dose corticosteroids, which can help to reduce inflammation and improve symptoms. Repeating the MRI of the brain is not likely to be helpful, as the patient's initial MRI was normal and there is no evidence of new or progressive disease. Repeating the whole-body positron emission tomography scan is also not likely to be helpful, as this test is not specific for NMOSD. Repeating the testing for angiotensin-converting enzyme in serum and cerebrospinal fluid is not likely to be helpful, as this test is not specific for NMOSD and the patient's initial testing was normal. Therefore, the next best step in management is to administer high-dose corticosteroids.

Explanation:

A dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) is a surgical procedure to create an opening between the lacrimal sac and the nasal cavity. It is used to treat obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct, which is the duct that drains tears from the lacrimal sac into the nose.

The patient in this case has recurrent left eye ptosis, erythema, blepharedema, chronic discharge, and knifelike pain over the past 4 years. She has been treated with topical steroids, antibiotics, and serum tears, with temporary relief. However, she experienced recurrences of symptoms after therapy discontinuation. Additional treatment included weekly bandage contact lenses for many months, which made the left eye pain tolerable. A dacryocystogram of the left lacrimal system indicated partial dacryostenosis, but compression of the canaliculi and lacrimal sac did not exacerbate discharge. A prior computed tomography scan of the orbits and sinuses showed no abnormalities. Her visual acuity was 20/30 OD and 20/100 OS. Deep superior conjunctival fornices were noted in both eyes, and eversion of the left upper eyelid revealed a pseudomembrane of the tarsal conjunctiva. Cultures of the copious discharge demonstrated many gram-negative Serratia marcescens. She subsequently started treatment with topical prednisolone acetate, moxifloxacin, and systemic azithromycin.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with chronic dacryocystitis, which is an inflammation of the lacrimal sac. Dacryocystitis is most commonly caused by obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct. The obstruction can be caused by a number of factors, including infection, inflammation, or tumor.

The treatment of dacryocystitis depends on the cause of the obstruction. In cases of infection, antibiotics are usually used. In cases of inflammation, steroids may be used. In cases of tumor, surgery may be necessary to remove the tumor and relieve the obstruction.

In the patient's case, the dacryocystogram showed partial dacryostenosis. This suggests that the obstruction is due to inflammation or scarring of the nasolacrimal duct. The patient has also been treated with topical steroids and antibiotics, which have not provided lasting relief. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment for this patient is a dacryocystorhinostomy. A DCR will create a new opening between the lacrimal sac and the nasal cavity, which will allow tears to drain properly and relieve the patient's symptoms.

The other options are not appropriate for this patient. Option A, start treatment with systemic steroids, is not appropriate because the patient has already been treated with topical steroids without lasting relief. Option C, sweep the superior fornix, is not appropriate because this will not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Option D, perform a canaliculotomy, is not appropriate because this is a procedure that is used to treat obstruction of the lacrimal canaliculi, which is not the cause of the patient's symptoms.

The patient has a black-pigmented eyelid nodule, which is concerning for a malignant melanoma. The most appropriate management is a full-thickness eyelid resection with intraoperative control of margins. This will allow for a complete excision of the lesion with clear margins, which is essential for preventing recurrence. Incision and drainage, a corticosteroid injection, and hot compresses and an antibiotic-steroid ointment are not appropriate management for a suspected malignant melanoma. Incision and drainage may spread the tumor, a corticosteroid injection can mask the clinical appearance of the tumor, and hot compresses and an antibiotic-steroid ointment are not effective against malignant melanoma.

The patient's history and presentation are concerning for a bleeding disorder. The most common causes of bleeding disorders in adults include acquired disorders such as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), vitamin K deficiency, and liver disease, and inherited disorders such as hemophilia A and B.

The patient's laboratory findings are consistent with a bleeding disorder. The normocytic anemia is likely due to blood loss, and the normal platelet count suggests that the bleeding disorder is not due to thrombocytopenia. The low folic acid level could be a contributing factor to the bleeding disorder, but it is not the most likely cause.

The next step in the evaluation of the patient should be to order additional coagulation tests. These tests will help to determine the specific cause of the bleeding disorder. The most important tests to order are the thrombin time (TT) and the platelet function assay (PFA). The TT is a test of the extrinsic coagulation pathway, and the PFA is a test of the platelet function. These tests will help to determine whether the patient has a coagulation factor deficiency, a platelet disorder, or both.

The other options are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate next steps in the evaluation of the patient. A bone marrow biopsy is not necessary at this time, as the patient's laboratory findings do not suggest a hematologic malignancy. Prothrombin complex concentrate is a treatment for DIC, but the patient's laboratory findings do not suggest that he has DIC. Vitamin C supplementation is not a treatment for bleeding disorders.

Explanation:

The patient's POC INR is 3.7, which is above the target range of 2.0 to 3.0. This suggests that the patient's warfarin dose may need to be adjusted. However, there are several factors that can affect the accuracy of POC INR tests, including the patient's hematocrit, platelet count, and recent use of certain medications. Therefore, it is important to confirm the POC INR result with a plasma INR test before making any changes to the patient's warfarin dose.

Option A is incorrect because it would not be safe to continue the patient's current warfarin dosing without first confirming the POC INR result. Option B is incorrect because it would be too long to wait 2 weeks before repeating the INR test. Option C is incorrect because it would be too risky to reduce the patient's warfarin dose without first confirming the POC INR result.

The patient is experiencing incessant narrow complex tachycardia. He has a history of SVT and was previously treated with adenosine and direct current cardioversion. The current treatment with diltiazem drip has not terminated the arrhythmia.

Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic drug that is effective in the treatment of SVT. It is more effective than diltiazem and can be used in patients who have failed to respond to other treatments.

The other options are incorrect because:

* Option B: Repeat synchronized direct current cardioversion at 200 J is not indicated because the patient has already been cardioverted with 200 J without success.
* Option C: Switch to intravenous esmolol drip is not indicated because esmolol is a short-acting beta-blocker that is not as effective as amiodarone in the treatment of SVT.
* Option D: Stop diltiazem drip and administer intravenous verapamil is not indicated because verapamil is a calcium channel blocker that can be used in the treatment of SVT, but it is less effective than amiodarone.

In conclusion, the correct answer is: **A. Stop diltiazem drip and administer intravenous amiodarone.**

Periumbilical pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder of connective tissue characterized by the deposition of abnormal elastic fibers in the skin, eyes, and cardiovascular system. The most common presenting symptom is yellowish papules or plaques in the periumbilical region, which may be pruritic. Other findings may include angioid streaks in the retina, aortic aneurysms, and cardiovascular disease.

The diagnosis of PXE is made clinically and confirmed by skin biopsy. The characteristic histologic finding is the presence of fragmented, calcified elastic fibers in the papillary dermis.

There is no cure for PXE, but treatment is aimed at managing the complications of the disease. Angioid streaks may be treated with laser therapy, and aortic aneurysms may require surgical repair. Cardiovascular disease should be treated with lifestyle modifications and medications to lower blood pressure and cholesterol.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not describe the clinical presentation or histologic findings of PXE.

* Periumbilical pseudoxanthoma elasticum–like papillary dermal elastolysis is a rare, acquired disorder of connective tissue that clinically resembles PXE. However, it is not associated with the systemic findings of PXE.
* Elastosis perforans serpiginosa is a chronic, progressive disorder of connective tissue characterized by the formation of papules, plaques, and nodules that are often associated with ulceration. The lesions are typically located on the lower extremities, but they may occur anywhere on the body.
* Late-onset focal dermal elastosis is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder of connective tissue characterized by the deposition of abnormal elastic fibers in the dermis. The lesions are typically located on the sun-exposed areas of the skin, such as the face, neck, and hands.

Explanation:

The patient is an elderly woman with a history of an enlarging, partly infiltrated erythematous cutaneous patch localized to the periareolar area of her left breast. She has no history of cancer or chronic diseases. The physical examination did not show adenopathies, hepatosplenomegaly, or other remarkable findings. Peripheral blood test results were within normal limits. Tests for tumor markers including cancer antigen (CA) 15-3, carcinoembryonic antigen, CA 19-9, and CA 125 were unremarkable. No palpable breast masses were identifiable. Breast ultrasonography and mammography did not reveal parenchymal nodules. A local steroid therapy was administered, with no benefit. A biopsy of the skin lesion was performed, which showed a dense dermal infiltrate of cells with focal epidermis involvement and large atypical cells with scanty cytoplasm.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes Langerhans cell histiocytosis, primary cutaneous large B-cell lymphoma, leg type, Merkel cell carcinoma, and cutaneous angiosarcoma. Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disorder characterized by the proliferation of Langerhans cells, a type of white blood cell. It typically presents in children and young adults, and most often involves the skin, bones, and lymph nodes. The clinical presentation of Langerhans cell histiocytosis is variable, and can range from a solitary skin lesion to disseminated disease. The diagnosis is made based on the clinical presentation, histopathologic findings, and immunohistochemical studies. Treatment for Langerhans cell histiocytosis is typically with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.

Primary cutaneous large B-cell lymphoma, leg type is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that typically presents in older adults. It most often involves the skin of the lower extremities, but can also involve other areas of the body. The clinical presentation of primary cutaneous large B-cell lymphoma, leg type is variable, and can range from a solitary skin lesion to disseminated disease. The diagnosis is made based on the clinical presentation, histopathologic findings, and immunohistochemical studies. Treatment for primary cutaneous large B-cell lymphoma, leg type is typically with chemotherapy.

Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare, aggressive type of skin cancer that typically presents in older adults. It most often involves the sun-exposed areas of the skin, such as the face, neck, and arms. The clinical presentation of Merkel cell carcinoma is variable, and can range from a small, painless skin lesion to a large, ulcerated lesion. The diagnosis is made based on the clinical presentation, histopathologic findings, and immunohistochemical studies. Treatment for Merkel cell carcinoma is typically with surgery, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy.

Cutaneous angiosarcoma is a rare, aggressive type of skin cancer that typically presents in older adults. It most often involves the lower extremities, but can also involve other areas of the body. The clinical presentation of cutaneous angiosarcoma is variable, and can range from a small, red spot to a large, ulcerated lesion. The diagnosis is made based on the clinical presentation, histopathologic findings, and immunohistochemical studies. Treatment for cutaneous angiosarcoma is typically with surgery, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy.

In this case, the patient is an elderly woman with a history of an enlarging, partly infiltrated erythematous cutaneous patch localized to the periareolar area of her left breast. She has no history of cancer or chronic diseases. The physical examination did not show adenopathies, hepatosplenomegaly, or other remarkable findings. Peripheral blood test results were within normal limits. Tests for tumor markers including cancer antigen (CA) 15-3, carcinoembryonic antigen, CA 19-9, and CA 125 were unremarkable. No palpable breast masses were identifiable. Breast ultrasonography and mammography did not reveal parenchymal nodules. A local steroid therapy was administered, with no benefit. A biopsy of the skin lesion was performed, which showed a dense dermal infiltrate of cells with focal epidermis involvement and large atypical cells with scanty cytoplasm.

Given the patient's age, sex, and clinical presentation, the most likely diagnosis is Merkel cell carcinoma. Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare, aggressive type of skin cancer that typically presents in older adults. It most often involves the sun-exposed areas of the skin, such as the face, neck, and arms. The clinical presentation of Merkel cell carcinoma is variable, and can range from a small, painless skin lesion to a large, ulcerated lesion. The diagnosis is made based on the clinical presentation, histopathologic findings, and immunohistochemical studies. Treatment for Merkel cell carcinoma is typically with surgery, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy.

 30%|██▉       | 450/1525 [1:43:53<4:09:35, 13.93s/it]The correct answer is **C. Chorea-acanthocytosis**.

Chorea-acanthocytosis is a rare, inherited, neurodegenerative disorder characterized by chorea, orofacial dyskinesia, acanthocytes (abnormal red blood cells), and neuropsychiatric symptoms. It is caused by mutations in the chorea-acanthocytosis protein (ChAc) gene.

The patient in the case report presents with several features consistent with chorea-acanthocytosis, including involuntary orofacial movements, gait instability, cognitive decline, and acanthocytes. The patient's blood work also shows elevated CK levels, which is a common finding in chorea-acanthocytosis.

The other possible diagnoses are not consistent with the patient's presentation. Pantothenate kinase–associated neurodegeneration (PKAN) is a neurodegenerative disorder that typically presents in childhood with seizures, dystonia, and cognitive decline. Hypobetalipoproteinemia is a genetic disorder characterized by low levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Huntington disease–like 2 is a rare, inherited, neurodegenerative disorder that is clinically similar to Huntington disease.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for the patient in the case report is chorea-acanthocytosis.

Explanation:

The patient has a history of recurrent stroke and a dual-chamber pacemaker. The chest radiograph shows a ventricular lead that curves more superiorly than usual and lacks the expected indentation as it traverses the tricuspid valve. This suggests that the lead may be in the left ventricle. A transthoracic echocardiogram is the best test to confirm this and to assess for potential complications, such as lead dislodgement or thrombus formation.

Screening for thrombophilia is not indicated in this patient because he does not have any other risk factors for thromboembolism. Prolonged Holter monitoring is not indicated because the patient's stroke was not caused by atrial fibrillation. Taking serial blood cultures is not indicated because the patient does not have any signs or symptoms of infection.

In addition to a transthoracic echocardiogram, the patient should also undergo a pacemaker interrogation to assess the function of the pacemaker and leads. He should also be started on anticoagulation therapy to prevent further thromboembolism.

The patient has a history of vomiting and emaciation in her early 40s, which is a possible sign of cancer. She also has a family history of liver cancer. The vitreous opacity in her eyes is a possible sign of cancer metastasis to the eye. Aqueous humor biopsy is a procedure that can be used to diagnose cancer. It involves removing a small sample of aqueous humor, which is the fluid that fills the eye, and testing it for cancer cells. Cytometry is a technique that can be used to count and identify cells. Biochemical testing can be used to identify proteins and other molecules that are produced by cancer cells.

PPV plus pathological examination plus genetic test is not the best option because it does not provide as much information as aqueous humor biopsy. PPV is a procedure that involves removing part of the vitreous from the eye. Pathological examination is a procedure that involves examining the removed tissue under a microscope. Genetic testing is a procedure that can be used to identify genetic mutations that are associated with cancer. However, these procedures do not provide as much information about the type of cancer that the patient has as aqueous humor biopsy.

Abdominal ultrasonography is not the best option because it does not provide any information about the cancer in the patient's eyes. Abdominal ultrasonography is a procedure that uses sound waves to create images of the inside of the abdomen. It can be used to diagnose cancer in the liver, pancreas, and other organs in the abdomen. However, it cannot be used to diagnose cancer in the eyes.

Follow-up is not the best option because it does not provide any information about the cancer in the patient's eyes. Follow-up is a procedure that involves monitoring the patient's condition over time. It can be used to detect changes in the patient's condition and to determine if the patient is responding to treatment. However, it does not provide any information about the cancer in the patient's eyes.

The patient is an 80-year-old man with a history of non-Hodgkin follicular lymphoma, prostate cancer, and atrial fibrillation. He presented for routine follow-up of an elevated choroidal nevus in his right eye. On examination, he was asymptomatic with no diplopia, pain, constitutional symptoms, or blurred vision. His best-corrected visual acuity was 20/30 OU. Pupils were reactive without a relative afferent pupillary defect, extraocular motility was full, and intraocular pressures were normal. His slitlamp and fundus examination results were unremarkable aside from the choroidal nevus in his right eye, which appeared similar to previous examinations. Proptosis, resistance to retropulsion, conjunctival injection, and strabismus were notably absent. However, a new retro-orbital hypoechoic cavity causing right globe deformation was noted on B-scan ultrasonography.

The differential diagnosis for a retro-orbital hypoechoic cavity includes a variety of benign and malignant conditions, such as orbital pseudotumor, metastasis, and cavernous hemangioma. In this case, the patient's history of non-Hodgkin follicular lymphoma makes metastasis a more likely diagnosis. However, the absence of other clinical signs and symptoms, such as proptosis, resistance to retropulsion, conjunctival injection, and strabismus, makes it less likely that the lesion is malignant. Additionally, the patient's choroidal nevus has been stable for the past 2 years, which suggests that it is not likely to be the source of the new orbital lesion.

Given the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging findings, the most appropriate management is to monitor the patient with follow-up in 6 months. This will allow the clinician to assess the stability of the lesion and to determine if any further intervention is necessary.

The other options are incorrect because they are more invasive or aggressive than is necessary in this case. Performing fluorescein angiography would not provide any additional information that would change the management of the patient. Obtaining orbital imaging would be more appropriate if the patient had clinical signs and symptoms of an orbital mass, such as proptosis, resistance to retropulsion, conjunctival injection, and strabismus. Recommending a liver biopsy would be unnecessary in this case, as the patient's history and physical examination do not suggest that he has liver metastasis.

The patient in this case has a large, solitary amelanotic choroidal mass with overlying subretinal fluid. This is a concerning finding, as it could be a sign of a serious condition such as cancer. The patient also has a history of hypertension and smoking, which are risk factors for cancer.

The first step in the management of this patient is to refer her to a primary care physician for a metastatic workup. This will include a physical examination, blood tests, and imaging studies to look for evidence of cancer. If no evidence of cancer is found, the patient can then be referred to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation of the choroidal mass.

Treatment of the choroidal mass will depend on the underlying cause. If the mass is caused by cancer, treatment will likely involve surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy. If the mass is caused by a non-cancerous condition, such as sarcoidosis or tuberculosis, treatment may involve steroids or other medications.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A is incorrect because sarcoidosis and tuberculosis are rare causes of choroidal masses.
* Option B is incorrect because radiotherapy is not the first-line treatment for choroidal masses.
* Option D is incorrect because pars plana vitrectomy and biopsy are invasive procedures that should only be performed after other, less invasive options have been exhausted.

Explanation:

The patient presented with a 7-year history of a painful subungual mass of the right thumb. The lesion was initially believed to be an infection; however, results of both mycological and bacteriologic examinations were unremarkable. The patient had no notable medical history, including dyskeratosis congenita, trauma, sun exposure, radiation exposure, chemical exposure to tar or arsenic or exposure to minerals, chronic immunosuppression, or chronic infection. Physical examination revealed a subungual nodule with some exudation and crusts. The distal nail plate had been destroyed and showed onycholysis with obvious separation from the nail bed. Pertinent laboratory results (complete blood cell count, liver panel, kidney panel) were within normal limits. Lesional biopsy was also performed, which showed proliferation of atypical squamous cells invading the dermis. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of subungual squamous cell carcinoma.

Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail. It is the most common nail disorder, affecting up to 10% of the population. Onychomycosis is characterized by discoloration, thickening, and crumbling of the nail. It is usually caused by dermatophytes, which are a type of fungus that can live on the skin and nails. Onychomycosis is typically treated with antifungal medications.

Subungual verruca vulgaris is a viral infection of the nail bed. It is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). Subungual verruca vulgaris is characterized by a wart-like lesion under the nail. It is usually treated with topical or oral antiviral medications.

Subungual exostosis is a benign bone growth that occurs under the nail. It is usually caused by trauma to the nail bed. Subungual exostosis is characterized by a hard, painful lump under the nail. It is usually treated with surgery to remove the bone growth.

In conclusion, the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory results are most consistent with a diagnosis of subungual squamous cell carcinoma.

Explanation:

The patient's purpura is most likely due to cryoglobulinemia, which is a condition in which circulating immune complexes form in the blood and precipitate when the blood cools. This can lead to microvascular occlusion and tissue damage, resulting in purpura, Raynaud's phenomenon, and other symptoms.

Cryoglobulinemia is associated with a number of underlying conditions, including autoimmune diseases, infections, and malignancies. In this case, the patient has a history of lymphoma, which is a type of cancer that can cause cryoglobulinemia.

The diagnosis of cryoglobulinemia is made by measuring the level of cryoglobulins in the blood. Treatment is aimed at the underlying condition, if possible, and may also include medications to reduce the levels of cryoglobulins and prevent further tissue damage.

A. Administering empirical intravenous antibiotics is not the correct next step in this case because the patient does not have any signs or symptoms of infection.

B. Administering protein C concentrate is not the correct next step in this case because the patient does not have any signs or symptoms of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), a condition in which the body's blood clotting system becomes overactive and leads to widespread bleeding.

C. Calculating a calcium-phosphate product is not the correct next step in this case because the patient does not have any signs or symptoms of hypercalcemia, a condition in which the level of calcium in the blood is too high.

 30%|██▉       | 457/1525 [1:45:28<4:01:47, 13.58s/it]The correct answer is: D. Sarcoidosis.

Explanation:

The patient in this case presents with numerous, pink-purple dermal papules on the trunk and extremities, with preference for the extensor surfaces of the arms and legs. He also has a history of polyarticular inflammatory arthritis involving the wrists, metacarpophalangeal joints, and proximal interphalangeal joints, as well as fatigue and dyspnea on exertion. These findings are consistent with sarcoidosis, a multisystem granulomatous disease of unknown etiology.

Pulmonary function testing revealed mild restrictive disease with decreased forced vital capacity and total lung capacity. This finding is also consistent with sarcoidosis. Results of a complete blood cell count and metabolic panel; hemoglobin A1c; viral and rheumatologic panels, including HIV blood tests; chest radiograph; high-resolution chest computed tomographic scan; echocardiography; endoscopic studies; hand radiographs; and serum and urine protein electrophoresis were normal or otherwise unremarkable. These findings are not specific for any one disease, but they do not suggest any other underlying conditions that could explain the patient's symptoms.

The results of lesional skin biopsies obtained from multiple involved sites initially revealed nonspecific granulomatous dermatitis before a diagnostic biopsy was performed. This finding is consistent with sarcoidosis, which is characterized by the formation of noncaseating granulomas in the skin and other organs.

The differential diagnosis for a patient with multiple, pink-purple dermal papules includes a variety of conditions, including granuloma annulare, small-vessel vasculitis, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. However, the patient's history, physical examination, laboratory findings, and imaging studies are most consistent with sarcoidosis.

Granuloma annulare is a chronic, self-limited granulomatous skin disease that typically presents with annular or arciform lesions. It is not associated with systemic symptoms or laboratory abnormalities.

Small-vessel vasculitis is a group of disorders characterized by inflammation of small blood vessels. It can present with a variety of skin lesions, including purpura, papules, and nodules. It is often associated with systemic symptoms, such as fever, arthralgia, and fatigue.

Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is a type of skin cancer that is characterized by the proliferation of malignant T lymphocytes. It can present with a variety of skin lesions, including papules, nodules, and plaques. It is often associated with systemic symptoms, such as fever, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy.

In conclusion, the patient in this case presents with a clinical picture that is most consistent with sarcoidosis. The diagnosis of sarcoidosis is supported by the patient's history, physical examination, laboratory findings, and imaging studies.

Explanation:
Porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus is a rare, benign skin condition characterized by small, grouped, keratotic papules on the palms and soles. The papules are caused by a blockage of the eccrine sweat ducts, and they are typically asymptomatic. Treatment is not usually necessary, but topical retinoids or laser therapy may be helpful in some cases.

Punctate palmoplantar keratoderma is a group of genetic disorders characterized by thickened, scaly skin on the palms and soles. The condition is caused by mutations in genes that encode proteins involved in keratinocyte differentiation and/or epidermal barrier function. Punctate palmoplantar keratoderma can be mild or severe, and it can affect people of all ages. Treatment is aimed at relieving symptoms and preventing complications, and it may include topical medications, oral medications, and/or surgery.

Familial comedonal Darier disease is a rare, inherited skin disorder characterized by comedones (blackheads and whiteheads) on the face, trunk, and extremities. The condition is caused by mutations in the DAR gene, which encodes a protein involved in keratinocyte differentiation. Familial comedonal Darier disease can be mild or severe, and it can affect people of all ages. Treatment is aimed at relieving symptoms and preventing complications, and it may include topical medications, oral medications, and/or laser therapy.

Nevus comedonicus is a rare, benign skin condition characterized by comedones (blackheads and whiteheads) on the face, trunk, and extremities. The condition is caused by a blockage of the hair follicles, and it is typically asymptomatic. Treatment is not usually necessary, but topical retinoids or laser therapy may be helpful in some cases.

In the case presented, the patient has a history of asymptomatic, punctate, keratotic papules localized to the right palm and right third proximal finger that had been present since age 2 years. The papules are grouped and circumscribed, firm, skin-colored, 1- to 3-mm papules with a central punctate dark core. A 4-mm punch biopsy from a papule on the palm was performed, and the histopathologic findings showed dilated follicular infundibulum with keratinous core and absent hair shaft. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus. The other three options are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation and histopathologic findings.

Explanation:

The patient's syncope is likely due to high-grade AV block, which is a known side effect of metoprolol tartrate. Discontinuation of metoprolol tartrate is the first-line treatment for AV block. If the patient's syncope resolves after discontinuation of metoprolol tartrate, then no further treatment is necessary. If the patient's syncope persists after discontinuation of metoprolol tartrate, then a permanent pacemaker may be necessary.

Options A, C, and D are incorrect because they would not address the underlying cause of the patient's syncope. Implanting a permanent pacemaker would not be necessary if the patient's syncope resolves after discontinuation of metoprolol tartrate. Administering oral theophylline would not be helpful because AV block is not a reversible arrhythmia. Switching ticagrelor to clopidogrel would not be helpful because AV block is not a drug-induced arrhythmia.

Explanation:

The patient has a history of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, which is a genetic disorder that is associated with a number of congenital anomalies, including thymic aplasia or hypoplasia. Thymic aplasia or hypoplasia can lead to the development of an ectopic thymus, which is a thymus that is located in an abnormal position, such as in the neck. The patient's presentation is consistent with an ectopic thymus, as he has a neck mass that is located in the retropharyngeal, parapharyngeal, and carotid spaces. The mass is also mildly enhancing on MRI, which is a finding that is consistent with thymic tissue. Additionally, the patient's biopsy results reveal a polymorphic population of lymphocytes, fibroadipose tissue, and a concentric island of squamous cells with central keratinization. These findings are also consistent with thymic tissue.

Lipomas are benign tumors of adipose tissue that are typically located in the subcutaneous tissue. Branchial cleft cysts are developmental anomalies that are formed from remnants of the branchial arches. Rhabdomyosarcomas are malignant tumors of skeletal muscle. All of these tumors can occur in the neck, but they are not associated with 22q11.2 deletion syndrome.

The patient has bilateral retinal detachments, which are a medical emergency. The goal of treatment is to reattach the retina as soon as possible to prevent permanent vision loss. Intravitreal triamcinolone is a corticosteroid that can be injected into the vitreous cavity to reduce inflammation and edema. It is a safe and effective treatment for retinal detachment, and it is the first-line treatment for most cases.

Quantiferon and rapid plasma reagin tests are used to screen for tuberculosis. Chest radiography is used to diagnose tuberculosis. Human leukocyte antigen genotyping is used to determine a person's risk for developing certain diseases. These tests are not relevant to the patient's current condition, and they would not help to improve her outcome.

A pars plana vitrectomy is a surgical procedure that is used to remove vitreous from the eye. It is a more invasive procedure than intravitreal triamcinolone, and it is reserved for cases where intravitreal steroids are not effective. In this case, the patient has bilateral retinal detachments, which is a medical emergency. Intravitreal triamcinolone is the first-line treatment for most cases of retinal detachment, and it is the most appropriate treatment for this patient.

The patient in this case has bilateral limbus-sparing conjunctivitis, an erythematous chest rash, lip blistering, and worsening sore throat. He is also febrile and has a history of allergies to β-lactam, macrolide, and cephalosporin antibiotics. These findings are consistent with Stevens-Johnson syndrome, a severe allergic reaction to medications that can cause life-threatening skin and mucous membrane lesions.

The first step in treating Stevens-Johnson syndrome is to discontinue the offending medication. In this case, the patient should stop taking the ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. He should also avoid all medications that have been associated with Stevens-Johnson syndrome, such as penicillins, sulfonamides, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

In addition to discontinuing the offending medication, treatment for Stevens-Johnson syndrome may include supportive care, such as intravenous fluids and electrolytes, and topical antibiotics to prevent secondary infection. In severe cases, corticosteroids may be used to reduce inflammation.

The prognosis for Stevens-Johnson syndrome varies depending on the severity of the reaction. Most patients make a full recovery, but some may have long-term complications, such as scarring, chronic eye problems, and hearing loss.

The other possible answers are incorrect because they would not be appropriate treatment for Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Answer A, recommending systemic corticosteroids, is incorrect because corticosteroids can worsen the skin lesions in Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Answer B, initiating a course of topical ophthalmic antibiotics and corticosteroids, is incorrect because the patient does not have bacterial conjunctivitis. Answer C, performing amniotic membrane transplantation, is incorrect because amniotic membrane transplantation is not a standard treatment for Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

The patient has bilateral foveal lesions, which could be caused by a variety of conditions, including age-related macular degeneration, central serous chorioretinopathy, and multiple evanescent white dot syndrome. In order to determine the cause of the lesions, it is important to obtain a detailed medical and personal history, including drug history. This information will help the doctor to narrow down the differential diagnosis and recommend the appropriate treatment.

The other options are incorrect because they are not necessary at this stage in the evaluation. Laboratory testing may be helpful in some cases, but it is not necessary in all cases. Dye angiography is a specialized imaging test that is used to diagnose certain eye conditions, but it is not necessary in this case. Treatment with antiviral drugs is only necessary if the lesions are caused by a viral infection, which is not the most likely diagnosis in this case.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Obtain an in-depth medical and personal history, including drug history. This information will help the doctor to determine the cause of the lesions and recommend the appropriate treatment.

Explanation:

The patient is an 18-month-old girl with an unremarkable medical history who was referred to ocular oncology from pediatric ophthalmology for an intraocular mass near the optic nerve. Her parents noticed the left eye turning out for the past year. On examination, she fixed and followed with her right eye but not with the left, with 5.0-diopter exophoria at near in the left eye. Penlight examination results showed left leukocoria. Intraocular pressure and motility were normal bilaterally. On subsequent examination under anesthesia, the left optic nerve was obscured by a whitish mass. While the optic nerve itself was obscured, a pigmented crescent could be seen surrounding it. Ultrasonography results demonstrated an elevated retinal mass overlying an excavated optic nerve head. A small focus of hyperechogenicity was noted at the optic nerve head, consistent with calcium. Fluorescein angiography results demonstrated staining of the central whitish mass, which was obscuring the underlying retinal vessels. On fluorescein angiography results, no vessels were seen within the central whitish mass itself.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes retinoblastoma, a malignant tumor of the retina that is the most common intraocular malignancy in children. Other possible diagnoses include astrocytic hamartoma, a benign tumor of the retina, and a metastatic tumor from another site.

The next step in the management of this patient is to obtain an orbital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to evaluate for optic nerve invasion and a brain MRI to assess for a pineal gland tumor. If the MRI findings are consistent with retinoblastoma, the patient will then need to undergo chemotherapy.

Observation for the eye and MRI and magnetic resonance angiography of the head (B) is not the correct answer because it does not address the possibility of optic nerve invasion or a pineal gland tumor. Careful examination of the skin and genetic testing of genes on chromosomes 9 and 16 (C) is not the correct answer because these tests are not typically used to diagnose retinoblastoma. Enucleation (D) is not the correct answer because it is a surgical procedure that is only performed in cases of very advanced retinoblastoma.

Erosive osteoarthritis is a type of osteoarthritis that causes erosions of the bone and cartilage in the joints. It is most common in the hands, knees, and hips. Metastatic bone disease is a condition in which cancer cells spread to the bones. It can cause pain, swelling, and fractures. Seronegative rheumatoid arthritis is a type of rheumatoid arthritis that does not cause the production of rheumatoid factor, an antibody that is found in the blood of most people with rheumatoid arthritis.

The patient in this case has a history of metastatic human papillomavirus–positive cervical adenocarcinoma. She presented with multiple joint deformities, which started 1 month after the initiation of nivolumab. Nivolumab is a monoclonal antibody that is used to treat cancer. It works by blocking the action of a protein called PD-1, which helps cancer cells evade the immune system.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with nivolumab-induced inflammatory arthritis. Nivolumab can cause a variety of autoimmune side effects, including arthritis. The patient's symptoms began shortly after starting nivolumab, and she has no other known risk factors for arthritis. Her physical examination findings are consistent with an inflammatory arthritis, and her blood tests show no evidence of other autoimmune diseases. The imaging studies show multifocal osseous erosions, which are a characteristic finding of nivolumab-induced inflammatory arthritis.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is nivolumab-induced inflammatory arthritis.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is concerning for multiple myeloma, a plasma cell neoplasm characterized by the production of monoclonal immunoglobulins. The presence of proteinuria and soft tissue masses is highly suggestive of this diagnosis. Serum protein electrophoresis and serum free light chains assay are the most sensitive and specific tests for the diagnosis of multiple myeloma. A bone scan is not necessary in the initial evaluation of a patient with suspected multiple myeloma, as it is not specific for this diagnosis. Methotrexate is a chemotherapy agent that is used to treat multiple myeloma, but it is not the first-line treatment. Temporal artery biopsy is a procedure that is used to diagnose giant cell arteritis, a vasculitis that can cause headache, jaw claudication, and vision loss. This diagnosis is not consistent with the patient's presentation.

Explanation:

A laboratory-based glucose test is not the best option in this case because it is not a sensitive test for diabetes. A POC HbA1c test is a more sensitive test that can be performed in the office. It is a good option for patients who are concerned about having diabetes because it can provide a quick and accurate result.

A laboratory-based HbA1c test is also an option, but it is not as convenient as a POC test. It is also more expensive.

Do not perform glycemic testing because it is not indicated for this patient. This is not the correct answer because the patient has expressed concern about having diabetes. It is important to test his glycemic status to rule out diabetes.

Explanation:

Cutaneous pseudolymphoma is a non-neoplastic skin condition that can mimic lymphoma. It is characterized by the presence of small, red, scaly papules or nodules. The condition is most common in middle-aged and elderly adults.

The diagnosis of cutaneous pseudolymphoma is made based on the clinical presentation and the results of a biopsy. The biopsy specimen will show a proliferation of lymphocytes in the skin. However, the lymphocytes will not be malignant.

The treatment of cutaneous pseudolymphoma is usually not necessary. However, if the condition is causing significant discomfort or disfigurement, it can be treated with topical steroids or other medications.

The other options are incorrect because:

* Ichthyosiform mycosis fungoides is a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. It is a rare, aggressive cancer that can spread to other parts of the body.
* Ichthyosis vulgaris is a genetic disorder that causes the skin to become dry, scaly, and thick. It is not a cancerous condition.
* Atopic dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that causes itching, redness, and scaling. It is not a cancerous condition.
* Large plaque parapsoriasis is a chronic skin condition that is characterized by the appearance of large, scaly patches on the skin. It is not a cancerous condition.

Explanation:

Annular atrophic lichen planus (AALP) is a chronic, autoimmune skin disease characterized by annular, atrophic plaques with central atrophy and slightly raised borders. It is most commonly seen on the lower extremities, but can also occur on the trunk, arms, and face. The exact cause of AAPL is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder.

The most common symptoms of AAPL are pruritus (itching), burning, and tingling. The lesions are typically small, round, or oval, and have a slightly raised border with central atrophy. They may be white, pink, or brown, and may be covered with scale. In some cases, the lesions may coalesce to form larger plaques.

AALP is typically diagnosed based on the clinical appearance of the lesions. A skin biopsy may be performed to confirm the diagnosis. There is no cure for AAPL, but treatment can help to relieve the symptoms and improve the appearance of the lesions. Treatment options include topical corticosteroids, oral corticosteroids, and phototherapy.

The patient in the case presented with atrophic annular plaques on the breasts following augmentation surgery. These findings are consistent with AAPL. The patient's history of breast augmentation surgery is a risk factor for AAPL. The patient's symptoms of pruritus and burning are also consistent with AAPL. The clinical appearance of the lesions, which are small, round or oval, with a slightly raised border and central atrophy, is also consistent with AAPL. The patient's skin biopsy findings of lichenoid inflammation and subepidermal fibrosis are also consistent with AAPL.

The other options are incorrect because they do not fit the patient's clinical presentation. Erythema annulare centrifugum is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease characterized by annular, erythematous plaques with central clearing. Porokeratosis is a chronic, inherited skin disease characterized by small, circumscribed, hyperkeratotic papules. Granuloma annulare is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease characterized by small, annular, erythematous papules with central clearing.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is most consistent with a diagnosis of spinal cord glioma. The patient is a middle-aged woman with a 2-month history of progressive lower extremity weakness, sensory loss, and sphincter dysfunction. On examination, she has a right greater than left pyramidal weakness, brisk reflexes and right ankle clonus, as well as a sensory level to pinprick at T6. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the total spine with and without gadolinium shows a long-segment, expansile T2 hyperintense lesion spanning C5 through T12 and involving greater than two-thirds of the cord diameter. The spinal cord is mildly diffusely swollen without an appreciated focal mass. Associated extensive ill-defined enhancement of the spinal cord spanning T3 through T9.

A postinfectious myelopathy is a rare neurological disorder that can occur after a viral infection, such as the Epstein-Barr virus or the varicella zoster virus. It is characterized by a subacute or chronic onset of progressive weakness, sensory loss, and bladder and bowel dysfunction. The diagnosis is made based on the clinical presentation and the results of MRI, which typically shows a diffusely swollen spinal cord. Treatment is supportive and may include corticosteroids, plasmapheresis, or immunoglobulin therapy.

A toxic myelopathy is a neurological disorder that can be caused by exposure to a variety of toxins, including heavy metals, drugs, and environmental pollutants. It is characterized by a subacute or chronic onset of progressive weakness, sensory loss, and bladder and bowel dysfunction. The diagnosis is made based on the clinical presentation and the results of laboratory testing, which may show elevated levels of the toxin in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid. Treatment is supportive and may include removal of the toxin from the environment, chelation therapy, or plasmapheresis.

A spinal dural arteriovenous fistula (SDAVF) is a rare vascular anomaly that occurs when there is an abnormal connection between an artery and a vein in the dura mater, the outermost layer of the meninges. It is characterized by a subacute or chronic onset of progressive headache, weakness, and sensory loss. The diagnosis is made based on the clinical presentation and the results of MRI, which typically shows a dilated vein in the spinal canal. Treatment is surgical, with the goal of obliterating the fistula.

In the case of the patient described above, the most likely diagnosis is a spinal cord glioma. This is supported by the patient's clinical presentation, which includes progressive lower extremity weakness, sensory loss, and sphincter dysfunction; the results of the MRI, which show a long-segment, expansile T2 hyperintense lesion spanning C5 through T12 and involving greater than two-thirds of the cord diameter; and the lack of evidence to support other possible diagnoses, such as a postinfectious myelopathy or a toxic myelopathy.

Explanation:

The patient in this case has a history of exertional dyspnea and neck fullness. Examination of the jugular venous contour with the patient sitting upright at 90° shows a prominent V wave, which is a sign of right atrial hypertension. Auscultatory findings at the left lower sternal border show a diastolic sound, which is a sign of tricuspid regurgitation. Abdominal examination reveals an enlarged, pulsatile liver with smooth edges palpable 4 cm below the costal margin. Electrocardiography shows resting abnormalities (rightward axis and inferolateral T-wave inversions). Posteroanterior chest radiography shows normal heart size and clear lungs. Transthoracic echocardiography shows normal left ventricular size and function without valvular abnormalities.

Based on these findings, the most likely diagnosis is tricuspid regurgitation. Transesophageal echocardiography is the most accurate test for diagnosing tricuspid regurgitation. It is also the best test for determining the severity of the regurgitation and for evaluating the right ventricle. Right and left heart catheterization can be used to measure the pressure in the right atrium and ventricle, but it is not as accurate as transesophageal echocardiography for diagnosing tricuspid regurgitation. Magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium enhancement is not a useful test for diagnosing tricuspid regurgitation. Liver biopsy is not necessary in this case, as the patient's liver function tests are normal.

Therefore, the next best step in the management of this patient is to perform transesophageal echocardiography.

 31%|███       | 473/1525 [1:49:07<4:09:14, 14.21s/it]The correct answer is A. Perform percutaneous biopsy of the mass.

The patient is a 43-year-old African American man with a nontender, self-palpated mass in his left breast. He has hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and obesity and is a current smoker. His medications include carvedilol, furosemide, lisinopril, metformin, and aspirin but no testosterone or herbal supplements. Family history is significant for a sister with brain cancer, diagnosed in her 40s. On physical examination, his vital signs are within normal limits; his body mass index, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared, is 53. His left nipple is retracted. At the 2-o’clock position of the left breast, 3 cm from the nipple, there was a 3.5 × 3.0–cm firm mass. The right breast was normal without masses, and there was no palpable axillary lymphadenopathy. He underwent a bilateral diagnostic mammogram, which showed a partially obscured mass in the left upper outer quadrant with linear extension to the nipple (Figure, left panel). Targeted ultrasound showed a 2.0 × 1.6 × 1.6–cm irregular hypoechoic mass (Figure, right panel).

The next step in the management of this patient is to perform a percutaneous biopsy of the mass. This is the most accurate way to determine the nature of the mass and to rule out malignancy. If the biopsy shows that the mass is malignant, the patient will need to undergo further treatment, such as surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy. If the biopsy shows that the mass is benign, the patient may be able to be monitored without further treatment.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Excising the mass without a biopsy would not be accurate and could potentially lead to the spread of cancer. Ordering a breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would not be helpful in this case, as MRI is not as accurate as biopsy for diagnosing breast cancer. Sending hormonal evaluation for gynecomastia is not appropriate in this case, as the patient does not have any symptoms of gynecomastia.

 31%|███       | 474/1525 [1:49:21<4:11:03, 14.33s/it]The answer is: **D. Stevens-Johnson syndrome**.

Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a rare but serious disorder that affects the skin and mucous membranes. It is characterized by the sudden onset of a fever and a rash that often begins on the face and spreads to other parts of the body. The rash can be severe and can cause blisters, ulcers, and peeling of the skin. Stevens-Johnson syndrome can also affect the eyes, mouth, throat, genitals, and anus. In severe cases, it can lead to life-threatening complications, such as pneumonia, sepsis, and multiorgan failure.

The exact cause of Stevens-Johnson syndrome is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune reaction to a medication or infection. The most common triggers are medications such as antibiotics, anticonvulsants, and sulfonamides. Stevens-Johnson syndrome can also be caused by viral infections, such as herpes simplex virus and Epstein-Barr virus.

There is no cure for Stevens-Johnson syndrome, but treatment can help to relieve symptoms and prevent complications. Treatment typically involves stopping the medication that caused the reaction, providing supportive care, and treating any secondary infections. In severe cases, hospitalization may be necessary.

The prognosis for Stevens-Johnson syndrome varies depending on the severity of the reaction. Most people recover completely, but some may have long-term complications, such as scarring, vision problems, and hearing loss. Stevens-Johnson syndrome can be fatal in up to 10% of cases.

In the case described in the question, the patient has a fever, rash, and lesions on the mucosa of the oral cavity, lips, and penis. He also has hemorrhage lesions of the eye sclera. These findings are consistent with Stevens-Johnson syndrome. The patient's history of a similar but less severe clinical event 5 years previously is also consistent with Stevens-Johnson syndrome, as this condition is known to recur in some people.

The other possible diagnoses in the question are bullous pemphigus, toxic epidermal necrolysis (Lyell syndrome), and multiforme erythema. Bullous pemphigus is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes blisters on the skin and mucous membranes. Toxic epidermal necrolysis is a rare, life-threatening disorder that causes the skin to peel off in large sheets. Multiforme erythema is a rash that can be caused by a variety of factors, including infections, medications, and certain diseases.

The patient's symptoms are most consistent with Stevens-Johnson syndrome. The other possible diagnoses are less likely, given the patient's history and presentation.

 31%|███       | 475/1525 [1:49:34<4:01:42, 13.81s/it]Answer: C. Papillary adenocarcinoma
Explanation:
The patient is a healthy Asian man in his 20s who presented with a 5-month history of progressive bilateral nasal obstruction. He also complained of recurrent epistaxis. He had no notable medical history except stable asthma. On physical examination, nasopharyngoscopy showed a pedunculated mass with a smooth mucosal surface arising from the roof of the nasopharynx. Computed tomographic (CT) imaging revealed a midline, well-defined, pedunculated polypoid lesion with areas of calcifications in the nasopharynx, measuring approximately 1.2 × 1.5 × 2.0 cm. An endoscopic resection via retrovelar approach using a 70-degree endoscope combined with transnasal approach was performed under general anesthesia. The mass was completely resected with its stalk and with adequate surgical margin. Histopathological results showed that the tumor cells were arranged in papillary structures with fibrovascular cores and these cells also had nuclear grooves. Results of other investigations after surgery were negative for cancer, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the neck and thyroid ultrasonography. In addition, no residual tumor or systemic metastasis was observed on positron emission tomography (PET)-CT results. There was no evidence of recurrence at 12-month postoperative follow-up.

The most likely diagnosis is papillary adenocarcinoma of the nasopharynx. This is supported by the patient's clinical presentation, imaging findings, and histopathological results. Papillary adenocarcinoma is a rare type of cancer that typically occurs in the nasopharynx. It is characterized by the growth of papillary (finger-like) projections of tumor cells. The tumor cells often have nuclear grooves, which are characteristic of this type of cancer. Papillary adenocarcinoma is usually slow-growing and has a good prognosis with early diagnosis and treatment.

Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of cancer that occurs in the nasopharynx. However, it is not typically associated with calcifications. Lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymphatic system. It is not typically associated with papillary structures or nuclear grooves. Chondrosarcoma is a type of cancer that affects cartilage. It is not typically associated with the nasopharynx.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for the patient is papillary adenocarcinoma of the nasopharynx. This is supported by the patient's clinical presentation, imaging findings, and histopathological results.

 31%|███       | 476/1525 [1:49:50<4:14:27, 14.55s/it]Answer: C. Pemphigus vulgaris

Explanation:

Pemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune disease that causes the skin and mucous membranes to blister and peel. It is characterized by the presence of circulating autoantibodies against the desmoglein 1 and desmoglein 3 proteins, which are found in the intercellular junctions of epithelial cells. This results in the separation of the cells and the formation of blisters.

The patient in the case presented with a history of painful and pruritic ulcerative cutaneous lesions involving his back, nose, lips, and mucosal lesions involving his oral cavity and oropharynx. The lesions initially only involved his lips and nasal bridge, and appeared 5 months prior while he was living on a ranch in Mexico. The lesions did not respond to treatment with an unknown oral antibiotic. His medical history included hypertension treated with captopril and a remote history of psoriasis. Physical examination demonstrated several dry, crusted skin lesions with blistering and ulceration, and shallow erythematous ulcerations of his oral mucosa. Internal medicine, otolaryngology, and dermatology departments were consulted. Results of flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy demonstrated erythematous and ulcerative lesions with surrounding leukoplakia involving the base of tongue, glossoepiglottic fold, lingual and laryngeal surfaces of the epiglottis, and aryepiglottic folds. A QuantiFERON-TB Gold test was obtained, and results were found to be positive. Serum antigen testing for blastomyces, histoplasmosis, syphilis, HIV, hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, human herpesvirus 6, cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, varicella zoster virus, human polyomavirus 2, and West Nile virus were performed, and all results were found to be negative. A biopsy of the skin lesion was obtained from the edge of the lesion found on the patient’s back. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay serological testing was subsequently performed, and results demonstrated elevated levels of antidesmoglein 1 immunoglobulin G (IgG) and antidesmoglein 3 IgG.

The clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and histopathologic findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris. The patient's history of living in Mexico is also a risk factor for pemphigus vulgaris, as the disease is more common in Latin America.

Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that can present with ulcerative lesions, but it is not typically associated with blistering or mucosal involvement. Paracoccidioidomycosis is a fungal infection that can cause skin lesions, but it is not typically associated with blistering or mucosal involvement. Lupus vulgaris is a form of cutaneous tuberculosis that can present with ulcerative lesions, but it is not typically associated with blistering or mucosal involvement.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for the patient in the case is pemphigus vulgaris.

Explanation:

Eosinophilic sialodochitis is a rare chronic inflammatory condition of the salivary glands that is characterized by the presence of eosinophils in the saliva and the ducts of the salivary glands. The most common symptom is recurrent pain and swelling of the salivary glands, usually the parotid glands. Other symptoms may include dry mouth, fever, and facial pain. The diagnosis is made by biopsy of the salivary gland. Treatment is usually with steroids, which can be given orally or by injection. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the affected gland.

In the case presented, the patient has a 2-year history of recurring left submandibular gland swelling and pain. She reported no associated fevers, chills, dryness of mouth, nausea, vomiting, dysphagia or odynophagia. Her medical history was unremarkable except for allergic rhinitis. On physical examination, she had slight enlargement of the left submandibular gland, which was not tender on palpation. Ultrasonography results revealed normal submandibular and parotid glands bilaterally without any mass or calcifications. Blood examinations and basic metabolic panel results were all within normal limits. Sialoendoscopy of the left submandibular duct was performed under general anesthesia. The patient was found to have a cast at the opening of the Wharton duct, which was removed and sent for pathological evaluation (Figure). Using sialoendoscopy with saline irrigation, the entire duct was examined up to the hilum of the gland. No stones were noted. There were areas of mild partial webbing without complete obstruction. The areas of webbing were broken up with irrigation, and at the end of the procedure steroid instillation and irrigation were performed. There were no complications during or after the procedure.

The histopathological findings of the cast showed numerous eosinophils, which is consistent with the diagnosis of eosinophilic sialodochitis. The other possible diagnoses, IgG4-related sialadenitis, Kimura disease, and angiolymphoid hyperplasia with eosinophilia, do not typically present with a cast at the opening of the salivary duct.

The patient in this case has developed graft-host interface haze after Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK). This is a rare but serious complication of DSAEK, and it is often caused by infection. The patient's clinical presentation, including her history of right eye pain and photophobia, her corrected-distance visual acuity of 20/60 OD, her slitlamp examination findings of a right inflamed conjunctiva with circumcorneal hyperemia, a 2 mm × 2 mm epithelial defect with a small infiltrate at the temporal cornea, 2+ cells in the anterior chamber with a 1-mm hypopyon, and a peculiar graft-host interface haze with crisscross pattern, and the results of her microbiological investigations, including donor rim culture, all suggest that she has an infectious keratitis.

The most likely cause of the patient's infection is a bacterial infection. This is because bacteria are the most common cause of infectious keratitis after DSAEK. Other possible causes of the patient's infection include fungal infections and viral infections. However, these are less likely causes in this case.

The initial treatment for a bacterial keratitis after DSAEK is usually a combination of topical and systemic antibiotics. However, in this case, the patient has not responded to treatment with topical cefuroxime, 5%, and gentamicin, 1.5%, drops every hour around the clock. This suggests that she has a more serious infection that is not responding to the initial treatment.

In cases of severe bacterial keratitis after DSAEK, it is often necessary to remove the DSAEK graft and send it for microbiological culture and sensitivity testing. This will allow the surgeon to select the most appropriate antibiotic for treatment. In addition, removing the graft will allow the eye to heal from the infection.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Option A, starting a broad-spectrum oral antibiotic such as moxifloxacin, is not appropriate because the patient has already been treated with topical antibiotics without improvement. Option B, starting topical and systemic antifungal treatment, is not appropriate because the patient's clinical presentation and the results of her microbiological investigations do not suggest that she has a fungal infection. Option C, restarting topical steroid drops, is not appropriate because steroids can suppress the immune system and make the infection worse.

Explanation:
The patient in the case presented with multifocal choroidal lesions. The most likely diagnosis is multifocal choroiditis and panuveitis (MCP), a noninfectious inflammatory condition of the choroid and uvea. MCP is associated with HLA-A29, a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene. HLA-A29 is a genetic marker that is found in about 50% of people with MCP. HLA-A29 testing can be used to diagnose MCP and to monitor the response to treatment.

Empirical steroids are not recommended for the treatment of MCP. Steroids can worsen the inflammation in MCP and can lead to complications such as cataracts and glaucoma.

Interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) is a test that is used to measure the body's response to interferon-γ. IGRA is not a reliable test for diagnosing MCP.

Observation is not a recommended treatment for MCP. MCP is a progressive disease that can lead to vision loss. Treatment with corticosteroids is recommended to reduce inflammation and prevent vision loss.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is to order HLA-A29 testing.

The patient's presentation is concerning for a mass lesion in the orbit or brain that is compressing the optic nerve. The most common cause of this is a pituitary adenoma, which is a benign tumor that arises from the pituitary gland. Pituitary adenomas can cause a variety of symptoms, including blurry vision, headache, and vision loss.

To rule out a mass lesion, the next step in management is to order a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain and orbit. This will allow the physician to visualize the brain and orbit and look for any abnormalities. If a mass lesion is found, the physician will need to determine the size and location of the lesion, as well as the type of tumor. The treatment for a pituitary adenoma will depend on the size and location of the tumor, as well as the patient's age and overall health.

The other options are incorrect because they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. A peripheral iridotomy is a procedure that is used to treat angle-closure glaucoma. It is not indicated in this case because the patient does not have glaucoma. A clear lens extraction is a procedure that is used to remove a cataract. It is not indicated in this case because the patient does not have a cataract. Patient education and observation are important, but they are not the only steps that need to be taken in this case. The patient needs to have an MRI scan to rule out a mass lesion.

Explanation:

The patient's history and examination findings are concerning for a mass lesion in the left orbit. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits is the best test to evaluate for a mass lesion in the orbit. MRI is a non-invasive test that uses magnetic fields and radio waves to create detailed images of the inside of the body. It is the most sensitive test for detecting tumors and other abnormalities in the orbit.

Applanation tonometry is a test to measure the pressure inside the eye. It is not necessary in this case because the patient does not have any symptoms of increased eye pressure, such as headache, blurred vision, or seeing halos around lights.

Serum thyroid testing is a test to measure the levels of thyroid hormones in the blood. It is not necessary in this case because the patient does not have any symptoms of thyroid disease, such as fatigue, weight gain, or hair loss.

Computed angiography of the head (CTA) is a test to evaluate the blood vessels in the head. It is not necessary in this case because the patient does not have any symptoms of a stroke or other cerebrovascular disease.

MG is an autoimmune disease that causes the immune system to attack the acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction, which is the point where a nerve impulse is transmitted to a muscle. This causes muscle weakness, which can be mild to severe.

The patient in the case presented with diplopia, myalgia, and weakness of proximal muscle groups. These symptoms are consistent with MG. The elevated acetylcholine receptor binding and modulating antibody levels are also consistent with MG.

Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation of the peripheral nerves. This can lead to weakness, numbness, and tingling in the arms and legs. GBS is not caused by an autoimmune attack on the acetylcholine receptors, so the patient's symptoms are not consistent with GBS.

Lambert-Eaton syndrome (LES) is an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation of the nerves. This can lead to weakness, fatigue, and problems with sweating. LES is not caused by an autoimmune attack on the acetylcholine receptors, so the patient's symptoms are not consistent with LES.

Miller Fisher syndrome (MFS) is a rare neurological disorder that is characterized by ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and areflexia. MFS is not caused by an autoimmune attack on the acetylcholine receptors, so the patient's symptoms are not consistent with MFS.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for the patient in the case presented is MG.

The patient's presentation is consistent with metastasis to the choroid, which is a layer of tissue in the back of the eye. Choroidal metastasis is a rare but serious complication of cancer, and it can lead to rapid and irreversible vision loss. The most common cause of choroidal metastasis is breast cancer, followed by lung cancer and melanoma.

The diagnosis of choroidal metastasis is made with a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head and orbits. This test can show the presence of tumors in the choroid and other parts of the eye. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, treatment options include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and photodynamic therapy.

In the case of this patient, the most appropriate next step is to obtain an MRI of the head and orbits to confirm the diagnosis of choroidal metastasis. If the diagnosis is confirmed, the patient can then be referred to a specialist for further treatment.

The other options are incorrect because they are not appropriate for the patient's presentation. Option A, initiating high-dose intravenous corticosteroid medication, is not effective for treating choroidal metastasis. Option B, injecting intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) into both eyes, is a treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration, but it is not effective for choroidal metastasis. Option D, stopping capecitabine and trastuzumab, is not appropriate because these medications are not known to cause choroidal metastasis.

Explanation:

The patient has a history of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, which is a surgical procedure that reduces the size of the stomach. This can lead to malabsorption of nutrients, including iron and vitamin B12. The patient's symptoms, such as fatigue, loss of appetite, and hair loss, are consistent with both iron and vitamin B12 deficiency. The patient's laboratory results also support this diagnosis. The patient's hemoglobin is low, which is a sign of anemia. The patient's mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is also low, which is a sign of microcytic anemia. Microcytic anemia can be caused by iron deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency, or folate deficiency. The patient's serum iron level is low, which is a sign of iron deficiency. The patient's serum vitamin B12 level is also low, which is a sign of vitamin B12 deficiency. The patient's serum folate level is normal, which rules out folate deficiency as a cause of the patient's anemia. Therefore, the patient most likely has both iron and vitamin B12 deficiencies.

A. This patient has iron deficiency anemia in the setting of polycystic ovarian syndrome.

This is incorrect because the patient does not have any symptoms of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a hormonal disorder that can cause infertility, irregular periods, and excessive hair growth. The patient does not have any of these symptoms.

B. This patient has B12 deficiency.

This is incorrect because the patient also has iron deficiency. B12 deficiency can cause anemia, but it does not cause the other symptoms that the patient is experiencing.

D. This patient has anemia of chronic disease.

This is incorrect because the patient does not have any chronic diseases. Anemia of chronic disease is a type of anemia that occurs in people with chronic diseases such as cancer, heart disease, or kidney disease. The patient does not have any of these diseases.

Explanation: The patient in this case has a history of rectal carcinoma with lymph node metastasis. She is now presenting with a painful skin eruption on the vulva of 2 months’ duration. The physical examination reveals well-defined, firm, indurated plaques on the vulva with nodules on the surface. A biopsy of the left vulva was performed, which showed a mucinous adenocarcinoma. This is consistent with a diagnosis of cutaneous metastatic mucinous carcinoma from rectal carcinoma.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Primary mucinous adenocarcinoma is a rare type of cancer that can occur in the vulva. However, it is not typically associated with a history of rectal carcinoma.
* Invasive extramammary Paget disease is a rare type of cancer that can occur in the skin. It is typically found on the nipple or areola, but it can also occur on the vulva. However, it is not typically associated with a history of rectal carcinoma.

The patient has a firm plaque on the occipital scalp with superimposed papules, which is consistent with a diagnosis of sclerotic neurofibroma. Sclerotic neurofibromas are benign tumors of the peripheral nerve sheath that are characterized by dense fibrosis and proliferation of perineural fibroblasts. They are often associated with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple neurofibromas, cafe-au-lait spots, and Lisch nodules.

The patient in the case does not have any of the other features of NF1, such as cafe-au-lait spots or Lisch nodules. Therefore, the diagnosis of familial cutaneous collagenoma (B), shagreen patch (C), or fibrous cephalic plaque (D) is less likely.

In addition, the biopsy specimens from the patient's papules show diffuse dense fibrosis, capillary vessel proliferation with some ectasia, and perifollicular fibroblastic proliferation. These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of sclerotic neurofibroma.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for the patient is sclerotic neurofibroma.

Explanation:

The patient presented with multiple atrophic papules and plaques on his trunk and extremities that developed gradually over several years. Although most were asymptomatic, the patient was concerned about the ongoing appearance of new lesions and the associated pain that some lesions were causing. His medical history was significant for adenosine deaminase–deficient severe combined immunodeficiency (ADA-SCID), which had been managed since childhood with twice weekly intramuscular injections of pegademase bovine enzyme replacement, thrice weekly trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for Pneumocystis prophylaxis, and monthly infusions of intravenous immunoglobulin. Physical examination revealed 9 smooth-surfaced, skin-colored to hyperpigmented, 0.5- to 1.5-cm atrophic papules and plaques that exhibited the buttonhole sign on palpation. The multicentric lesions were located on the left knee, left thigh, bilateral chest, and back. Punch biopsies of lesions on his trunk and extremities were sent for histopathological examination with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) staining, immunohistochemical (IHC) studies, and molecular evaluation with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction.

A, The patient presented with 2 distinct, smooth-surfaced, 0.5- to 1.0-cm atrophic plaques with overlying hyperpigmentation on the left thigh. Both lesions exhibited the buttonhole sign on palpation. B and C, Histopathology shows poorly circumscribed hypercellular proliferation of spindle cells occupying the lower reticular dermis with lacelike infiltration of the subcutaneous fat (hematoxylin-eosin). The somewhat whorled, uniform appearing spindle cells with mildly hyperchromatic, elongated, wavy nuclei surrounded by pale cytoplasm. Mitotic figures and nuclear pleomorphism are uncommon.

The differential diagnosis for atrophic papules and plaques on the trunk and extremities includes a number of conditions, including neurofibroma, anetoderma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, atrophic variant, and medallionlike dermal dendrocyte hamartoma.

Neurofibromas are benign tumors of peripheral nerve sheath cells. They are typically solitary lesions, but can be multiple in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1. Neurofibromas are usually soft, skin-colored papules or nodules that can be located anywhere on the body. They are often associated with café au lait spots and axillary freckling.

Anetoderma is a rare, idiopathic skin disorder characterized by atrophic, smooth papules and plaques. The lesions are typically located on the trunk and extremities, and may be associated with telangiectasias and hypopigmentation. The etiology of anetoderma is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a defect in collagen synthesis.

Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans is a rare, locally aggressive, but rarely metastatic, mesenchymal neoplasm of the skin. It typically presents as a solitary, slowly growing, skin-colored or brown papule or nodule on the trunk or extremities. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans can be difficult to diagnose clinically, and often requires a biopsy for definitive diagnosis.

Medallionlike dermal dendrocyte hamartoma is a rare, benign cutaneous lesion that is characterized by a solitary, atrophic, coin-shaped plaque on the trunk or extremities. The lesion is typically present at birth or in early childhood, and is caused by a proliferation of dendritic cells in the dermis.

In the case presented, the patient presented with multiple atrophic papules and plaques on his trunk and extremities that developed gradually over several years. Although most were asymptomatic, the patient was concerned about the ongoing appearance of new lesions and the associated pain that some lesions were causing. His medical history was significant for adenosine deaminase–deficient severe combined immunodeficiency (ADA-SCID), which had been managed since childhood with twice weekly intramuscular injections of pegademase bovine enzyme replacement, thrice weekly trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for Pneumocystis prophylaxis, and monthly infusions of intravenous immunoglobulin.

 32%|███▏      | 488/1525 [1:52:40<3:53:38, 13.52s/it]Answer: A. Autoimmune Isaacs syndrome
Explanation:
The patient's presentation is most consistent with autoimmune Isaacs syndrome, a rare disorder characterized by generalized muscle stiffness, fasciculations, and cramps. The disorder is thought to be autoimmune in nature, and is associated with the presence of anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies. Treatment is typically with immunosuppressive therapy, such as corticosteroids or azathioprine.

Morvan syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by a combination of autonomic dysfunction, seizures, and psychosis. The disorder is thought to be caused by a defect in the hypothalamus, and is treated with a combination of medications, including anticonvulsants, antipsychotics, and medications to treat autonomic dysfunction.

Rippling muscle disease is a rare disorder characterized by involuntary, wave-like movements of the muscles. The disorder is caused by a defect in a protein called filamin C, and is treated with medications to relax the muscles.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the degeneration of motor neurons. The disorder is fatal, and there is no cure. Treatment is aimed at managing the symptoms, such as muscle weakness and spasticity.

In this case, the patient's presentation is most consistent with autoimmune Isaacs syndrome. The patient has a history of psoriasis, which is a known autoimmune disorder. The patient also has generalized muscle stiffness, fasciculations, and cramps, which are all common symptoms of autoimmune Isaacs syndrome. The patient's laboratory test results show the presence of anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies, which is a diagnostic finding for autoimmune Isaacs syndrome. The patient's chest computed tomography results are normal, which rules out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a tumor.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is autoimmune Isaacs syndrome.

Percutaneous revascularization is a minimally invasive procedure that is used to open up blocked arteries. It is a safe and effective treatment for vasospastic angina, and it has been shown to improve symptoms and reduce the risk of death.

In the case of this patient, she has already had two episodes of cardiac arrest, and her ejection fraction has declined to 30%. This indicates that she is at high risk of further cardiac events. Percutaneous revascularization is a safe and effective treatment for her condition, and it is likely to improve her symptoms and reduce her risk of death.

The other options are not as appropriate in this case. Corticosteroids are not a treatment for vasospastic angina. Reprogramming the ICD may be helpful in some cases, but it is not likely to be effective in this patient who has already had two episodes of cardiac arrest. Surgical revascularization is a more invasive procedure than percutaneous revascularization, and it is not as effective in treating vasospastic angina.

Therefore, the best option for this patient is percutaneous revascularization.

Explanation:

The patient is a 29-year-old woman with a 2-month history of left-sided epiphora, headache, and facial pressure. A polypoid lesion was identified at the left lateral nasal wall. Noncontrasted computed tomography showed a hyperdense mass involving the left medial canthus extending through the nasolacrimal duct into the left nasal cavity. The patient underwent endoscopic left maxillary antrostomy, ethmoidectomy, and biopsy of mass, with results of pathology analysis showing poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was positive for cytokeratin 5/6 and p63, and negative for Epstein-Barr virus, p16, CD45 (leukocyte common antigen), and synaptophysin. The patient was referred to a tertiary care facility for further treatment. On examination, there was a palpable subcutaneous nodule 1 cm inferior to the left medial canthus with normal overlying skin. On nasal endoscopy, residual tumor was visible at the anterior aspect of the lateral nasal wall. Computed tomography showed postoperative changes with enhancement of left medial canthus extending into nasolacrimal duct and along the lateral nasal sidewall.

The patient subsequently underwent left medial maxillectomy via lateral rhinotomy approach, with resection of residual tumor. The tumor appeared to originate from left lateral nasal wall, with involvement of nasal floor and extension into the orbit and periorbita. Histologically, the tumor extensively eroded maxillary bone, with abundant necrosis and widespread involvement of surgical margins. Microscopic examination showed sheets of monomorphic undifferentiated tumor cells with interspersed areas of abrupt squamous differentiation and keratinization.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is NUT carcinoma. NUT carcinoma is a rare, aggressive malignancy that typically arises in the sinonasal tract. It is characterized by the presence of a fusion gene between the NUT gene on chromosome 15 and another gene, such as NPM1 or BRD4. This fusion gene leads to the production of a chimeric protein that has oncogenic properties.

The clinical presentation of NUT carcinoma is variable, but it often includes nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and facial pain. The tumor may also spread to the orbit, lymph nodes, and other distant sites.

The diagnosis of NUT carcinoma is made on the basis of histopathologic examination. The tumor typically appears as sheets of monomorphic undifferentiated cells with scattered areas of squamous differentiation. Immunohistochemical staining is positive for NUT protein.

The treatment of NUT carcinoma is challenging. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment, but the tumor often recurs. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy may be used as adjuvant therapy. The prognosis for patients with NUT carcinoma is poor, with a median survival of only 18 months.

The other possible diagnoses in this case include olfactory neuroblastoma, sinonasal lymphoma, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Olfactory neuroblastoma is a rare, malignant tumor of the olfactory epithelium. It typically arises in the olfactory bulb and cribriform plate. Sinonasal lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that arises in the sinonasal tract. It is most common in the elderly and in patients with immunosuppression. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a type of carcinoma that arises in the nasopharynx. It is most common in Southeast Asia and China.

The clinical presentation, histopathologic features, and treatment of these tumors are different from those of NUT carcinoma. Therefore, the diagnosis of NUT carcinoma is the most likely in this case.

The patient has a history of Lyme disease, which can cause a variety of autoimmune conditions, including thyroiditis. Thyroiditis is an inflammation of the thyroid gland, which can cause a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, weight gain, hair loss, and dry skin. Thyroiditis can also cause enlargement of the thyroid gland, which can lead to proptosis.

In addition, the patient has bilateral T1 and T2 low-intensity intraconal soft tissue masses with avid enhancement on postcontrast images. These masses are consistent with orbital pseudotumor, which is a non-neoplastic inflammatory condition that can cause proptosis. Orbital pseudotumor is often associated with thyroiditis.

Therefore, the next step in the evaluation of this patient should be to obtain thyroid function test results or obtain endocrine evaluation results. This will help to determine if the patient has thyroiditis, which could be the cause of her orbital masses.

Chest computed tomography (CT) is not necessary in this case because the patient does not have any symptoms or signs that suggest a chest abnormality. Obtaining biopsy results is also not necessary at this time because the patient's symptoms are consistent with orbital pseudotumor, which is a non-neoplastic condition.

The patient in this case has a large, elevated, homogenous, gray mass in the macula of the right eye with temporal pallor of the optic disc. This is consistent with a diagnosis of Coats' disease, which is a rare, non-inflammatory, bilateral retinal vascular disorder that typically affects children. The disease is characterized by the development of abnormal blood vessels in the retina, which can lead to retinal detachment, blindness, and other complications.

There is no cure for Coats' disease, but there are treatments that can help to preserve vision. One treatment option is plaque brachytherapy, which involves placing a radioactive plaque on the surface of the eye to destroy the abnormal blood vessels. Another treatment option is enucleation, which is the removal of the affected eye.

The decision of whether to treat a patient with Coats' disease with plaque brachytherapy or enucleation is based on a number of factors, including the extent of the disease, the patient's age, and the patient's overall health. In general, plaque brachytherapy is preferred for patients who have less severe disease, while enucleation is preferred for patients who have more severe disease.

In this case, the patient is a 5-year-old boy with a history of an Escherichia coli infection complicated by hemolytic uremic syndrome. This suggests that the patient may have a more severe form of Coats' disease. Additionally, the patient has a visual acuity of 20/125 OD, which is significantly impaired. Based on these factors, it is my recommendation that the patient be referred for consideration of plaque brachytherapy or enucleation of the right eye.

The other options are not appropriate for this patient. Option B, ordering a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and a medical genetics evaluation, is not necessary in this case. The MRI would not be helpful in diagnosing or treating Coats' disease, and the medical genetics evaluation would only be necessary if there was a family history of the disease. Option C, starting oral corticosteroids, is not effective in treating Coats' disease. Option D, performing a vitreous tap and injecting with antivirals, is also not effective in treating Coats' disease.

Explanation:
The patient has a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, which is a separation of the retina from the underlying choroid. This can be caused by a retinal tear, which allows vitreous fluid to leak into the subretinal space. The patient's best-corrected visual acuity has worsened despite treatment with oral prednisone and a posterior sub-Tenon injection of triamcinolone acetonide. This suggests that the retinal detachment is not responding to medical therapy and that surgical intervention is necessary.

A scleral buckle is a surgical procedure that is used to reattach the retina to the choroid. A band of silicone or other material is placed around the sclera, which is the white of the eye. This band applies pressure to the retina, which helps to seal any retinal tears and allows the subretinal fluid to reabsorb.

A scleral buckle is a relatively safe and effective procedure for treating retinal detachment. In most cases, it can restore vision to the affected eye. However, there are some risks associated with the procedure, including infection, bleeding, and damage to the eye.

The other options are not appropriate for this patient. Diagnostic vitrectomy with cytologic testing is a procedure that is used to remove vitreous fluid from the eye for diagnostic purposes. This procedure would not be helpful in this case, as the diagnosis of retinal detachment is already known. Surgery to create scleral windows is a procedure that is used to treat retinal detachments that are caused by traction from scar tissue. This procedure would not be helpful in this case, as the patient's retinal detachment is caused by a retinal tear. Immunosuppressive therapy is a treatment that is used to suppress the immune system. This treatment would not be helpful in this case, as the patient's retinal detachment is not caused by an autoimmune condition.

Explanation:
The patient has type 1 diabetes and has developed diabetic retinopathy, which is a leading cause of blindness in people with diabetes. The patient has substantial loss of visual acuity in the left eye, which is due to retinal thickening, substantial capillary nonperfusion in the macular area, and a large area of disc neovascularization.

The treatment for diabetic retinopathy is to control blood sugar levels and to use laser photocoagulation to destroy the abnormal blood vessels in the retina. Intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections can also be used to treat diabetic retinopathy. VEGF is a protein that promotes the growth of new blood vessels. By blocking VEGF, intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor injections can help to reduce the growth of new blood vessels and to improve vision.

In this case, the patient has both retinal thickening and neovascularization. Laser photocoagulation is effective in treating retinal thickening, but it is not effective in treating neovascularization. Intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor injections are effective in treating neovascularization, but they are not effective in treating retinal thickening. Therefore, the best treatment for this patient is to use a combination of laser photocoagulation and intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor injections.

Pars plana vitrectomy with endolaser is a surgical procedure that is used to treat severe diabetic retinopathy. It is not indicated in this case, because the patient does not have severe diabetic retinopathy.

The patient in this case has bilateral loss of vision a few hours after a motor vehicle crash. The patient was wearing her seat belt, the airbag deployed, and an intense flexion-extension head movement occurred. Best-corrected visual acuity was 20/125 OD and 20/63 OS. Intraocular pressure was 19 mm Hg OD and 20 mm Hg OS. Slitlamp examination revealed no palpebral hematoma, and the anterior segment was found to be normal. On the fundus bilaterally, we only noted an alteration of the foveal reflection, with neither retinae commotio nor hemorrhages. Macular optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed bilateral macular edema with cystoid abnormalities. Central subfield thickness was 696 μm in the right eye and 392 μm in the left eye.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is traumatic macular edema. Traumatic macular edema is a common complication of blunt head trauma. It is caused by damage to the retinal capillaries, which leads to leakage of fluid into the macula. The macula is the part of the retina responsible for central vision. Traumatic macular edema can cause blurred vision, decreased visual acuity, and metamorphopsia (distortion of vision).

The treatment for traumatic macular edema is usually systemic or bilateral intraocular corticosteroid therapy. Systemic corticosteroids are given in high doses for a short period of time. Intraocular corticosteroids are injected into the vitreous cavity of the eye. Both systemic and intraocular corticosteroids can help to reduce inflammation and swelling in the macula.

In some cases, surgical removal of an epiretinal membrane may be necessary to treat traumatic macular edema. An epiretinal membrane is a thin sheet of tissue that forms on the surface of the retina. It can cause traction on the retina, which can lead to macular edema. Surgical removal of an epiretinal membrane can improve vision in patients with traumatic macular edema.

In the case of the patient in this question, the most appropriate treatment is systemic or bilateral intraocular corticosteroid therapy. The patient has bilateral macular edema, and there is no evidence of retinal detachment or other retinal abnormalities. Systemic or intraocular corticosteroids are the most effective treatments for traumatic macular edema. Surgical removal of an epiretinal membrane is not necessary in this case, as there is no evidence of an epiretinal membrane.

Explanation:

The patient is an 81-year-old woman with a 30 cm-wide, easily bleeding, violaceous, cutaneous lesion of the left scapular region with a superinfected necrotic central portion surrounded by satellite telangiectatic papules. The lesion was first noticed 5 months prior to presentation as a rapidly expanding, itchy, painful nodule. The patient has also experienced decreased appetite with weight loss of 7 kg over 5 months. On physical examination, there are no other cutaneous lesions, but multiple ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes, and enlarged supraclavicular and cervical lymph nodes are present. All other physical and laboratory findings are unremarkable. A skin punch biopsy of the lesion was obtained, which revealed a Merkel cell carcinoma.

Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare, aggressive neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin. It is most common in the elderly, with a median age at diagnosis of 70 years. The most common presenting symptom is a rapidly growing, painless nodule on the sun-exposed skin. Other symptoms may include itching, bleeding, and ulceration. Merkel cell carcinoma can spread to the lymph nodes and other organs, and is often fatal.

The diagnosis of Merkel cell carcinoma is made by biopsy. The treatment of Merkel cell carcinoma depends on the stage of the disease. Locally advanced disease is treated with surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. Metastatic disease is treated with chemotherapy.

The prognosis for Merkel cell carcinoma is poor, with a 5-year survival rate of 20-30%. However, with early diagnosis and treatment, the survival rate can be improved.

The other possible diagnoses are all less likely in this patient. Cutaneous metastasis from small cell lung cancer is a rare presentation, and would be more likely to occur in a younger patient with a history of lung cancer. Loxoscelism is a spider bite reaction that is more common in children and young adults. Primary cutaneous lymphoma (Sézary syndrome) is a type of lymphoma that affects the skin. It is more common in middle-aged and elderly people, but it would not typically present with a large, violaceous lesion with a necrotic central portion.

The ECG shows irregular, chaotic atrial activity with variable ventricular response. This is consistent with atrial fibrillation.

Atrial ectopic beats are premature beats that originate from the atria. They are usually not associated with significant symptoms or clinical significance.

Atrial flutter is a regular atrial tachycardia with a sawtooth appearance on the ECG. It is usually associated with a 2:1 AV block, but can also have a 1:1 AV block or variable AV block.

Multifocal atrial tachycardia is a chaotic atrial tachycardia with multiple P wave morphologies. It is usually associated with underlying lung disease or heart failure.

In this case, the patient has symptoms of fatigue, dizziness, and palpitations. The ECG shows irregular, chaotic atrial activity with variable ventricular response. This is consistent with atrial fibrillation. Therefore, the next step should be to review the ECG for features of atrial fibrillation.

A bronchoscopy is a procedure that allows a doctor to look inside the lungs. A bronchoscope is a thin tube with a camera on the end that is inserted through the nose or mouth. The doctor can use the bronchoscope to take pictures of the lungs, remove tissue samples, and give medications.

A bronchoalveolar lavage is a procedure that is done during a bronchoscopy. The doctor will inject a saline solution into the lungs through the bronchoscope. The solution will help to loosen mucus and cells from the lungs. The doctor will then suction the solution out of the lungs.

A transbronchial biopsy is a procedure that is also done during a bronchoscopy. The doctor will use a small needle to take tissue samples from the lungs. The tissue samples will be sent to a laboratory to be tested.

Bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsy is the best way to diagnose bronchiectasis. The procedure can help the doctor to determine the cause of the bronchiectasis and to rule out other conditions.

The other answers are incorrect because they are not the best way to diagnose bronchiectasis.

* Answer B: Assess serum α1-antitrypsin level and genotype is incorrect because serum α1-antitrypsin level and genotype are not the best way to diagnose bronchiectasis. Serum α1-antitrypsin level and genotype can be used to diagnose α1-antitrypsin deficiency, which is a genetic condition that can cause bronchiectasis. However, bronchiectasis can also be caused by other conditions, such as smoking and infection.
* Answer C: Order inhaled nasal nitric oxide and ciliary dyskinesia genetic testing is incorrect because inhaled nasal nitric oxide and ciliary dyskinesia genetic testing are not the best way to diagnose bronchiectasis. Inhaled nasal nitric oxide can be used to treat bronchiectasis, but it is not used to diagnose the condition. Ciliary dyskinesia genetic testing can be used to diagnose ciliary dyskinesia, which is a genetic condition that can cause bronchiectasis. However, bronchiectasis can also be caused by other conditions, such as smoking and infection.
* Answer D: Assess sweat chloride and cystic fibrosis genetic screening is incorrect because sweat chloride and cystic fibrosis genetic screening are not the best way to diagnose bronchiectasis. Sweat chloride and cystic fibrosis genetic screening can be used to diagnose cystic fibrosis, which is a genetic condition that can cause bronchiectasis. However, bronchiectasis can also be caused by other conditions, such as smoking and infection.

Explanation:

Dowling-Degos disease is a rare, chronic, progressive, and potentially fatal skin disorder characterized by poikilodermatous patches and thin plaques involving the axilla, groin, and flanks bilaterally. The lesions are often pruritic and may be associated with alopecia, nail dystrophy, and mucosal lesions. The histopathological features of Dowling-Degos disease include epidermal atrophy, acanthosis, hyperpigmentation, and hypopigmentation. Immunohistochemical analysis may show positivity for CD3, CD4, and CD8. The diagnosis of Dowling-Degos disease is based on the clinical presentation, histopathological findings, and immunohistochemical results. There is no cure for Dowling-Degos disease, but treatment may be aimed at relieving symptoms and preventing complications. Treatment options include topical corticosteroids, systemic corticosteroids, PUVA therapy, and photodynamic therapy.

The other options are incorrect because they do not fit the clinical presentation of the patient. Mycosis fungoides is a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that typically presents with a solitary patch or plaque. Large-plaque parapsoriasis is a chronic, relapsing, and remitting skin disorder characterized by scaly, hypopigmented patches. Cutaneous amyloidosis is a rare, non-inflammatory, and progressive disorder characterized by the deposition of amyloid protein in the skin.

Explanation:

The patient in the case report presents with an irregularly linear, rusty-brown, atrophic, streaklike plaque extending from the tip of his right shoulder to the right biceps, where it ended in arborizing purple plaque with scattered, slightly indurated, irregular papules within it. The patient also complains about a mild tingling sensation within the lesion.

The histopathology of the lesion shows a dermal infiltrate arranged in nodules with clefting between nodules; some inflammatory aggregates are also seen within dilated vessels. Immunohistochemical staining for CD68 antigen reveals that the infiltrate is composed mostly of histiocytes.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of intralymphatic histiocytosis, a rare disorder characterized by the accumulation of histiocytes within the lymphatic vessels. The clinical presentation of intralymphatic histiocytosis can vary depending on the site of involvement, but it often manifests as a single or multiple linear or nodular lesions on the skin. The lesions may be erythematous, violaceous, or brown in color, and they may be associated with pruritus, pain, or tenderness.

The diagnosis of intralymphatic histiocytosis is made on the basis of clinical presentation, histopathology, and immunohistochemical staining. There is no cure for intralymphatic histiocytosis, but treatment with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents can help to control the symptoms.

The other possible diagnoses are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Linear morphea is a chronic skin disease characterized by the formation of hard, white plaques on the skin. The lesions of linear morphea are typically linear in shape and they often follow the lines of Blaschko. Linear morphea is not associated with the clinical findings described in the case report.
* Serpentine supravenous hyperpigmentation is a benign condition characterized by the formation of linear streaks of hyperpigmentation on the skin. The streaks of hyperpigmentation are typically located on the upper extremities and they are associated with sun exposure. Serpentine supravenous hyperpigmentation is not associated with the clinical findings described in the case report.
* Intraoperative cutaneous electrical injury (Lichtenberg figure) is a transient skin lesion that can occur as a result of exposure to high-voltage electricity. The lesions of Lichtenberg figures are typically stellate or arborizing in shape and they are often associated with pain, burning, and paresthesias. Lichtenberg figures are not associated with the clinical findings described in the case report.

Diffuse melanosis cutis is a rare skin condition characterized by diffuse hyperpigmentation of the skin. It can be caused by a variety of factors, including sun exposure, medications, and certain medical conditions. In this case, the patient's diffuse hyperpigmentation is most likely due to his underlying malignancy.

Hemochromatosis is a genetic disorder characterized by the excessive accumulation of iron in the body. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, joint pain, and skin pigmentation. However, diffuse hyperpigmentation is not a typical symptom of hemochromatosis.

Addison disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes the adrenal glands to produce insufficient amounts of hormones. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, weakness, and weight loss. However, diffuse hyperpigmentation is not a typical symptom of Addison disease.

Hyperpigmentation due to sun exposure is a common condition that can cause the skin to darken in areas that are exposed to the sun. However, the patient's diffuse hyperpigmentation is not consistent with sun exposure.

In conclusion, the patient's diffuse hyperpigmentation is most likely due to his underlying malignancy.

Explanation:
The patient has a history of dilated cardiomyopathy and ventricular fibrillation arrest. She has an S-ICD in place for secondary prevention. She presents to the ED after receiving several shocks from the device. The surface electrogram shows ventricular tachycardia. The patient is hemodynamically stable.

The next step in management is to reprogram the S-ICD to a higher rate cut-off. This will prevent the device from delivering shocks for ventricular tachycardia that is not life-threatening. The patient should also be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure. If she develops signs or symptoms of heart failure, she should be treated with diuretics and inotropic agents.

Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic drug that can be used to treat ventricular tachycardia. However, it is not the first-line treatment for this patient. The patient already has an S-ICD in place, so amiodarone is not necessary to prevent ventricular fibrillation. Additionally, amiodarone can have serious side effects, including pulmonary fibrosis and liver toxicity.

Catheter ablation is a procedure that can be used to destroy the tissue that is causing the ventricular tachycardia. However, it is not the first-line treatment for this patient. The patient already has an S-ICD in place, so catheter ablation is not necessary to prevent ventricular fibrillation. Additionally, catheter ablation can have serious side effects, including bleeding and infection.

Therefore, the next step in management is to reprogram the S-ICD to a higher rate cut-off. The patient should also be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure.

Explanation:
The most likely diagnosis is schwannoma with a traumatic ulcerative granuloma with stromal eosinophilialike reaction. This is supported by the patient's history of a right tongue mass that developed after initial bite trauma, the clinical presentation of a 3 × 2-cm, exophytic and raised, plateaulike lesion on the right dorsolateral tongue with approximately 1 to 2 cm of surrounding induration, the biopsy findings of ulceration, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, and abundant acute and chronic inflammation replete with eosinophils, and the histopathologic findings of a spindled-cell proliferation with palisaded areas (Verocay bodies) and an associated inflammatory infiltrate with abundant eosinophils. The differential diagnosis includes traumatic ulcerative granuloma with stromal eosinophilia and ulceration due to drug- or infection-related sources. However, the patient's history and clinical presentation are more consistent with a schwannoma. Human papillomavirus–related squamous cell carcinoma is less likely given the patient's age and lack of risk factors. Ulcerated plexiform neurofibroma and ulcerated granular cell tumor are also less likely given the patient's history and clinical presentation.

Explanation:
The patient's history of HIV infection and hepatic tuberculosis, as well as his low CD4 count, make tuberculosis the most likely diagnosis. The perforation of the hard palate is a classic presentation of tuberculosis of the palate. The histopathologic findings of the biopsy specimen, which show caseating granulomas with acid-fast bacilli on Grocott methenamine silver stain, are also consistent with tuberculosis. Tertiary syphilis is a less likely diagnosis in this patient, as it is typically seen in patients with a history of untreated syphilis who have had the disease for many years. Histoplasmosis and sarcoidosis are also less likely diagnoses, as they are not typically associated with HIV infection.

 33%|███▎      | 507/1525 [1:57:12<4:04:39, 14.42s/it]The correct answer is: A. Perform posterior capsulotomy as part of pars plana vitrectomy.

The patient has a history of proliferative diabetic retinopathy, which is a condition that can lead to vitreous hemorrhage. A vitreous hemorrhage is a collection of blood in the vitreous humor, which is the clear gel that fills the inside of the eye. Vitreous hemorrhage can cause blurry vision, floaters, and a sudden decrease in vision.

In this case, the patient's vitreous hemorrhage has cleared, but he is now experiencing blurry vision. This is likely due to posterior capsule opacification (PCO), which is a clouding of the posterior capsule of the lens. The posterior capsule is the clear membrane that holds the lens in place. PCO is a common complication of cataract surgery.

The treatment for PCO is posterior capsulotomy, which is a procedure to remove the cloudy posterior capsule. Posterior capsulotomy can be performed with a YAG laser or with a surgical procedure called pars plana vitrectomy.

In this case, the patient should undergo posterior capsulotomy as part of pars plana vitrectomy. Pars plana vitrectomy is a surgical procedure to remove vitreous humor and other debris from the inside of the eye. It is a safe and effective procedure that can improve vision in patients with PCO.

The other options are not correct for the following reasons:

* Option B, Perform posterior capsulotomy with Nd:YAG laser, is not correct because the patient has a history of proliferative diabetic retinopathy. Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy is a safe and effective procedure for PCO, but it is not recommended for patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy. This is because the laser can damage the retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye.
* Option C, Exchange the IOL, is not correct because the patient's IOL is not the cause of his blurry vision. The patient's blurry vision is due to PCO, which can be treated with posterior capsulotomy.
* Option D, Observe the patient, is not correct because the patient's blurry vision is not likely to improve on its own. The patient should undergo posterior capsulotomy to improve his vision.

Explanation:
The patient has bilateral, gray-white, irregular, poorly circumscribed, linear and nummular central and peripheral corneal opacities, confined primarily to the subepithelium and focally to the underlying anterior stroma. This is consistent with the clinical presentation of superficial punctate keratitis (SPK), which is a common, bilateral, non-inflammatory corneal condition characterized by small, discrete, white opacities in the superficial epithelium. SPK is often associated with dry eye syndrome, and can be caused by a variety of factors, including contact lens wear, environmental irritants, and medications.

The initial treatment for SPK is typically supportive, with artificial tears to keep the eyes moist and lubricant ointment to help protect the cornea. Topical steroids may be used in some cases, but they can increase the risk of infection. In cases of severe SPK, a superficial corneal biopsy may be performed to remove the affected tissue and improve vision.

The other options are incorrect because they are not appropriate treatments for SPK. Oral acyclovir is used to treat viral infections, such as herpes simplex keratitis. Penetrating keratoplasty is a surgical procedure to replace a diseased cornea with a healthy cornea from a donor. Topical cyclosporine is an immunosuppressant medication that is used to treat a variety of eye conditions, including dry eye syndrome.

Explanation:

The patient has a cystic iris lesion that has grown in size and is now involving the visual axis. The lesion is causing photophobia and visual acuity has declined. Given these findings, surgical resection is the most appropriate management option.

Aspiration with absolute alcohol injection is not a recommended treatment for iris cysts. Alcohol injection can cause inflammation and scarring of the iris, which can lead to vision loss.

Laser cystotomy is a minimally invasive procedure that can be used to treat small, non-pigmented iris cysts. However, it is not effective for treating large, pigmented cysts or cysts that are involving the visual axis.

Continued monitoring is not an appropriate management option for a patient with a growing, symptomatic iris cyst. The cyst is likely to continue to grow and may eventually cause vision loss. Surgical resection is the only way to remove the cyst and prevent further vision loss.

The patient has a subluxed crystalline lens in the right eye. This means that the lens is no longer in its normal position in the eye, and it is floating in the vitreous humor. This can cause a number of problems, including blurred vision, double vision, and eye pain. The only way to treat a subluxed lens is to remove it. This can be done with a procedure called a pars plana lensectomy.

In a pars plana lensectomy, the surgeon makes a small incision in the sclera (the white of the eye) and then uses a small instrument to remove the lens. The lens is then replaced with an artificial lens.

Pars plana lensectomy is a safe and effective procedure. It is usually performed on an outpatient basis, and patients can usually go home the same day. There is a small risk of complications, such as infection, but these are rare.

In the case of the patient described in the question, the subluxed lens is causing her blurred vision and eye pain. The best way to treat her condition is to remove the lens with a pars plana lensectomy.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Plaque radiotherapy is a treatment for choroidal melanoma, which is a type of cancer. The patient in the question does not have cancer. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits is a diagnostic test that can be used to look for tumors or other abnormalities in the brain or orbits. It is not a treatment for a subluxed lens. Biopsy of the choroidal mass is a procedure in which a small piece of tissue is removed from the choroidal mass and examined under a microscope. This is not a necessary procedure in the case of the patient described in the question. The choroidal mass is not causing her any problems, and there is no evidence that it is cancerous.

Explanation:

The patient is an immunocompromised woman with a history of renal transplant. She presents with multiple ring-enhancing lesions on brain imaging, which are consistent with a diagnosis of primary central nervous system posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PCNSL). PCNSL is a rare, aggressive lymphoma that occurs in the brain of patients who are immunocompromised, such as those who have received a transplant. The most common symptoms of PCNSL are headache, seizures, and focal neurological deficits. The diagnosis of PCNSL is made by biopsy of the brain lesion. Treatment for PCNSL typically consists of combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The prognosis for PCNSL is poor, with a median survival of approximately 12 months.

The other possible diagnoses are not as likely in this patient. Toxoplasmosis is a parasitic infection that can cause brain lesions in immunocompromised patients. However, toxoplasmosis is more likely to cause single, non-enhancing lesions on brain imaging. Glioblastoma is a type of brain cancer that can occur in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients. However, glioblastoma is more likely to cause a single, large, enhancing lesion on brain imaging. Metastatic disease from an unknown primary neoplasm is a possibility in this patient, but it is less likely than PCNSL given the patient's history and presentation.

The patient's presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection. M. pneumoniae is a common cause of upper respiratory tract infections, including pneumonia. The typical presentation of M. pneumoniae infection is fever, cough, and malaise. In some cases, patients may also develop pharyngitis, rhinitis, and otitis media. M. pneumoniae can also cause skin lesions, including oral ulcers and genital ulcers.

The diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection is made based on the patient's history and physical examination, as well as laboratory testing. The most common laboratory test used to diagnose M. pneumoniae infection is a serologic test, which looks for antibodies to M. pneumoniae in the patient's blood. Other laboratory tests that may be used to diagnose M. pneumoniae infection include a chest X-ray and a throat culture.

There is no specific treatment for M. pneumoniae infection. However, antibiotics can be used to treat the symptoms of M. pneumoniae infection. The most commonly used antibiotic for M. pneumoniae infection is azithromycin. Azithromycin is an antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of bacteria, including M. pneumoniae. Azithromycin is usually given as a single dose.

The patient in this case has a history of widespread oral lesions that were self-resolving. The patient also has a positive serum enzyme immunoassay for Mycoplasma pneumoniae IgM. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection. The patient's symptoms are mild and he is hemodynamically stable. Therefore, the best course of treatment is to prescribe oral azithromycin.

A: Perform upper endoscopy and colonoscopy is incorrect because the patient does not have any symptoms that suggest a gastrointestinal tract infection.

B: Test for anti–double-stranded DNA antibodies is incorrect because the patient does not have any symptoms that suggest an autoimmune disease.

D: Prescribe oral suspension nystatin is incorrect because nystatin is an antifungal medication that is not effective against M. pneumoniae.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with Horner syndrome, which is a condition that results from damage to the sympathetic nervous system. Horner syndrome is characterized by ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis (loss of sweating) on the ipsilateral side of the face. The most common cause of Horner syndrome is a third cranial nerve palsy, which can be caused by a variety of conditions, including aneurysmal compression of the nerve, brainstem stroke, and trauma. However, Horner syndrome can also be caused by medications, such as topical beta-blockers and alpha-agonists.

In this case, the patient's history of hypertension and palmar and axillary hyperhidrosis suggests that she may be taking a medication that could be causing her Horner syndrome. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to perform a detailed review of the patient's medications to identify any potential causes of her condition. If no medication is found to be the cause, then further imaging studies, such as computed tomography angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head, may be necessary to rule out other causes of Horner syndrome.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Order computed tomography angiography of the head to rule out aneurysmal compression of the left third cranial nerve. This is not the most appropriate next step because the patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with an aneurysmal compression of the third cranial nerve.
* Option B: Order magnetic resonance imaging of the brain to rule out a brainstem stroke. This is not the most appropriate next step because the patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with a brainstem stroke.
* Option D: Perform pharmacologic testing with apraclonidine to confirm Horner syndrome. This is not the most appropriate next step because pharmacologic testing is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis of Horner syndrome in a patient with a typical history and physical examination.

The patient is a 65-year-old Vietnamese man with hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and chronic hepatitis B with cirrhosis. He presented with a 2-week history of shortness of breath at rest, orthopnea, and lower extremity edema. He reported a 4-month history of nonproductive cough, 5-kg weight loss, and fatigue. He immigrated to the United States as an adult more than 20 years before presentation. His temperature was 37°C, heart rate was 78/min, respiratory rate was 17/min, and blood pressure was 158/95 mm Hg. A chest radiographic image suggested cardiomegaly and a computed tomographic scan demonstrated a moderate to large pericardial effusion. A pericardial drain was placed and pericardial fluid was sent to the laboratory for evaluation. Initial pericardial fluid study results are presented in the Table. Empirical treatment for tuberculosis was initiated. Three days later, an adenosine deaminase (ADA) level of 118.1 U/L (normal range, 0.0-11.3 U/L) from pericardial fluid was reported from the laboratory.

The elevated ADA level is highly suggestive of tuberculosis. Therefore, further nontubercular diagnostic testing is not necessary. The patient should continue antitubercular therapy for a total of 6 months.

A. Perform additional pericardial effusion cytology and culture testing is incorrect because the patient has already been started on empirical treatment for tuberculosis. Further diagnostic testing is not necessary.

C. Initiate oral colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and steroids for systemic inflammation is incorrect because the patient has a pericardial effusion secondary to tuberculosis. Colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and steroids are not indicated for the treatment of tuberculosis.

D. Perform an interferon-γ release assay (IGRA) is incorrect because the patient has already been started on empirical treatment for tuberculosis. An IGRA is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis of tuberculosis.

The patient in the case has a well-circumscribed mass on CT scan. This could be a number of things, including a benign cyst, a malignant tumor, or an abscess. The next step in the evaluation is to obtain a tissue diagnosis. This can be done with an interventional radiology–guided biopsy, which is a minimally invasive procedure that can be done under local anesthesia. This is the best option because it is safe, accurate, and does not require surgery.

Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is a procedure that involves inserting a scope into the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. This procedure is used to diagnose and treat a variety of conditions, including ulcers, tumors, and bleeding. However, it is not the best option for the patient in this case because it would not provide a tissue diagnosis.

Diagnostic laparoscopy with peritoneal washings is a procedure that involves making a small incision in the abdomen and inserting a scope to view the organs inside. This procedure is used to diagnose and treat a variety of conditions, including appendicitis, ovarian cysts, and cancer. However, it is not the best option for the patient in this case because it would not provide a tissue diagnosis.

Exploratory laparotomy and excision of the mass is a major surgery that involves making a large incision in the abdomen to remove the mass. This procedure is only necessary if the mass is malignant or if it is causing significant symptoms. However, it is not the best option for the patient in this case because it is a major surgery and it is not necessary to remove the mass at this time.

Explanation:

Disseminated candidiasis is a fungal infection that can occur in people with weakened immune systems, such as those with leukemia. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including fever, chills, and skin lesions. The skin lesions can be papules, pustules, or nodules. In some cases, the lesions may have a white center and a dark brown core. This is known as transepidermal elimination, and it occurs when the fungus grows through the layers of the skin and exits through the pores.

Reactive perforating collagenosis is a rare skin condition that is characterized by the formation of papules and pustules. The papules and pustules often have a central core that is composed of necrotic tissue. The condition is thought to be caused by an abnormal immune response to an infection or other trigger.

Disseminated cryptococcosis is a fungal infection that can occur in people with weakened immune systems, such as those with leukemia. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including fever, chills, and headache. The infection can also spread to the lungs, brain, and other organs.

Malassezia (formerly Pityrosporum) folliculitis is a common skin condition that is caused by a yeast called Malassezia. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including itching, redness, and flaking of the skin. The condition is most common in people with oily skin.

The patient in the case has a history of leukemia and is currently receiving treatment for a fungal pneumonia. She has developed multiple asymptomatic pink papules on the trunk and extremities. The papules have a white firm center and a dark brown core. These findings are most consistent with disseminated candidiasis with transepidermal elimination. The other options are less likely because they do not typically cause the formation of papules with a central core.

The patient is a 30-year-old woman with a 4-month history of widespread thickened, verrucous, hyperpigmented plaques distributed symmetrically on her body, especially on the axillae, anogenital region, inguinal skin, and both palms, with slight itching. The verrucous plaques also involved the conjunctiva, lips, and gingiva. The patient had experienced a weight loss of 6 kg during the last 3 months. Within the last month, the patient’s thyroid became enlarged, and she developed anorexia and abdominal discomfort. Laboratory test results revealed remarkably elevated levels of carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 19-9, carbohydrate antigen 125, tissue polypeptide antigen and carbohydrate antigen 242. Biopsy specimens of lesions on the axillae and lips both revealed a papillary structure with hyperkeratosis. An endoscopic examination and computed tomographic scan of the abdomen were performed.

The most likely diagnosis is malignant acanthosis nigricans. Malignant acanthosis nigricans is a skin condition characterized by velvety, hyperpigmented plaques that develop in areas of skin that rub together, such as the armpits, groin, and neck. The lesions are often associated with underlying malignancy, most commonly in the gastrointestinal tract. Other associated conditions include obesity, diabetes, and endocrine disorders.

The diagnosis of malignant acanthosis nigricans is made based on the clinical presentation and the results of a biopsy. The biopsy shows a characteristic papillary architecture with hyperkeratosis. The treatment of malignant acanthosis nigricans is aimed at the underlying malignancy. In some cases, the lesions may be treated with topical or systemic medications.

The other possible diagnoses are not as likely in this case. Benign acanthosis nigricans is a common skin condition that is not associated with malignancy. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is a type of skin cancer that can cause skin lesions that resemble malignant acanthosis nigricans. However, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is not associated with the other symptoms that this patient is experiencing, such as weight loss, thyroid enlargement, and abdominal discomfort. Malignant Addison disease is a rare condition that is characterized by adrenal insufficiency. Adrenal insufficiency can cause skin changes, but these changes are not typically as severe as the lesions that this patient is experiencing.

Acrokeratosis paraneoplastica is a rare skin condition that is associated with underlying malignancy. It is characterized by the development of erythematous, scaly plaques on the acral skin (hands and feet). There is no evidence of vasculitis in this condition.

Cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis is a small vessel vasculitis that can affect the skin, kidneys, and other organs. It is characterized by the presence of leukocytoclastic vasculitis (inflammation of small blood vessels with infiltration of neutrophils) in the skin biopsy. The patient in this case has a generalized rash with purpuralike lesions that are predominantly present over the trunk and lower extremities. The biopsy specimen shows leukocytoclastic vasculitis. This is consistent with a diagnosis of cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis.

Purpura fulminans is a life-threatening condition that is characterized by widespread purpura, hypotension, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. It is usually caused by infection with Neisseria meningitidis, but it can also be caused by other infections, drugs, or autoimmune diseases. The patient in this case does not have any of the clinical features of purpura fulminans.

Henoch-Schönlein purpura is a vasculitis that typically affects children. It is characterized by the triad of purpura, abdominal pain, and arthritis. The patient in this case does not have any of the clinical features of Henoch-Schönlein purpura.

In conclusion, the correct diagnosis is **B: Cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis**.

The patient presented with a sudden onset of chest pain radiating to the left arm, which is a classic presentation of myocardial infarction (MI). The patient also had an elevated troponin level, which is a marker of myocardial necrosis. The 12-lead electrocardiogram showed marked ST-segment elevations in leads V2 to V5, which is consistent with an acute MI.

The patient's history of chest pain requiring a coronary angiogram approximately 1 year prior to presentation suggests that she may have coronary artery disease. The angiographic findings of a 99% stenosis of the left anterior descending coronary artery confirm this diagnosis.

The standard of care for patients with ST-segment elevation MI is to undergo percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) as soon as possible. PCI involves the insertion of a balloon catheter into the narrowed coronary artery and inflating the balloon to widen the artery. This procedure can restore blood flow to the heart muscle and reduce the risk of death and other complications.

In addition to PCI, the patient should also be started on medical therapy. This includes aspirin, a β-blocker, clopidogrel, and a statin. Aspirin is an antiplatelet drug that helps to prevent blood clots. A β-blocker is a medication that helps to slow the heart rate and lower blood pressure. Clopidogrel is an antiplatelet drug that works in a similar way to aspirin. A statin is a medication that lowers cholesterol levels.

The patient should also be admitted to the hospital for close monitoring. She should be given oxygen therapy and her heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen saturation should be closely monitored. She should also be started on intravenous fluids and pain medication.

The patient's prognosis is good if she is treated promptly and aggressively. With appropriate treatment, the majority of patients with ST-segment elevation MI make a full recovery.

Explanation:
The patient is a 59-year-old Hispanic woman with a history of stage IV endometrial serous adenocarcinoma (ESA) 4 years prior that was treated with total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, omentectomy, and peritoneal lavage. She had developed a recurrence for which she had just completed 3 cycles of treatment with carboplatin. She also had a history of anxiety, hypertension, and pterygium, and she was taking gabapentin, lorazepam, prochlorperazine, metoprolol succinate, bromfenac and ketorolac ophthalmic solution, and aprepitant.

The patient presented with a 6-month history of intermittent pain in the right posterior mandibular gingiva. Her local dentist had prescribed an antibiotic and performed a tooth extraction in the area 6 months prior with no improvement in symptoms. Ultimately, her pain became persistent and radiated to the right lower lip.

Intraoral examination revealed a 1.5 × 1.0-cm firm, erythematous gingival mass in the area of missing right mandibular second bicuspid and first molar with buccal and lingual expansion. The right mandibular first bicuspid was grade 3 mobile. A periapical radiograph was obtained, and results showed a diffuse, poorly demarcated radiolucency measuring approximately 1.2 × 0.8 cm.

Findings from an incisional biopsy of the mass showed an infiltrative tumor. Tumor cells were positive for CK7, PAX8, and WT-1, and negative for CK20 and TTF-1.

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is oral metastasis of her endometrial serous adenocarcinoma. The patient's history of endometrial serous adenocarcinoma, the presence of a gingival mass in the area of previous tooth extraction, and the infiltrative nature of the tumor on biopsy all support this diagnosis.

Pyogenic granuloma is a benign vascular lesion that is typically seen in children and young adults. It is usually caused by trauma or inflammation, and it can occur anywhere in the oral cavity. Gingival/periodontal abscesses are also caused by infection, and they are typically associated with poor oral hygiene. Both pyogenic granulomas and gingival/periodontal abscesses are typically self-limiting, and they can be treated with antibiotics or surgical excision.

Squamous cell carcinoma is a malignant epithelial tumor that can occur in any part of the body, including the oral cavity. It is the most common type of oral cancer, and it is typically associated with tobacco use, alcohol use, and poor oral hygiene. Squamous cell carcinoma can be treated with surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.

In the patient's case, the history of endometrial serous adenocarcinoma, the presence of a gingival mass in the area of previous tooth extraction, and the infiltrative nature of the tumor on biopsy all support the diagnosis of oral metastasis.

 34%|███▍      | 522/1525 [2:00:36<3:33:08, 12.75s/it]Answer: C. Nocardiosis

Explanation:

The patient is a woman in her 60s with a history of end-stage renal disease who had a kidney transplant 9 months previously. She presented with progressive cough, dyspnea, and hoarseness. Her history also included chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and a 14-pack-year smoking history. She initially presented 3 months prior with upper respiratory symptoms, which continued to worsen despite oral antibiotic therapy. Her cough became productive with white, frothy phlegm that was accompanied by fever, wheezing, hoarseness, and fatigue. Her dyspnea worsened in the supine position.

Flexible laryngotracheoscopy results revealed diffuse, white-to-yellow pseudomembranous changes involving the glottis and supraglottis, posterior tracheal wall, and left mainstem bronchus with skip lesions in the subglottis and distal 1 cm of the trachea. Glottic mobility was limited in both abduction and adduction with substantial airway obstruction. Computed tomographic findings revealed posterior tracheal wall thickening with the loss of the fat plane between the trachea and esophagus, and a moderate to severe obstruction within the distal left mainstem bronchus. Biopsy results showed branching organisms superficial to squamous epithelium.

The most likely diagnosis is nocardiosis. Nocardiosis is an opportunistic infection caused by Nocardia species, which are Gram-positive, aerobic, branching bacteria. Nocardiosis is most commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, such as those with solid organ transplants. The most common presentation of nocardiosis is pneumonia, but it can also involve the skin, central nervous system, and other organs. The diagnosis of nocardiosis is made by culture of the organism from clinical specimens. Treatment of nocardiosis is with antibiotics, such as imipenem or meropenem.

The other possible diagnoses are posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder, squamous cell carcinoma, and aspergillosis. Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder is a type of cancer that can occur after an organ transplant. Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that can occur in the skin, lungs, or other organs. Aspergillosis is a fungal infection that can occur in the lungs, sinuses, or other organs.

The patient in this case is most likely to have nocardiosis because she has a history of end-stage renal disease and a kidney transplant, she is immunocompromised, and she has clinical and radiological findings consistent with nocardiosis. The other possible diagnoses are less likely because they do not explain all of the patient's clinical findings.

Explanation:

* A low-grade sinonasal adenocarcinoma is a malignant neoplasm that arises from the sinonasal epithelium. It is characterized by a polypoid mass with avid post–contrast enhancement on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The patient in this case did not have any noteworthy rhinological symptoms, and the biopsy findings revealed submucosal proliferation of seromucinous and respiratory epithelial glands, which are not typical of a low-grade sinonasal adenocarcinoma.
* Inflammatory nasal polyps are benign lesions that arise from the nasal mucosa. They are typically multiple and bilateral, and they can cause nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, and facial pain. The patient in this case had a single, unilateral mass, which is not typical of inflammatory nasal polyps.
* An inverted papilloma is a benign neoplasm that arises from the sinonasal epithelium. It is characterized by a polypoid mass with a central depression on MRI. The patient in this case did not have any noteworthy rhinological symptoms, and the biopsy findings revealed submucosal proliferation of seromucinous and respiratory epithelial glands, which are not typical of an inverted papilloma.
* A nasal cavity hamartoma is a benign neoplasm that arises from the nasal mucosa. It is composed of a mixture of tissues that are normally found in the nose, such as cartilage, bone, and glands. It is typically a single, unilateral mass, and it can cause nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, and facial pain. The patient in this case had a single, unilateral mass, and the biopsy findings revealed submucosal proliferation of seromucinous and respiratory epithelial glands, which are consistent with a nasal cavity hamartoma.

Explanation: The patient has a history of a growth hormone–producing pituitary macroadenoma for which she underwent surgical resection 2.5 years prior to presentation, followed by γ-knife radiosurgery (50 Gy) 6 months after the initial surgical procedure. The patient's symptoms of intermittent diplopia that is provoked after looking to the right are consistent with a third nerve palsy. A third nerve palsy can be caused by a variety of conditions, including tumors, inflammation, and trauma. In this case, the patient's history of a pituitary macroadenoma makes it likely that her third nerve palsy is due to a tumor. A cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is the most sensitive test for detecting tumors in the brain. Therefore, the next step in the management of this patient is to order a cranial MRI scan.

A trial of carbamazepine (A) is not indicated in this patient because she does not have any symptoms of seizures. Bilateral lateral rectus recessions (B) are a surgical treatment for strabismus, which is a misalignment of the eyes. In this case, the patient's eyes are only misaligned when she looks to the right, so bilateral lateral rectus recessions would not be an appropriate treatment. Obtaining anti-acetylcholine receptor binding antibodies (D) is not indicated in this patient because she does not have any symptoms of myasthenia gravis, which is an autoimmune disorder that can cause muscle weakness.

Explanation:

The most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is to obtain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits. This is because the patient has a large, vascular, multifocal mass involving the bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva near the lateral canthus. This type of lesion is most commonly a cavernous hemangioma, which is a benign tumor of blood vessels. However, it is important to rule out other possible causes of the lesion, such as a metastasis from a systemic cancer. MRI is the best imaging modality for evaluating the brain and orbits, and it can help to identify any evidence of metastasis.

Excisional biopsy of the lesion is not necessary at this time, as the lesion is benign and is not causing any symptoms. Needle drainage of the lesion is also not necessary, as this would not provide any benefit and could potentially increase the risk of complications. Systemic propranolol is a medication that is used to treat hemangiomas, but it is not typically used in patients with cavernous hemangiomas. In addition, systemic propranolol can have significant side effects, such as hypotension and bradycardia. Therefore, it is not the best option for this patient.

Explanation:

The patient is a 13-year-old boy with a choroidal mass in the right eye. The mass has been followed closely and has continued to progress. The visual acuity has worsened to 20/200, and the tumor mass has extended closer to the fovea. The mass measures 15 mm in basal diameter with a thickness of 6.4 mm on B-scan ultrasonography.

The most appropriate treatment for this patient is iodine 125 plaque brachytherapy. Iodine 125 plaque brachytherapy is a type of radiation therapy that uses a radioactive isotope to deliver a high dose of radiation to a small area. This type of therapy is very effective in treating choroidal tumors.

The other options are not as appropriate for this patient. Photodynamic therapy is a type of laser therapy that is used to treat certain types of eye tumors. However, it is not as effective as iodine 125 plaque brachytherapy in treating choroidal tumors. Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy injections are a type of treatment that is used to slow the growth of new blood vessels in tumors. However, they are not as effective as iodine 125 plaque brachytherapy in treating choroidal tumors. External beam radiotherapy is a type of radiation therapy that uses a machine to deliver a beam of radiation to the tumor. However, it is not as effective as iodine 125 plaque brachytherapy in treating choroidal tumors.

In conclusion, the most appropriate treatment for this patient is iodine 125 plaque brachytherapy. This type of therapy is very effective in treating choroidal tumors.

The patient has a history of pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency, which is a genetic disorder that affects the body's ability to produce energy. This can lead to a variety of symptoms, including visual field loss. In this case, the patient also has optic nerve cupping and pallor, which are signs of glaucoma. Glaucoma is a disease that damages the optic nerve, which can lead to vision loss.

The patient's visual field loss is consistent with glaucoma, but it is also possible that it is caused by another condition, such as a tumor or a stroke. In order to rule out other possible causes, it is important to order a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain and orbits. An MRI scan is a type of imaging test that uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of the inside of the body. It can be used to detect tumors, strokes, and other conditions that can affect the optic nerve.

Observation, referral to endocrinology, and repeated visual fields with IOP check in 1 month are not appropriate next steps in this case. Observation is not appropriate because the patient's visual field loss is progressive and could lead to further vision loss. Referral to endocrinology is not appropriate because the patient's visual field loss is not likely to be caused by a thyroid disorder. Repeated visual fields with IOP check in 1 month is not appropriate because the patient's visual field loss is already significant and is likely to progress further.

In conclusion, the correct next step in the management of this patient is to order a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain and orbits.

Explanation:

The patient is presenting with a febrile, hypotensive patient with bilateral lung crackles. The most likely diagnosis is infective endocarditis, which is a bacterial infection of the heart valves. The patient's history of hypertension and poor dentition are risk factors for infective endocarditis. The transesophageal echocardiogram shows a vegetation on the aortic valve, which is a characteristic finding of infective endocarditis.

The treatment for infective endocarditis is with broad-spectrum antibiotics. The antibiotics should be chosen based on the results of blood cultures. The patient should also be monitored closely for signs of heart failure or other complications of infective endocarditis.

The other options are not appropriate for this patient. Diuresis with furosemide is not indicated in the treatment of infective endocarditis. Emergency surgery for aortic valve repair is not indicated in the absence of evidence of hemodynamic instability. An intra-aortic balloon pump is not indicated in the treatment of infective endocarditis.

Explanation: Scleromyxedema is a rare, chronic, multisystem disorder characterized by diffuse cutaneous infiltration with mucin deposition, fibrosis, and sclerosis. It is a form of mucinosis, a group of disorders characterized by the deposition of mucin in the skin and other tissues.

The most common presenting features of scleromyxedema are thickened, waxy skin, joint pain, and fatigue. Other features may include Raynaud phenomenon, carpal tunnel syndrome, and dysphagia.

The diagnosis of scleromyxedema is made based on the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and skin biopsy. Laboratory findings may include an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), an elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), and a monoclonal gammopathy. Skin biopsy shows diffuse mucin deposition in the dermis.

There is no cure for scleromyxedema, but treatment can help to improve symptoms. Treatment options include corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs, and phototherapy.

The other options are incorrect because they do not fit the clinical presentation of the patient. Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides) is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that affects the skin. Lepromatous leprosy is a chronic, progressive, and disabling disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. Scleroderma is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes thickening and tightening of the skin and connective tissues.

Explanation:

Hyperkeratosis lenticularis perstans (HLP) is a rare, chronic, asymptomatic skin condition characterized by the appearance of small, discrete, hyperkeratotic papules on the extremities. The papules are typically 1 to 2 mm in diameter and are often arranged in a linear or annular pattern. The condition is most commonly seen in adults, and there is no gender predilection. The etiology of HLP is unknown, but it is thought to be a post-inflammatory condition. There is no specific treatment for HLP, and the condition is usually self-limited. However, treatment may be necessary to relieve symptoms such as pruritus or pain.

In the case presented, the patient is a man in his 60s who presents with a 10-year history of a slowly progressive, asymptomatic cutaneous eruption on his left leg. The eruption is characterized by reddish brown hyperkeratotic papules 1 to 10 mm wide on the front and back of the left leg from knee to ankle. The rest of the physical examination findings are unremarkable. Removal of the scales caused slight bleeding. A lesional skin biopsy was performed, which revealed compact hyperkeratosis, epidermal atrophy, and bandlike lymphocyte infiltrate in the superficial dermis. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of HLP.

The other possible diagnoses are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Stucco keratoses are a type of seborrheic keratosis that typically present as small, brown, dome-shaped papules on the face, neck, and trunk. They are not associated with hyperkeratosis or epidermal atrophy.
* Disseminated superficial actinic porokeratosis (DSAP) is a chronic, progressive, actinic skin disorder characterized by the appearance of multiple, small, sharply demarcated, hyperkeratotic papules on sun-exposed skin. The papules are typically 1 to 5 mm in diameter and are often arranged in a linear or annular pattern. DSAP is most commonly seen in older adults, and there is a female predominance. The etiology of DSAP is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. There is no specific treatment for DSAP, and the condition is usually self-limited. However, treatment may be necessary to relieve symptoms such as pruritus or pain.
* Kyrle disease is a rare, chronic, progressive, autosomal recessive disorder characterized by the appearance of multiple, warty, hyperkeratotic papules on the extremities. The papules are typically 1 to 10 cm in diameter and are often arranged in a linear or annular pattern. Kyrle disease is most commonly seen in children and young adults, and there is a male predominance. The etiology of Kyrle disease is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a defect in the protein LEKT1. There is no specific treatment for Kyrle disease, and the condition is usually fatal. However, treatment may be necessary to relieve symptoms such as pruritus or pain.

Myoclonus is a brief, involuntary contraction of a muscle or group of muscles. It can be caused by a variety of conditions, including epilepsy, stroke, and brain tumors.

Paroxysmal dyskinesia is a sudden, involuntary movement of one or more body parts. It can be caused by a variety of conditions, including medications, toxins, and neurological disorders.

Tic disorders are characterized by repetitive, involuntary movements or vocalizations. They are often associated with Tourette syndrome.

Faciobrachial dystonic seizures are a type of focal seizure that affects the face, arm, and leg on one side of the body. They are characterized by involuntary, sustained contractions of the muscles in the affected area.

The patient in the case presented with recurrent involuntary contractions of the face, arm, and leg that were sustained for a few seconds before muscle relaxation occurred. The movements were not elicited by action or exertion. There was no epileptic abnormality that correlated with the movements on EEG, and head magnetic resonance imaging was unremarkable. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of faciobrachial dystonic seizures.

A: Myoclonus is not a likely diagnosis in this case because the movements were sustained for a few seconds, rather than being brief.

B: Paroxysmal dyskinesia is not a likely diagnosis in this case because the movements were not associated with medications, toxins, or neurological disorders.

D: Tic disorders are not a likely diagnosis in this case because the movements were not repetitive or associated with Tourette syndrome.

The patient has cystoid macular edema (CME) with scattered intraretinal hemorrhages (IRHs). CME is a common condition that can occur due to a variety of causes, including inflammation, diabetic retinopathy, and retinal vein occlusion. IRHs are also a common finding in CME, and can be caused by a number of factors, including inflammation, hypertension, and trauma.

The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with CME secondary to her meningioma. The meningioma is likely causing inflammation and increased vascular permeability in the retina, leading to CME. The IRHs are also likely secondary to the inflammation.

The treatment of CME is aimed at reducing the inflammation and improving the retinal edema. Intravitreal injections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents are a common and effective treatment for CME. VEGF is a protein that promotes the growth of new blood vessels. In the eye, VEGF can lead to the formation of abnormal new blood vessels, which can leak fluid into the retina. Anti-VEGF agents block the action of VEGF, which can help to reduce inflammation and improve the retinal edema.

In this case, the patient is a good candidate for intravitreal injection of an anti-VEGF agent. She has a history of meningioma, which is a known cause of CME. She also has CME with IRHs, which are consistent with inflammation. Intravitreal injection of an anti-VEGF agent is the most likely to be effective in treating her CME.

The other options are not as likely to be effective in treating the patient's CME. Systemic corticosteroids can be used to treat inflammation, but they are not as effective as intravitreal injection of an anti-VEGF agent. Laboratory workup for uveitis is not necessary, as the patient's history and examination findings are not consistent with uveitis. Cerebral angiography is not necessary, as the patient's magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography of the brain and orbits are normal.

Explanation:
The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of Graves' orbitopathy, a thyroid-related autoimmune disorder that causes inflammation of the muscles and tissues around the eyes. The most common symptoms of Graves' orbitopathy are double vision, eyelid drooping, and proptosis (bulging of the eyes).

A CT scan of the orbits with contrast can help to confirm the diagnosis of Graves' orbitopathy and assess the severity of the disease. The scan can show inflammation of the muscles and tissues around the eyes, as well as any associated bone changes.

Myasthenia gravis testing is not necessary in this case because the patient's history and examination findings are not consistent with a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder that causes weakness of the skeletal muscles, including the muscles that control eye movement. Symptoms of myasthenia gravis typically come and go, and they may be worse after exercise or at the end of the day.

Referral for strabismus surgery is not necessary at this time because the patient's double vision is likely due to the inflammation of the muscles around her eyes. Strabismus surgery is only necessary if the double vision is not resolved with treatment of the underlying cause.

Thyroid function testing is not necessary in this case because the patient's history and examination findings are not consistent with a thyroid disorder. Thyroid disorders can cause a variety of symptoms, including double vision, but they do not typically cause eyelid drooping or proptosis.

In conclusion, the patient's history and examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of Graves' orbitopathy. A CT scan of the orbits with contrast is the best next step to confirm the diagnosis and assess the severity of the disease.

The patient in the case presented with a pruritic rash that developed within 24 hours of her first day of chemotherapy with ABVD. ABVD is a combination chemotherapy regimen that is commonly used to treat Hodgkin lymphoma. Bleomycin is one of the four drugs in ABVD, and it is known to cause a number of side effects, including skin rash. The patient's rash was consistent with bleomycin toxic effects in that it was linear, hyperpigmented, and appeared on the arms, back, and legs. In addition, the patient's rash was poorly responsive to antihistamines and topical steroids, which is also consistent with bleomycin toxicity.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Paraneoplastic skin disease is a rare condition that can occur in patients with cancer. It is characterized by the development of skin lesions that are not caused by the cancer itself, but by the cancer's effects on the body's immune system. The patient in the case did not have any evidence of paraneoplastic skin disease.
* Polymorphic eruption of pregnancy is a rash that can occur in pregnant women. It is characterized by the development of red, itchy bumps on the skin. The patient in the case did not have any evidence of polymorphic eruption of pregnancy.
* Vinblastine toxic effects can cause a number of side effects, including hair loss, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. However, vinblastine toxicity does not typically cause a skin rash.

 35%|███▌      | 536/1525 [2:03:41<2:58:15, 10.81s/it]The correct answer is: **C. Burkitt lymphoma**

Burkitt lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal B cells. It is most common in children and young adults, and it is often associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection. Burkitt lymphoma can occur anywhere in the body, but it is most common in the abdomen, head and neck, and bone marrow.

The patient in this case presents with multiple erythematous, firm, subcutaneous nodules on the left side of the chest, abdomen, and left upper limb. These nodules are consistent with the clinical presentation of Burkitt lymphoma. Additionally, the patient has a history of HIV infection, which is a known risk factor for Burkitt lymphoma.

The histopathologic examination of the skin biopsy specimen shows infiltration with lymphoid cells and few histiocytes in the subcutaneous tissue. This finding is also consistent with Burkitt lymphoma. Finally, the immunohistochemical analysis of the biopsy specimen shows nuclear positivity for c-Myc, which is a protein that is often overexpressed in Burkitt lymphoma cells.

In conclusion, the patient in this case has a clinical presentation, histopathologic findings, and immunohistochemical results that are all consistent with a diagnosis of Burkitt lymphoma.

The other possible diagnoses are not as likely in this case. Kaposi sarcoma is a type of cancer that is caused by the human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8). It is most common in people with HIV infection, but it can also occur in people who are not infected with HIV. Kaposi sarcoma typically presents as skin lesions, but it can also spread to other organs. The patient in this case does not have any skin lesions that are consistent with Kaposi sarcoma.

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal B cells. It is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in adults. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma can occur anywhere in the body, but it is most common in the lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow. The patient in this case does not have any lymphadenopathy or bone marrow involvement, which makes diffuse large B-cell lymphoma less likely.

Leukemia cutis is a type of leukemia that involves the skin. It is characterized by the presence of leukemic cells in the skin. Leukemia cutis can occur in people with acute myeloid leukemia or acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The patient in this case does not have any evidence of leukemia in the blood, which makes leukemia cutis less likely.

Explanation:

The patient in this case has a history of alcohol abuse and presents with new-onset heart failure. Alcohol abuse can cause thiamine deficiency, which can lead to Wernicke's encephalopathy and Korsakoff's syndrome. These conditions are characterized by confusion, ataxia, and memory impairment. Thiamine therapy is the first-line treatment for Wernicke's encephalopathy and Korsakoff's syndrome. It is important to start thiamine therapy as soon as possible, as the symptoms of these conditions can worsen rapidly.

Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy is a life-support treatment that is used to provide oxygen and remove carbon dioxide from the blood when the heart and lungs are unable to do so. ECMO is a complex procedure that is not without risks. It is typically used as a bridge to transplant or recovery in patients with severe heart or lung failure.

Intravenous β-blocker therapy is a common treatment for heart failure. β-blockers help to slow the heart rate and reduce blood pressure. They can also improve symptoms of heart failure, such as shortness of breath and fatigue. However, β-blockers are not appropriate for all patients with heart failure. They can worsen symptoms in patients with low blood pressure or heart block.

Intravenous bicarbonate therapy is used to treat metabolic acidosis. Metabolic acidosis is a condition in which the blood has too much acid. It can be caused by a number of conditions, including kidney failure, diarrhea, and diabetic ketoacidosis. Intravenous bicarbonate therapy can help to raise the blood pH and improve symptoms of metabolic acidosis.

In this case, the patient's history of alcohol abuse and his presentation with new-onset heart failure suggest that he may have thiamine deficiency. Thiamine therapy is the first-line treatment for Wernicke's encephalopathy and Korsakoff's syndrome. It is important to start thiamine therapy as soon as possible, as the symptoms of these conditions can worsen rapidly. Therefore, the best course of action in this case is to administer intravenous thiamine therapy.

Explanation:
A simple ranula is a type of cyst that occurs in the floor of the mouth. It is a fluid-filled sac that is caused by blockage of a salivary gland duct. Ranulas are most common in children, but they can occur at any age. They are usually painless and do not require treatment, but they may be removed if they are large or bothersome.

The patient in the case presented with a painless, slowly enlarging, midline neck mass without associated dysphagia, odynophagia, weight loss, or history of infection. The mass was soft, mobile, and compressible in midline level IA, measuring 7 cm and posterior-superiorly displacing the tongue. The mass was visible as a clear blue lesion in the floor of the mouth and was nontender. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of simple ranula.

Epidermoid cysts are benign skin lesions that are caused by the entrapment of skin cells. They are most common on the face, neck, and scalp. Epidermoid cysts are usually small, but they can grow to be large. They are often painless, but they may become irritated or infected.

Vascular malformations are abnormal blood vessels that can occur anywhere in the body. They can be present at birth or they can develop later in life. Vascular malformations can be classified as hemangiomas or malformations. Hemangiomas are benign tumors that usually regress on their own. Malformations are permanent and do not regress.

Odontogenic abscesses are infections that occur in the gums or jawbone. They are usually caused by bacteria that enter the bloodstream through a toothache or gum infection. Odontogenic abscesses can be very painful and may require treatment with antibiotics or surgery.

In conclusion, the patient in the case presented with a history and physical examination that is consistent with a diagnosis of simple ranula. The other options are not as likely based on the information provided.

Cocaine-induced midline destructive lesion (CMDL) is a rare, necrotizing infection of the sinonasal tract that is associated with cocaine use. It is characterized by progressive destruction of the nasal septum and adjacent structures, and can lead to life-threatening complications such as meningitis, cavernous sinus thrombosis, and intracranial hemorrhage.

The diagnosis of CMDL is based on a history of cocaine use, clinical findings, and imaging studies. CT scan of the head typically shows destruction of the nasal septum and adjacent structures. Treatment of CMDL requires aggressive surgical debridement of the necrotic tissue and prolonged antibiotic therapy.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a systemic vasculitis that can involve the sinonasal tract. However, GPA typically presents with multiple, non-contiguous areas of inflammation, in contrast to the single, destructive lesion seen in CMDL.
* Extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type (ENKTL) is a rare lymphoma that can involve the sinonasal tract. However, ENKTL typically presents with a unilateral mass, in contrast to the bilateral disease seen in CMDL.
* Chronic invasive fungal sinusitis is a fungal infection of the sinonasal tract that can be destructive. However, chronic invasive fungal sinusitis typically occurs in patients with underlying immunosuppression, in contrast to the immunocompetent patients who are typically affected by CMDL.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of septic arthritis. The most common bacteria that cause septic arthritis are Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Neisseria gonorrhoeae. In order to confirm the diagnosis and identify the causative organism, it is necessary to obtain joint fluid for bacterial analysis and cultures.

The other options are not as likely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms. Inquire about rodent and other animal exposures is not relevant to the patient's history, as she does not report any recent exposures. Test for Borrelia burgdorferi is not indicated, as the patient does not have any symptoms of Lyme disease, such as a rash that follows the path of a tick bite. Test vesicular fluid for enterovirus is not indicated, as the patient does not have any symptoms of enterovirus infection, such as a vesicular rash.

Therefore, the correct answer is: **B. Obtain joint fluid for bacterial analysis and cultures.**

The patient is a 71-year-old otherwise healthy woman who presented with an enlarging, immobile, painless mass in her right gluteal area. She had no other associated symptoms. On examination, she had a large, palpable, nontender right gluteal mass. She had no neurovascular deficits. Results of laboratory studies were within normal limits. Computed tomography (CT) revealed an 11-cm heterogeneous lipomatous tumor involving the right gluteal musculature.

The most likely diagnosis is a lipoma, which is a benign tumor of fat cells. However, it is important to rule out other possible diagnoses, such as a liposarcoma, which is a malignant tumor of fat cells. The best way to do this is to perform an incisional biopsy of the lesion. This will allow the pathologist to examine the tissue under a microscope and make a definitive diagnosis.

If the biopsy shows that the lesion is a lipoma, then the patient can be reassured that it is a benign tumor and that she does not need any further treatment. However, if the biopsy shows that the lesion is a liposarcoma, then the patient will need further treatment, such as surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy.

A core needle biopsy is not as accurate as an incisional biopsy, and it is not recommended for the diagnosis of a lipoma. Repeat imaging in 6 months is not the best way to manage this patient. The lesion is already 11 cm in size, and it is likely to continue to grow. It is important to obtain a definitive diagnosis as soon as possible so that the patient can receive the appropriate treatment.

The patient presented with a 10-day history of edema and vesicles and bullae on his right cheek, neck, back, both eyelids, and the dorsal surface of his hands. He had been treated for herpes zoster with famciclovir for 1 week, during which the lesions kept developing and were accompanied with irregular fever.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is famciclovir-resistant disseminated herpes zoster. This is supported by the patient's history of herpes zoster, the presence of vesicles and bullae, and the fact that the lesions kept developing despite treatment with famciclovir.

Bullous Sweet syndrome, bullous Wells syndrome, and bullous pemphigoid are all possible diagnoses, but they are less likely than famciclovir-resistant disseminated herpes zoster. Bullous Sweet syndrome is a rare, neutrophilic dermatosis that is characterized by fever, neutrophilic infiltrates in the skin, and the presence of Sweet's papules. Bullous Wells syndrome is a rare, autoimmune blistering disorder that is characterized by the presence of tense blisters on the extremities and trunk. Bullous pemphigoid is a chronic, autoimmune blistering disorder that is characterized by the presence of tense blisters on the skin and mucous membranes.

In the case of the patient in the question, the most likely diagnosis is famciclovir-resistant disseminated herpes zoster. This is supported by the patient's history of herpes zoster, the presence of vesicles and bullae, and the fact that the lesions kept developing despite treatment with famciclovir.

Explanation: The patient has a history of left breast carcinoma that was treated with mastectomy, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. She has been experiencing pain, swelling, and erythema on her face for 3 months. On physical examination, she has violaceous swelling with telangiectasia and necrosis on the forehead, eyelids, nose, and cheek, predominantly involving the left side of the face. A biopsy of the lesion was performed and showed metastatic breast carcinoma.

Cutaneous angiosarcoma is a rare, malignant tumor of endothelial cells that line blood vessels. It most commonly occurs in the skin of the head and neck, and is more common in older adults. Radiation dermatitis is a skin reaction that can occur after radiation therapy. It is characterized by redness, swelling, and flaking of the skin. Wolf isotopic response is a rare, benign skin condition that can occur after exposure to radioactive isotopes. It is characterized by telangiectasia, erythema, and edema of the skin.

The patient's history and physical examination are most consistent with a diagnosis of telangiectatic metastatic breast carcinoma. The biopsy of the lesion showed metastatic breast carcinoma, which is further evidence of the diagnosis.

The patient has a history of hepatitis C, cirrhosis, and an orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) 3 years prior that was subsequently treated with tacrolimus, 5 mg, and mycophenolate, 750 mg, twice daily. Approximately 2½ years after the transplant, the patient developed gastric outlet obstruction secondary to an infiltrative gastric wall mass. The gastric wall mass was found to be associated with plasmablastic posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder (pPTLD). He was subsequently instructed to stop use of mycophenolate and decrease use of tacrolimus to 0.25 mg daily, then treated with 1 cycle of CHOP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine sulfate, and prednisone) and lenalidomide, resulting in symptomatic and radiologic improvement. Five weeks after treatment with CHOP chemotherapy, the patient presented with an acute-onset abdominal skin eruption without fever or pain. A computed tomographic scan of the abdomen and pelvis showed possible abdominal wall cellulitis, so treatment with piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin was empirically started. Physical examination revealed confluent indurated violaceous papules and plaques coalescing into an annular pattern encircling the healed OLT incisional scar with central sparing. A 4-mm punch biopsy specimen was obtained for histopathological evaluation and bacterial and fungal cultures.

The patient's history of hepatitis C, cirrhosis, and an OLT, as well as his development of gastric outlet obstruction secondary to an infiltrative gastric wall mass, are all risk factors for pPTLD. The development of an abdominal skin eruption 5 weeks after treatment with CHOP chemotherapy is also consistent with pPTLD. The histopathological findings of the punch biopsy specimen, which showed an atypical, hyperchromatic infiltrate present throughout the superficial and deep dermis, are also consistent with pPTLD.

The differential diagnosis for the patient's abdominal skin eruption includes reactive granulomatous disorder, deep fungal infection, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. However, the patient's history, physical examination, and histopathological findings are most consistent with pPTLD.

Reactive granulomatous disorder is a non-neoplastic disorder characterized by the formation of granulomas in response to an inflammatory stimulus. It is most commonly seen in the lungs, but can also occur in other organs, including the skin. The granulomas in reactive granulomatous disorder are typically non-necrotic and do not contain atypical cells.

Deep fungal infection is a serious infection that can occur in immunocompromised patients, including those who have undergone an OLT. The most common deep fungal infections in this population are aspergillosis, candidiasis, and cryptococcosis. The skin lesions in deep fungal infections are typically papules, nodules, or ulcers. They may be single or multiple, and can be associated with fever, chills, and other systemic symptoms.

Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that originates in the skin. It is most common in older adults, and is more common in men than women. The skin lesions in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma are typically papules, plaques, or tumors. They may be single or multiple, and can be associated with itching, burning, and pain.

In conclusion, the patient's abdominal skin eruption is most consistent with pPTLD.

 36%|███▌      | 545/1525 [2:05:45<3:39:32, 13.44s/it]Answer: D. Pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis

Explanation: The patient presents with a history of gait imbalance, which is a common symptom of multiple sclerosis. The patient also has a history of strokelike episodes, which are another common symptom of multiple sclerosis. The patient's MRI scan shows bilateral, symmetric, restricted diffusion, with T2 hyperintensities in the supratentorial white matter and corpus callosum, which are characteristic findings of multiple sclerosis. The patient's lumbar puncture shows normal cell counts and no oligoclonal bands or evidence of infection, which helps to rule out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms. The patient's family history is also suggestive of multiple sclerosis, as the patient's mother has a history of diminished reflexes, hand tremor, and balance issues. The patient's younger brother also has similar gait abnormalities.

Mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS) is a genetic disorder that can cause strokelike episodes, seizures, developmental delays, and other neurological problems. MELAS is caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA, which is the DNA that is found in the mitochondria, the energy-producing organelles in cells. MELAS is not typically associated with gait abnormalities.

Metachromatic leukodystrophy is a rare genetic disorder that can cause progressive degeneration of the white matter in the brain and spinal cord. Metachromatic leukodystrophy is caused by mutations in the ARSA gene, which codes for an enzyme that is involved in the production of myelin, the fatty substance that insulates nerve fibers. Metachromatic leukodystrophy is not typically associated with gait abnormalities.

X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT) is a group of genetic disorders that can cause progressive degeneration of the peripheral nerves. CMT is caused by mutations in genes that are involved in the production of myelin or the maintenance of the structure of nerve fibers. CMT is not typically associated with strokelike episodes.

Pediatric-onset multiple sclerosis (POMS) is a rare form of multiple sclerosis that occurs in children and adolescents. POMS is characterized by a relapsing-remitting course, with periods of disease activity followed by periods of remission. POMS is caused by inflammation and demyelination of the central nervous system. The symptoms of POMS can vary from person to person, but can include fatigue, weakness, numbness, tingling, visual disturbances, and problems with balance and coordination. POMS is a serious condition that can have a significant impact on a child's quality of life. However, there are treatments available that can help to manage the symptoms of POMS and improve a child's quality of life.

The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with neurosyphilis, a late complication of untreated syphilis. Neurosyphilis can cause a variety of visual symptoms, including blurry vision, optic neuritis, and retinal vasculitis. The patient's mildly reactive fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test supports the diagnosis of neurosyphilis.

Intravenous penicillin is the treatment of choice for neurosyphilis. It is important to start treatment as soon as possible to prevent further damage to the nervous system. The patient should be monitored closely for improvement in his vision and other symptoms.

A, B, and C are incorrect because they are not the appropriate treatment for neurosyphilis. Bilateral posterior sub-Tenon triamcinolone injections and increasing the dose of oral prednisone are treatments for uveitis, which is not a likely diagnosis in this case. Antiviral therapy is not indicated for neurosyphilis.

Explanation:
The patient in this case has bilateral papilledema and progressive visual loss in the right eye, which deteriorated to blindness in 3 months. She has a 4-year history of Behçet disease (BD), and her condition has been stabilized with thalidomide. Her optic neuropathy of BD has been treated with high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone for 4 days followed by oral prednisone for a month without improvement.

The most likely cause of the patient's visual loss is optic nerve compression due to a mass lesion in the brain. This is supported by the findings of papilledema, which is swelling of the optic nerve head, and a partially empty sella, which is a defect in the sella turcica, the bony structure that houses the pituitary gland.

The next step in the management of this patient is to obtain cerebral magnetic resonance venography (MRV) or computed tomographic venography (CTV) to rule out a mass lesion. If a mass lesion is found, the next step would be to obtain a biopsy to determine the underlying cause. Treatment would then be directed at the underlying cause.

Increasing the prednisone dose or adding an immunosuppressant to corticosteroid therapy would not be the next step in the management of this patient. These interventions would not be expected to improve the patient's visual loss if the cause is a mass lesion.

Performing catheter cerebral angiography is not necessary in the management of this patient. This procedure is used to visualize the blood vessels in the brain, but it would not be helpful in diagnosing or treating the patient's underlying condition.

The patient in the case has bilateral atypical epiretinal membranes, which are a rare condition that can be caused by genetic factors. Obtaining a family medical history and genetic testing will help to determine if the patient has a genetic predisposition to this condition. If the patient does have a genetic predisposition, then she may be at increased risk for developing other eye problems in the future. Early detection and treatment of these problems can help to preserve the patient's vision.

The other options are not as appropriate in this case. Option B, recommending pars plana vitrectomy with epiretinal membrane peel, is a surgical procedure that is used to treat epiretinal membranes. However, this procedure is not typically recommended for patients with atypical epiretinal membranes, as it is not as effective in treating this condition as it is in treating other types of epiretinal membranes. Option C, observing the lesions, is not a good option because atypical epiretinal membranes can cause progressive vision loss. Option D, giving an intravitreal ocriplasmin injection, is a treatment that is used to treat macular edema, which is a condition that can be caused by epiretinal membranes. However, this treatment is not effective in treating atypical epiretinal membranes.

In conclusion, the correct answer is A. Obtain a family medical history and genetic testing.

The patient has a conjunctival lesion that is solid and noncompressible, with no history of trauma. These findings are concerning for a malignancy. A conjunctival biopsy is the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis and determine the appropriate treatment.

Topical corticosteroid eyedrops would be appropriate for a non-neoplastic conjunctival lesion, such as an inflammatory process. However, they would not be effective for a malignancy.

A complete blood cell count, basic metabolic panel, and liver function tests are not specific for malignancy and would not be helpful in making the diagnosis.

Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a common cause of corneal ulcers. The patient in this case has a number of risk factors for HSV keratitis, including alcoholism, a corneal epithelial defect, and diminished corneal sensation. The patient's clinical presentation is also consistent with HSV keratitis, with a large, well-demarcated epithelial defect with underlying stromal loss.

Tissue culture and antigen detection tests are the most sensitive and specific methods for diagnosing HSV keratitis. These tests should be performed in all cases of suspected HSV keratitis, as early diagnosis and treatment are important to prevent corneal scarring and vision loss.

Broadening antibiotic coverage to include vancomycin and tobramycin is not necessary in this case, as the patient has not responded to treatment with moxifloxacin. In addition, there is no evidence of bacterial infection in this patient.

Obtaining serum vitamin A levels is not necessary in this case, as there is no evidence of vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A deficiency is a rare cause of corneal ulcers, and it is not a risk factor for HSV keratitis.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. Obtain herpes simplex virus tissue culture and antigen detection tests.

The patient's clinical history and physical examination findings are consistent with nivolumab-induced extensive panniculitis. The patient had a history of melanoma and had been receiving nivolumab therapy for 11 cycles. She developed progressive painful reddening and swelling of the left thigh, which is a typical presentation of nivolumab-induced panniculitis. The patient's FDG-PET-CT scan showed multiple FDG-active lesions in both lower extremities and the lumbar region, which is also consistent with nivolumab-induced panniculitis. The patient's biopsy specimen revealed a lobular lymphocytic panniculitis with dense infiltrate of mainly lymphocytes and plasma cells, which is a characteristic finding of nivolumab-induced panniculitis.

The other possible diagnoses are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Disease progression: The patient's clinical history and physical examination findings are not consistent with disease progression. The patient's melanoma was classified as stage IIA at diagnosis, and she had undergone inguinal lymphadenectomy and adjuvant immunotherapy with ipilimumab. She had been receiving nivolumab therapy for 11 cycles without any evidence of disease progression.
* Cold panniculitis: Cold panniculitis is a rare, autoimmune disorder that is characterized by inflammation of the subcutaneous fat. It is typically triggered by cold exposure, and it is not associated with immunotherapy.
* Erythema nodosum: Erythema nodosum is a common, non-specific inflammatory disorder that is characterized by tender, red nodules on the shins. It is often associated with infections, inflammatory bowel disease, and certain medications, but it is not associated with immunotherapy.

Explanation:
The patient is presenting with acute shortness of breath, which is a concerning symptom. The patient has a history of mechanical mitral valve replacement and aortic dissection repair, which are both risk factors for aortic dissection. The physical examination findings of elevated jugular venous pressure, bilateral rales in her lungs, and reduced intensity of the mitral valve closure sound are all consistent with aortic dissection. The echocardiographic image showing a mean gradient of 12 mm Hg across the mitral valve, along with fluoroscopy showing restricted mobility of the leaflets, are both consistent with mitral valve stenosis. Transesophageal echocardiography showing a large thrombus on the mechanical mitral valve, along with a small new dissection flap in the aortic root, is highly concerning for aortic dissection. A chronic dissection flap was evident in the aortic arch and descending aorta, which was unchanged from the previous aortic dissection repair.

Given the patient's history, physical examination findings, and imaging studies, the most likely diagnosis is acute aortic dissection. The treatment for acute aortic dissection is surgical repair of the dissection. In this case, the patient should be referred to a surgeon for evaluation and possible aortic root dissection repair.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Option B, starting intravenous heparin, is not appropriate because the patient has a mechanical mitral valve. Heparin can cause anticoagulation of the mechanical valve, which can lead to thromboembolic complications. Option C, administering a full dose of emergency tissue plasminogen activator, is not appropriate because the patient has a mechanical mitral valve. Tissue plasminogen activator can cause thrombolysis of the thrombus on the mechanical valve, which can lead to thromboembolic complications. Option D, performing emergency percutaneous clot removal, is not appropriate because the patient has a mechanical mitral valve. Percutaneous clot removal can cause dislodgement of the thrombus from the mechanical valve, which can lead to thromboembolic complications.

Explanation:
The patient has a large, right supraorbital mass with bony destruction of the anterior table of the right frontal sinus. It extended into the superior aspect of the orbit, displacing the right globe inferiorly. Air was seen within the mass. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy yielded inconclusive results. After medical clearance, the patient was taken to the operating room for a wedge excisional biopsy with decompression of the right supraorbital mass under monitored anesthesia care. Histopathological investigation revealed large nests of neoplastic epithelioid cells surrounded by fibrotic tissue and necroinflammatory debris. The neoplastic cells contained round nuclei with single prominent nucleoli and abundant clear to vacuolated cytoplasm.

The most likely diagnosis is sebaceous carcinoma. Sebaceous carcinoma is a rare, aggressive neoplasm that arises from the sebaceous glands of the skin. It is most commonly seen in the head and neck region, and it is often misdiagnosed as basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma. Sebaceous carcinoma is a locally destructive tumor that can metastasize to distant sites, including the lungs, liver, and brain. The treatment of sebaceous carcinoma is surgical excision with wide margins. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy may also be used in some cases.

The other possible diagnoses are not consistent with the patient's clinical presentation. Pott puffy tumor is a benign, inflammatory lesion that is caused by infection of the frontal sinus. Mucocele is a benign, cystic lesion that is caused by obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct. Basal cell carcinoma is a slow-growing, locally invasive neoplasm that arises from the basal cells of the epidermis. Squamous cell carcinoma is a more aggressive neoplasm that can metastasize to distant sites.

 36%|███▋      | 555/1525 [2:08:05<3:39:20, 13.57s/it]The correct answer is A: Prostate cancer with brain metastasis.

The patient is a 46-year-old African male who presented with a 1-month history of progressive left hearing loss and vertigo. He also reported asthenia, sleep disorders, and urinary frequency. The urinary frequency has been treated for 2 years with many drugs (tamsulosin, desmopressin, and solifenacin) without improvement. The patient had spent his childhood in eastern Africa, where he swam in Lake Tanganyika. His history did not reveal trauma, infection, or any other associated conditions at the onset of the complaints.

The ear, nose, and throat examination revealed a right horizontal nystagmus and a poorly delineated hypoesthesia of the left pinna. He could not walk properly owing to his vertigo. The rest of the clinical examination findings were unremarkable. Additional examinations (ie, pure-tone audiometry, video nystagmography, tympanometry) revealed left profound hearing loss with an air-bone gap of 40 dB and central vertigo. Otoacoustic emissions were absent on the left side. There was no left acoustic reflex. Auditory brainstem responses showed asymmetric interpeak latencies of waves I through V and III through V, suggesting slower conduction on the left side. Computed tomography and cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 24 × 20-mm hemorrhagic lesion in the left middle cerebellar peduncle associated with a thickening of the cochleovestibular nerve. The patient was referred to urology, where a 13 × 8-mm mass was discovered in the lateral wall of the prostate gland. Biopsies of prostate and brain lesions, blood tests, and urinalysis were performed.

The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of prostate cancer with brain metastasis. The patient's age, African ethnicity, and history of swimming in Lake Tanganyika are all risk factors for prostate cancer. The patient's symptoms of hearing loss, vertigo, and urinary frequency are all consistent with central nervous system metastasis. The patient's imaging studies show a hemorrhagic lesion in the left middle cerebellar peduncle, which is a common site of metastasis for prostate cancer. The patient's biopsy results confirm the presence of prostate cancer cells in the brain lesion.

The differential diagnosis for the patient's symptoms includes tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis, and schistosomiasis. However, these diseases are less common in African men than prostate cancer. Additionally, the patient's imaging studies do not show any evidence of tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis, or schistosomiasis.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for the patient is prostate cancer with brain metastasis.

Explanation: The patient presents with asymptomatic, reddish, raised lesions over his right ear, noticed 3 months earlier, associated with multiple painless swellings on the ipsilateral side of the neck for the past 3 weeks. The lesions have healed with atrophic scarring after 6 weeks of treatment. The histopathological examination shows granulomatous inflammation and central caseous necrosis in the dermis. The Ziehl-Neelsen stain shows acid-fast bacilli. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of fixed cutaneous sporotrichosis.

Fixed cutaneous sporotrichosis is a chronic granulomatous infection caused by the fungus Sporothrix schenckii. The infection is typically acquired through contact with soil or decaying organic matter. The most common presentation is a single, painless, erythematous nodule on the skin. The nodule may ulcerate and drain, and it may be associated with regional lymphadenopathy. The diagnosis is confirmed by histopathological examination or culture of the organism. Treatment is with oral antifungal therapy, such as itraconazole or fluconazole.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Lupus vulgaris is a chronic granulomatous skin disease caused by the immune system attacking its own tissues. It typically presents as a single, reddish-brown plaque on the face or neck. The lesions are often raised and have a characteristic "apple-jelly" appearance. Lupus vulgaris is not associated with lymphadenopathy.
* Atypical mycobacterial infection is a group of infections caused by mycobacteria other than Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The most common presentation is a chronic, nodular skin lesion. The lesions may be associated with lymphadenopathy. The diagnosis is confirmed by histopathological examination or culture of the organism. Treatment is with antimycobacterial therapy.
* Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a parasitic infection caused by the protozoan Leishmania. The most common presentation is a single, reddish-brown nodule on the skin. The lesions are often raised and have a characteristic "punched-out" appearance. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is not associated with lymphadenopathy.

Explanation: The patient is presenting with fever, headache, and neck stiffness, which are concerning for meningitis. The patient also has a history of kidney transplant, which puts him at increased risk for infection. The MRI of the spine showed cervical degenerative changes with reactive marrow, which is consistent with infection. The blood and CSF cultures were negative, but this is not unexpected early in the course of infection. The patient should continue to receive intravenous antibiotics until the infection has resolved.

The other options are incorrect because:

* Option B, obtaining additional imaging with computed tomography (CT), is not necessary at this time. The MRI of the spine has already shown cervical degenerative changes with reactive marrow, which is consistent with infection.
* Option C, starting gabapentin, is not indicated for meningitis. Gabapentin is a medication used to treat nerve pain, and it would not be effective for treating infection.
* Option D, starting high-dose ibuprofen, is not indicated for meningitis. Ibuprofen is a medication used to reduce fever and pain, but it would not be effective for treating infection.

Explanation:

Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a vasculitis that affects large and medium-sized arteries, most commonly the temporal arteries. It is a systemic disease that can affect multiple organ systems, including the eyes, kidneys, and heart.

The classic presentation of GCA is a new-onset, severe headache, typically located in the temporal region. Other common symptoms include scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, fever, and weight loss.

The diagnosis of GCA is based on a combination of clinical features, laboratory findings, and imaging studies. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a non-specific marker of inflammation that is often elevated in GCA. A temporal artery biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis, but it is not always necessary.

In the case of a patient with a high clinical suspicion of GCA who has a normal temporal artery biopsy, the next step is to obtain a brain MRI. This is to rule out other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, such as a stroke or a tumor.

Empirical methotrexate prescription is not appropriate in this case because the patient does not have a confirmed diagnosis of GCA. Empirical sumatriptan prescription is not appropriate in this case because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a migraine. Serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) is not a useful test in the diagnosis of GCA.

Explanation:

The patient's presentation is most consistent with granulomatous cheilitis. Granulomatous cheilitis is a chronic inflammatory condition of the lips characterized by the presence of multiple erythematous papules and nodules. The lesions are typically bilateral and symmetric, and they may extend onto the vermilion border. Granulomatous cheilitis is most commonly seen in middle-aged and elderly men, and it is thought to be caused by an allergic reaction to a variety of stimuli, including dental materials, toothpaste, and cosmetics. The diagnosis of granulomatous cheilitis is based on the clinical presentation and biopsy findings. Treatment is typically aimed at the underlying cause of the inflammation, and it may include topical steroids, oral steroids, or surgical excision of the lesions.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Leukemia labialis is a rare condition characterized by the infiltration of the lips with leukemic cells. The lesions are typically purpuric or violaceous, and they may be associated with ulceration. Leukemia labialis is most commonly seen in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
* Lip licker’s dermatitis is a chronic inflammatory condition of the lips caused by chronic lip licking. The lesions are typically erythematous and scaling, and they may be associated with fissuring and crusting. Lip licker’s dermatitis is most commonly seen in children and young adults.
* Pyostomatitis vegetans is a rare, chronic, inflammatory condition of the lips and oral mucosa characterized by the presence of multiple vegetating ulcers. Pyostomatitis vegetans is most commonly seen in patients with Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis.

Explanation:

Erdheim-Chester disease is a rare, non-Langerhans cell histiocytic disorder characterized by the infiltration of foamy macrophages and multinucleated giant cells into the retroperitoneum, mediastinum, and other organs. It is a systemic disease that can affect multiple organ systems, including the kidneys, heart, lungs, and bones. The most common symptoms are abdominal pain, back pain, fatigue, and weight loss. Diagnosis is made based on clinical presentation, imaging studies, and biopsy findings. There is no cure for Erdheim-Chester disease, but treatment with corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive drugs can help to control the symptoms and slow the progression of the disease.

The patient in the case presented with a right lower-eyelid yellow plaque, unremitting abdominal and back pain, and a CT scan that showed extensive infiltrative stranding from the thorax through the retroperitoneal space. These findings are consistent with Erdheim-Chester disease. The patient's biopsy of the lower-eyelid yellow plaque returned xanthelasma, which is a benign condition that is not associated with Erdheim-Chester disease. The patient's second retroperitoneal biopsy exhibited fibroadipose tissue, foamy macrophages, and chronic inflammation with fibrosis, which are all characteristic findings of Erdheim-Chester disease. The patient's clinical presentation and biopsy findings were confirmed with a molecular test.

Necrobiotic xanthogranuloma is a rare, inflammatory disorder that typically affects the skin, bones, and eyes. It is characterized by the presence of necrobiotic granulomas, which are areas of inflammation and necrosis. The patient in the case did not have any skin lesions or eye involvement, which makes necrobiotic xanthogranuloma an unlikely diagnosis.

Xanthelasma palpebrum is a benign condition that is characterized by the accumulation of cholesterol-rich deposits in the eyelids. It is most commonly seen in adults, and it is more common in women than men. The patient in the case had a right lower-eyelid yellow plaque, which is a characteristic finding of xanthelasma palpebrum. However, the patient also had other symptoms that are consistent with Erdheim-Chester disease, such as abdominal pain, back pain, and fatigue. Additionally, the patient's biopsy of the lower-eyelid yellow plaque returned xanthelasma, which is a benign condition that is not associated with Erdheim-Chester disease.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare, non-cancerous disorder that affects the immune system. It is characterized by the proliferation of Langerhans cells, which are a type of white blood cell. The patient in the case did not have any of the typical symptoms of Langerhans cell histiocytosis, such as bone pain, skin lesions, or lymphadenopathy. Additionally, the patient's biopsy findings were not consistent with Langerhans cell histiocytosis.

Explanation:

CADASIL is a rare, inherited disorder that affects the blood vessels in the brain. It causes small strokes and white matter lesions in the brain, which can lead to a variety of neurological symptoms, including transient neurological symptoms, migraine headaches, and hearing loss.

The patient in this case has a history of episodic migraine with visual aura, which is a common symptom of CADASIL. She also has new intermittent vertigo, more frequent and severe throbbing migraine with transient blurry vision and nonpulsatile tinnitus, and hearing loss with a robotic quality of auditory perception. These symptoms are consistent with the neurological problems that can be caused by CADASIL.

The patient's brain MRI shows multiple white-matter lesions that are hyperintense on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), including some with enhancement, as well as a small DWI-negative lesion in the left thalamus and corpus callosum that was hyperintense on T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging (FLAIR). These findings are also consistent with CADASIL.

The patient's lumbar puncture results are normal, which rules out multiple sclerosis. Her infectious, rheumatologic, and hypercoaguable test results are also negative, which rules out other possible causes of her symptoms.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is CADASIL.

 37%|███▋      | 563/1525 [2:10:06<3:58:58, 14.90s/it]The correct answer is **D: Start a course of oral corticosteroids.**

The patient's presentation is consistent with acute macular neuroretinopathy (AMN), a rare disorder that is characterized by the sudden onset of visual disturbances, including photopsia, scotoma, and metamorphopsia. AMN is thought to be caused by an autoimmune reaction against the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and it is often associated with systemic autoimmune disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sjögren's syndrome.

The treatment of AMN is controversial, but there is some evidence that oral corticosteroids can be beneficial. A study by Pavesio et al. (2003) found that patients with AMN who were treated with oral corticosteroids had significantly better visual outcomes than those who were not treated.

In the patient described in the case, the history of migraine and polycystic ovaries suggests that she may have an underlying autoimmune disorder. The presence of photopsia, scotoma, and metamorphopsia in both eyes is also consistent with AMN. The near-infrared reflectance imaging and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans of the right eye show hyporeflective teardrop-shaped lesions and increased reflectivity of the outer plexiform layer, which are characteristic findings of AMN.

Based on the above information, the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is to start a course of oral corticosteroids. The goal of treatment is to suppress the autoimmune reaction and prevent further damage to the retina. The patient should be monitored closely for signs of improvement, and the dose of corticosteroids should be tapered as soon as possible.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Option A, fluorescein angiography, is a diagnostic test that can be used to visualize the blood vessels in the retina. However, it is not necessary to diagnose AMN, and it would not be helpful in the management of this patient. Option B, observing the patient, is not appropriate because AMN is a progressive disorder that can lead to permanent vision loss. Option C, performing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, is not necessary to diagnose AMN. MRI may be helpful in ruling out other causes of visual disturbances, such as multiple sclerosis, but it is not necessary in this case.

The patient has multiple risk factors for central retinal vein occlusion, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia. The patient's history of fevers, night sweats, chills, and petechiae is concerning for an underlying systemic infection, such as bacterial endocarditis. Bacterial endocarditis can lead to retinal ischemia and hemorrhage, which can mimic the presentation of central retinal vein occlusion.

A fluorescein angiogram is a test that can be used to visualize the blood vessels in the retina. It is the gold standard for diagnosing central retinal vein occlusion and can also be used to assess the degree of ischemia. In this case, a fluorescein angiogram would help to confirm the diagnosis of central retinal vein occlusion and to determine the extent of the ischemia. This information would be helpful in planning treatment for the patient.

Providing the patient with stool softeners to prevent recurrence of Valsalva retinopathy is not the most appropriate next step. Valsalva retinopathy is a rare condition that can occur when the blood pressure in the eye is increased suddenly, such as during a bowel movement. It is not a likely explanation for the patient's presentation.

Immediately beginning intravenous antibiotics before any blood draws and consulting cardiology for likely bacterial endocarditis is also not the most appropriate next step. The patient's history and physical examination do not suggest that he has bacterial endocarditis. It is important to rule out other causes of the patient's symptoms before starting antibiotics.

Drawing a complete blood cell count with differential to evaluate for leukemic retinopathy or blood dyscrasia is also not the most appropriate next step. The patient's history and physical examination do not suggest that he has leukemic retinopathy or a blood dyscrasia. These conditions are rare and are not likely to be the cause of the patient's symptoms.

The patient has a pigmented lesion at the temporal limbus from 3 to 4 o’clock with a 2-mm extension into the cornea. Some opalescence underlies the pigment on the cornea. In addition, there was an adjacent small area of flat, superficial, mobile bulbar conjunctival pigmentation. The anterior segment high-resolution optical coherence tomography (HR-OCT) of the 4-o’clock corneolimbal lesion of the left eye demonstrated thickened hyperreflective corneal epithelium with an abrupt transition from normal to abnormal. These findings are highly suggestive of ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN), which is a precancerous condition. The best way to diagnose OSSN is with a biopsy. A biopsy will allow the doctor to determine if the lesion is malignant or benign. If the lesion is malignant, the doctor can then recommend the best course of treatment.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Option A is not necessary because there is no evidence that the lesion has metastasized. Option C is not recommended because cryotherapy can cause scarring and other complications. Option D is not appropriate because doxycycline is an antibiotic that is not effective against OSSN.

In conclusion, the best course of action for this patient is to biopsy the conjunctival and corneal lesion. This will allow the doctor to determine if the lesion is malignant or benign and recommend the best course of treatment.

The patient has been diagnosed with giant papillary conjunctivitis, which is a chronic condition that is often associated with soft contact lens wear. The mainstay of treatment for giant papillary conjunctivitis is the use of topical steroids. In this case, the patient has already been treated with a 2-week course of prednisolone acetate, 1%, twice a day. However, his symptoms have not completely resolved. Therefore, it is reasonable to start a longer trial of topical steroid therapy. In addition, topical antihistamines can be used to help relieve the itching associated with giant papillary conjunctivitis.

Option A is incorrect because oral azithromycin is not a first-line treatment for giant papillary conjunctivitis. Oral azithromycin is typically used to treat bacterial infections, such as chlamydia and gonorrhea. In this case, the patient has already been tested for these infections and the results were negative. Therefore, there is no reason to believe that he has a bacterial infection.

Option C is incorrect because conjunctival biopsy is not typically necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of giant papillary conjunctivitis. Conjunctival biopsy is typically reserved for cases in which the diagnosis is uncertain or when there is suspicion of a malignancy. In this case, the diagnosis of giant papillary conjunctivitis is clear and there is no evidence of a malignancy. Therefore, conjunctival biopsy is not necessary.

Option D is incorrect because chest radiography and an angiotensin-converting enzyme serum level test are not typically necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of giant papillary conjunctivitis. Chest radiography and an angiotensin-converting enzyme serum level test are typically used to evaluate for pulmonary sarcoidosis, which is a rare condition that can cause conjunctivitis. In this case, there is no evidence that the patient has pulmonary sarcoidosis. Therefore, chest radiography and an angiotensin-converting enzyme serum level test are not necessary.

The patient in this case has several risk factors for hypertensive retinopathy, including a history of hypertension, acute kidney failure, and non–ST-elevation myocardial infarction. Hypertensive retinopathy is a condition in which high blood pressure damages the blood vessels in the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. This damage can lead to blurred vision, blind spots, and even blindness.

The first step in treating hypertensive retinopathy is to control the patient's blood pressure. This can be done with medication, lifestyle changes, or a combination of both. Once the patient's blood pressure is under control, the next step is to work up the underlying cause of the hypertension. This may include blood tests, imaging studies, or other tests.

In some cases, hypertensive retinopathy may progress even with treatment. If this happens, the patient may need additional treatment, such as laser therapy or surgery.

The other options are incorrect because they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's condition. Performing blood tests for neuroretinitis would be appropriate if the patient had symptoms of neuroretinitis, such as blurred vision, pain in the eye, and a red eye. However, the patient in this case does not have any of these symptoms. Performing magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance venogram of the brain and orbits, then perform lumbar puncture would be appropriate if the patient had symptoms of a brain tumor or other central nervous system disorder. However, the patient in this case does not have any of these symptoms.

Explanation:

Cutaneous lupus erythematosus (CLE) is a chronic, autoimmune skin disease that can affect people of all ages, but is most common in women of childbearing age. It is characterized by a variety of skin lesions, including erythematous macules, papules, and plaques. The lesions can occur anywhere on the body, but are most common on the face, neck, and extremities. CLE can be a mild, self-limiting disease, or it can be a severe, chronic condition that requires lifelong treatment.

The most common symptoms of CLE are:

* Erythematous macules, papules, and plaques on the skin
* Scaly, red skin on the face
* Photosensitivity (sensitivity to sunlight)
* Joint pain and swelling
* Fatigue
* Hair loss
* Mouth ulcers

The cause of CLE is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disease. This means that the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. In the case of CLE, the immune system attacks the skin cells.

There is no cure for CLE, but there are treatments that can help to control the symptoms. The most common treatment is topical corticosteroids, which are applied to the skin to reduce inflammation. Other treatments that may be used include oral corticosteroids, ultraviolet light therapy, and immunosuppressants.

The prognosis for people with CLE varies depending on the severity of the disease. With treatment, most people with CLE can live normal, active lives. However, some people with CLE may experience long-term health problems, such as scarring, hair loss, and joint pain.

The patient in the case study presents with a number of features that are consistent with a diagnosis of CLE. These include:

* Erythematous macules and papules on the trunk and limbs
* Photosensitivity (worsening of the rash after exposure to sunlight)
* Mild lymphocytosis (an increase in the number of lymphocytes in the blood)
* A normal epidermis (the outermost layer of skin) with a pericapillary infiltrate of small lymphocytes restricted to the dermis (the layer of skin below the epidermis)

The absence of leukocytoclastic vasculitis, fungal organisms, or dermal mucin in the skin biopsy specimen further supports a diagnosis of CLE.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* T-cell prolymphocytic leukemia is a type of leukemia that is characterized by an increase in the number of T-lymphocytes in the blood. The patient in the case study does not have any features of leukemia, such as anemia, thrombocytopenia, or leukocytosis.
* Advanced cutaneous T-cell lymphoma/Sézary syndrome is a type of lymphoma that is characterized by an increase in the number of Sézary cells in the blood. Sézary cells are a type of T-lymphocyte that has a characteristic appearance on a blood smear. The patient in the case study does not have any features of Sézary syndrome.
* Polycythemia rubra vera is a myeloproliferative disorder that is characterized by an increase in the number of red blood cells in the blood. The patient in the case study does not have any features of polycythemia rubra vera, such as a high hemoglobin level, a high hematocrit, or a splenomegaly (enlargement of the spleen).

This is consistent with a diagnosis of giant cell arteritis (GCA), a systemic vasculitis that can affect the coronary arteries. GCA is typically treated with high-dose corticosteroids, which can help to reduce inflammation and prevent further damage to the arteries. In some cases, immunosuppressant therapy may also be necessary.

Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) are invasive procedures that are typically reserved for patients with more advanced disease. In this case, the patient's disease is still relatively early, so it is likely that he would respond well to high-dose corticosteroid therapy. PCI or CABG would only be considered if the patient's condition did not improve with medical therapy.

It is important to note that GCA is a serious condition that can be fatal if not treated promptly. If you are experiencing any of the symptoms of GCA, such as headache, jaw pain, fever, and vision problems, it is important to see a doctor right away.

Explanation:

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is squamous cell carcinoma. The patient is an older male with a history of bipolar disorder, which are risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma. The patient also has a 4- to 5-cm pedunculated, ulcerative mass on the dorsal oral aspect of the tongue near midline, anterior to the foramen cecum, without palpable cervical lymphadenopathy. These findings are consistent with squamous cell carcinoma.

Oral eosinophilic ulcer is a less likely diagnosis. Oral eosinophilic ulcer is a rare condition that typically presents as a single, painful ulcer on the buccal mucosa or tongue. The patient in this case has a larger, pedunculated mass, which is more consistent with squamous cell carcinoma.

Abscess is also a less likely diagnosis. Abscesses are typically caused by bacterial infection and are often associated with fever, chills, and pain. The patient in this case does not have these symptoms, and the CT scan does not show any evidence of abscess.

Pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma is a very rare type of cancer that typically occurs in children. It is not a common diagnosis in adults, and it is not consistent with the patient's history and physical examination findings.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is squamous cell carcinoma.

 38%|███▊      | 572/1525 [2:12:02<3:35:10, 13.55s/it]The correct answer is: **C. Fibrous dysplasia**.

The patient has a history of chronic sinusitis and multiple surgical procedures for osseous lesions in the upper and lower jaws. She presents with left-sided epiphora, purulent drainage, and pain and right-sided jaw pain. Examination using flexible nasal endoscopy revealed bulging of the left lateral nasal wall; imaging revealed a 14-mm, dense, expansile, sclerotic mass with moderate calcifications obstructing the left nasolacrimal duct; a similar 2.3 × 1.8–cm lesion of the right mandibular body; and evidence of previous sinus surgery. Because of these findings, left-sided endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy and sinus surgery was performed. Histologic findings showed a proliferation of highly cellular, fibrous connective tissue and cementum-like hard tissue.

These findings are consistent with fibrous dysplasia, a benign bone disorder characterized by the replacement of normal bone with fibrous tissue. Fibrous dysplasia is often monostotic (affecting only one bone), but can be polyostotic (affecting multiple bones). It is usually diagnosed in children and young adults, and most cases are sporadic (not inherited).

The exact cause of fibrous dysplasia is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a mutation in the GNAS gene, which codes for the Gsα protein. The Gsα protein is a G protein that plays a role in cell signaling. When the GNAS gene is mutated, the Gsα protein becomes overactive, which leads to the proliferation of fibrous tissue.

Fibrodysplasia can affect any bone in the body, but it is most commonly seen in the long bones (such as the femur and tibia), the ribs, and the pelvis. The lesions of fibrous dysplasia are typically painless and slow-growing. However, they can cause problems if they grow large enough to compress nerves, blood vessels, or other organs.

The treatment of fibrous dysplasia depends on the size and location of the lesions. Small lesions that are not causing any problems may not need to be treated. However, larger lesions or lesions that are causing problems may need to be treated with surgery, radiation therapy, or medication.

In the case of the patient described in the question, the diagnosis of fibrous dysplasia is supported by the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging findings. The histologic findings of a proliferation of highly cellular, fibrous connective tissue and cementum-like hard tissue are also consistent with fibrous dysplasia.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging findings. Albers-Schönberg disease is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the excessive deposition of calcium in the bones. Gigantiform cementoma is a benign tumor of the jaw that is composed of cementum-like tissue. Fibrous dysplasia is a much more likely diagnosis than either of these conditions. Polyostotic ossifying fibroma is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple benign bone tumors. This condition is also unlikely in the patient described in the question, as she only has one lesion.

In conclusion, the correct diagnosis for the patient described in the question is fibrous dysplasia.

Explanation:

The patient is a woman in her 60s with a history of smoking and drinking who presents with submucosal masses on her right upper lip. The masses are not painful, do not bleed, and have been present for several weeks. The patient denies any other constitutional symptoms. On physical examination, the patient has right upper lip submucosal masses without any tenderness or mucosal abnormality. The remainder of the otolaryngic examination is unremarkable. A computed tomographic scan of the neck with contrast demonstrates multiple hyperenhancing nodules; the largest is 3 × 7 × 6 mm, with no local bony erosion or cervical lymphadenopathy.

The differential diagnosis for submucosal masses of the upper lip includes basal cell adenoma, basal cell adenocarcinoma, multifocal canalicular adenoma, and adenoid cystic carcinoma. Basal cell adenoma is a benign tumor that typically presents as a solitary mass. Basal cell adenocarcinoma is a malignant tumor that typically presents as multiple masses. Multifocal canalicular adenoma is a rare, benign tumor that typically presents as multiple masses. Adenoid cystic carcinoma is a malignant tumor that typically presents as a solitary mass.

The patient's history of smoking and drinking is a risk factor for basal cell carcinoma. The patient's physical examination findings and the CT scan findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of basal cell adenocarcinoma. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is B. Basal cell adenocarcinoma.

Explanation: The most likely diagnosis is herpes zoster (HZ), a viral infection that causes a painful, blistering rash. The diagnosis is based on the patient's history and physical examination findings. Biopsy of the lesions is usually not necessary to make the diagnosis, but it can be helpful to rule out other possible causes of the rash. Treatment of HZ typically includes oral antiviral medications, such as valacyclovir or acyclovir. Topical medications, such as calamine lotion or hydrocortisone cream, can be used to help relieve the itching and pain. In severe cases, hospitalization may be necessary for intravenous antiviral therapy.

A gluten-free diet is not recommended for the treatment of HZ. Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. It is not a known cause of HZ, and there is no evidence that a gluten-free diet is effective in treating or preventing the condition.

The patient has a history of gastric bypass surgery, which can lead to mesenteric vascular compromise. The patient's symptoms, including severe abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, hematemesis, and a CT scan that shows mesenteric vascular compromise, are consistent with this diagnosis. Highly selective mesenteric angiography is a procedure that can be used to diagnose and treat mesenteric vascular compromise. It involves inserting a catheter into an artery in the groin and then injecting contrast dye into the mesenteric artery. This allows the doctor to visualize the mesenteric artery and see if there is any blockage. If there is a blockage, the doctor can then inject medication into the artery to open up the blockage.

Esophagogastrojejunoscopy is a procedure that allows the doctor to visualize the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine. It is not the best option for this patient because it does not allow the doctor to visualize the mesenteric artery. Exploratory laparotomy is a surgical procedure that involves making an incision in the abdomen and looking directly at the organs. It is not the best option for this patient because it is a more invasive procedure than highly selective mesenteric angiography. Diagnostic laparoscopy is a surgical procedure that involves making a small incision in the abdomen and inserting a laparoscope into the abdomen. A laparoscope is a thin, flexible tube with a camera on the end. It allows the doctor to visualize the organs without making a large incision. It is not the best option for this patient because it does not allow the doctor to visualize the mesenteric artery.

Therefore, the correct answer is: **C. Highly selective mesenteric angiography**.

Explanation:
The patient has pancytopenia, which is a condition in which there are low levels of all three blood cell types: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The bone marrow aspirate shows dyserythropoiesis, which is a condition in which there are abnormal red blood cell precursors in the bone marrow. This suggests that the patient's pancytopenia is due to a bone marrow disorder.

One possible cause of bone marrow disorders is a deficiency of trace elements, such as iron, copper, and zinc. These trace elements are essential for the proper function of the bone marrow. Therefore, the next step in the evaluation of this patient should be to check their serum levels of these trace elements.

If the patient's serum levels of trace elements are low, then they can be treated with supplements. Treatment with supplements can often improve the patient's bone marrow function and lead to an improvement in their pancytopenia.

The other options are not as likely to be the cause of the patient's pancytopenia. Option B, obtaining periodic outpatient complete blood cell counts and treating with supportive transfusions as clinically indicated, is a reasonable option for the management of pancytopenia, but it is not the next step in the evaluation. Option C, performing endoscopy of upper and lower gastrointestinal tract, is a reasonable option for the evaluation of iron deficiency, but it is not the next step in the evaluation of this patient, as they have already had a bone marrow aspirate that shows dyserythropoiesis. Option D, starting erythropoiesis stimulating agent, is a reasonable option for the treatment of anemia, but it is not the next step in the evaluation of this patient, as they have not yet been diagnosed with anemia.

Explanation:

The patient is a young woman with recurrent bullous eruptions on her forearms. The lesions are round, erythematous, and have central pallor and confluent blisters at the periphery. Older lesions show central crusts. The patient has no history of trauma or self-inflicted injuries. She has been treated with antibiotics and topical steroids, but with no lasting effect. Her family history is without abnormalities. She is vaccinated against varicella zoster virus and is not immunocompromised.

The clinical presentation is most consistent with linear IgA bullous dermatosis, a subepidermal blistering disease characterized by linear deposition of IgA at the basement membrane zone. The disease typically presents in children and young adults, and is more common in females. The lesions are often triggered by trauma, but can also occur spontaneously. The diagnosis is confirmed by direct immunofluorescence, which shows linear deposition of IgA at the basement membrane zone.

Herpes virus infection is a less likely diagnosis, as the patient has no history of exposure to herpes simplex virus or varicella zoster virus. The lesions are also not typical of herpes virus infection, which typically presents with grouped vesicles on an erythematous base.

Cryothermic dermatitis artefacta is also a less likely diagnosis, as the patient has no history of cold exposure or self-inflicted injuries. The lesions are also not typical of cryothermic dermatitis artefacta, which typically presents with linear or reticulate areas of erythema and edema.

Bullous pemphigoid is a less likely diagnosis, as the patient is young and has no history of immunosuppression. The lesions are also not typical of bullous pemphigoid, which typically presents with large, flaccid blisters on the trunk and extremities.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis is linear IgA bullous dermatosis.

Explanation:

Dowling-Degos disease is a rare, chronic, progressive dermatosis characterized by hyperpigmented reticulate lesions on the flexural surfaces of the body. The lesions are typically pruritic and may be associated with systemic symptoms such as fever, malaise, and weight loss. The histopathology of Dowling-Degos disease shows epidermal hyperplasia, acanthosis, and spongiosis, with a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate. The diagnosis of Dowling-Degos disease is made clinically and confirmed by histopathology. There is no specific treatment for Dowling-Degos disease, but treatment options include topical corticosteroids, systemic corticosteroids, and phototherapy. The prognosis for Dowling-Degos disease is variable, with some patients experiencing spontaneous remission and others experiencing progressive disease.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not fit the clinical presentation of the patient. Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis is a chronic, progressive dermatosis characterized by hyperpigmented papules and plaques on the extremities. Prurigo pigmentosa is a chronic, pruritic dermatosis characterized by hyperpigmented papules and plaques on the extensor surfaces of the extremities.

Explanation:

Cystic fibrosis-associated episodic arthritis (CF-EA) is a self-limiting, non-inflammatory arthritis that occurs in up to 20% of patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). It is characterized by recurrent episodes of joint pain and swelling, typically affecting the large joints of the extremities, such as the knees, ankles, and wrists. The episodes are typically short-lived, lasting for a few days to a week, and resolve spontaneously. There is no specific treatment for CF-EA, but symptomatic relief can be obtained with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).

The patient in the case presentation meets the criteria for CF-EA. She has a history of recurrent episodes of joint pain and swelling that are typically short-lived and resolve spontaneously. She also has a diagnosis of CF. The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) is a chronic inflammatory arthritis that affects children. It is characterized by fever, rash, and arthritis. The patient in the case presentation does not have fever or rash.
* Hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy (HPOA) is a condition that affects the bones and joints in people with chronic lung disease. It is characterized by pain, swelling, and tenderness in the bones and joints, especially the hands and feet. The patient in the case presentation does not have any of the symptoms of HPOA.
* Serum sickness-like reaction is an allergic reaction that can occur after exposure to certain medications, such as antibiotics. It is characterized by fever, rash, joint pain, and lymphadenopathy. The patient in the case presentation does not have any of the symptoms of serum sickness-like reaction.

 38%|███▊      | 580/1525 [2:14:04<4:05:31, 15.59s/it]The correct answer is C: Diabetic striatopathy.

Diabetic striatopathy is a rare disorder that is characterized by the degeneration of the striatum, a part of the brain that is involved in movement. It is most commonly seen in people with type 2 diabetes, and it can cause a variety of symptoms, including chorea, which is involuntary, irregular, and rapid movements.

The patient in this case has a long history of type 2 diabetes, and he developed chorea after a period of severe hyperglycemia. He also has other features that are consistent with diabetic striatopathy, such as a T1 hyperintensity in the right caudate head and a lentiform nucleus with no restricted diffusion on brain MRI.

Postinfectious/autoimmune chorea is a disorder that is caused by an infection or an autoimmune reaction. It can cause chorea, but it is more likely to cause other symptoms, such as fever, rash, and joint pain. The patient in this case does not have any of these symptoms, so postinfectious/autoimmune chorea is not a likely diagnosis.

Paraneoplastic chorea is a disorder that is caused by a tumor that produces antibodies that attack the brain. It can cause chorea, but it is more likely to cause other symptoms, such as seizures, weakness, and sensory changes. The patient in this case does not have any of these symptoms, so paraneoplastic chorea is not a likely diagnosis.

Acute stroke is a blockage of blood flow to the brain that can cause a variety of symptoms, including chorea. However, the patient in this case does not have any other symptoms that are consistent with a stroke, such as weakness, numbness, or changes in vision. In addition, the brain MRI showed no evidence of a stroke. Therefore, acute stroke is not a likely diagnosis.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for the patient in this case is diabetic striatopathy.

Explanation: The patient has been experiencing chronic eye redness and pain for 9 months despite treatment with oral corticosteroids and topical corticosteroids. The patient's symptoms are not improving, and she has developed scleral hyperemia. Scleral hyperemia is a sign of inflammation, and it suggests that the patient's uveitis is not adequately controlled. Increasing the dosage of oral corticosteroids is the most appropriate next step in management. Oral corticosteroids are the most effective treatment for uveitis, and they are typically used in high doses initially to control inflammation. Once the inflammation is controlled, the dosage of oral corticosteroids can be tapered slowly.

Options B, C, and D are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate next steps in management. Option B, performing a scleral biopsy, is not necessary in this case. A scleral biopsy is a surgical procedure that is used to diagnose the cause of scleral inflammation. In this case, the patient has already been diagnosed with uveitis, and a scleral biopsy is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Option C, increasing to hourly topical corticosteroid use, is not likely to be effective in controlling the patient's inflammation. Topical corticosteroids are less effective than oral corticosteroids, and they are typically used in combination with oral corticosteroids to treat uveitis. Option D, increasing the dosage of azathioprine to 500 mg daily, is not likely to be effective in controlling the patient's inflammation. Azathioprine is a medication that is used to suppress the immune system. It is typically used in combination with oral corticosteroids to treat uveitis, but it is not as effective as oral corticosteroids.

OCTA is a non-invasive imaging technique that uses light to create cross-sectional images of the retina. It is a newer technology than fluorescein angiography, and it has several advantages. OCTA can provide high-resolution images of the retina, including the inner retina, which is not well-visualized with fluorescein angiography. OCTA can also be used to monitor the progression of retinal diseases, such as macular degeneration.

In this case, the patient has a central scotoma and blurry vision in her right eye. Her medical history is significant for a motor vehicle crash that occurred almost a year earlier, with no direct head trauma or eye injury. On examination, her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/500 OD and 20/30 OS. Anterior segment examination was remarkable for pseudophakia on the right eye and mild cataract in the left. Fundus examination was remarkable for a slightly blunted foveal reflex in the right eye. SD-OCT showed segmental atrophy of the inner retina. Fluorescein angiography was unrevealing.

The most likely cause of the patient's central scotoma is a macular hole. A macular hole is a small, round defect in the macula, which is the part of the retina responsible for central vision. Macular holes can be caused by a number of factors, including trauma, age-related macular degeneration, and inflammation.

OCTA can be used to diagnose and monitor macular holes. OCTA can also be used to guide treatment of macular holes, such as laser therapy or surgery.

In this case, OCTA would be the best test to order next. OCTA can provide high-resolution images of the retina, including the macula. This will allow the doctor to assess the size and location of the macular hole. OCTA can also be used to monitor the progression of the macular hole. This will allow the doctor to determine if the macular hole is getting worse or better. If the macular hole is getting worse, the doctor may recommend treatment, such as laser therapy or surgery.

The other options are not as appropriate in this case. Automated visual field testing is a test that measures the peripheral vision. This test would not be helpful in this case, because the patient's central vision is affected. Full-field electroretinogram is a test that measures the electrical activity of the retina. This test is not as sensitive as OCTA for detecting macular holes. Microperimetry is a test that measures the central vision. This test would not be helpful in this case, because the patient's central vision is already known to be affected.

The patient has a history of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) in the left eye, which was treated with travoprost ophthalmic solution, 0.004%, and oral acetazolamide and resolved. However, the patient's IOP has now increased again, despite continuing maximum medical therapy for 1 week. The patient also has decreased vision in the left eye, which shows an IOP measured by GAT of 6 mm Hg, visual acuity of 20/400, and a cornea that is edematous. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of acute angle-closure glaucoma.

Acute angle-closure glaucoma is a serious eye condition that can lead to permanent blindness if not treated promptly. The goal of treatment is to lower the IOP as quickly as possible. This can be done with medications, such as acetazolamide or timolol, or with surgery, such as laser iridotomy or trabeculectomy.

In this case, the patient's IOP is still elevated despite being treated with maximum medical therapy. Therefore, the next step in management is to increase the frequency of prednisolone administration to 6 times per day. Prednisolone is a corticosteroid that can help to reduce inflammation and lower the IOP.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option B: Rechecking the IOP with a handheld tonometer off the LASIK flap would not provide any additional information. The IOP is already known to be elevated, and the location of the tonometer would not change the results.
* Option C: Injecting foscarnet sodium intravitreally is not indicated for the treatment of acute angle-closure glaucoma. Foscarnet sodium is an antiviral medication that is used to treat cytomegalovirus retinitis.
* Option D: Reassuring the patient and rechecking the IOP in 1 week is not appropriate management for acute angle-closure glaucoma. This is a serious condition that can lead to permanent blindness if not treated promptly. The patient should be treated immediately with medications or surgery to lower the IOP.

Retinoblastoma is a rare but aggressive cancer of the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. It is the most common intraocular cancer in children, accounting for 3-4% of all childhood cancers. The most common presenting sign is leukocoria, a white reflex in the eye that is visible when the pupil is dilated. Other signs and symptoms may include strabismus (crossed eyes), poor vision, and a red eye.

The treatment of retinoblastoma depends on the stage of the disease at diagnosis. Treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Intra-arterial chemotherapy is a type of chemotherapy that is injected directly into the artery that supplies blood to the eye. This allows for higher doses of chemotherapy to be delivered to the tumor while minimizing the side effects of systemic chemotherapy.

Plaque radiotherapy is a type of radiation therapy that uses a thin sheet of radioactive material to deliver radiation to the tumor. This is a less invasive option than surgery and is often used in children with small tumors.

Oral corticosteroids are a type of medication that is used to reduce inflammation. They are not typically used in the treatment of retinoblastoma, but they may be used to treat side effects of other treatments, such as radiation therapy.

Fine-needle aspiration biopsy is a procedure in which a small needle is used to remove a sample of tissue from the tumor. This is not typically done in the diagnosis or treatment of retinoblastoma, but it may be used to determine the type of tumor or to assess the response to treatment.

In this case, the patient is a 2-year-old boy with a choroidal mass that is suspicious for retinoblastoma. The most appropriate treatment is intra-arterial chemotherapy. This will allow for high doses of chemotherapy to be delivered directly to the tumor while minimizing the side effects of systemic chemotherapy.

Explanation:
The patient has a history of breast cancer and presents with a right-sided proptosis, worsening vision, and tearing. On examination, she has a firm, nontender mass in the right superotemporal orbit. Computed tomography scan of the orbits reveals a 1.9 × 2.3 × 1.8-cm mass of an unclear cause within the anterolateral right orbit, exerting mass effect on the globe. These findings are concerning for a malignancy. The next step in management is to perform an incisional biopsy to obtain a tissue diagnosis. An incisional biopsy is a procedure in which a small piece of tissue is removed from a mass for diagnostic purposes. This is the most appropriate next step in management because it will allow the physician to obtain a definitive diagnosis and begin appropriate treatment. A 6-month follow-up would be inappropriate because the patient has a rapidly progressive mass that is causing visual symptoms. Obtaining additional imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), would also be inappropriate because the diagnosis is already suspected and a tissue diagnosis is needed to guide treatment. An excisional biopsy would be inappropriate because this is a large mass that is likely to require surgery regardless of the biopsy results.

The patient's history and presentation are consistent with myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disorder that causes fluctuating weakness of skeletal muscles, including the muscles that control eye movement. The diagnosis of myasthenia gravis can be confirmed with a blood test to measure the levels of antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor. Treatment typically involves the use of medications that block the action of acetylcholinesterase, an enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that is essential for muscle contraction. Pyridostigmine (Mestinon) is one such medication.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomographic (CT) imaging of the orbits are not necessary in the initial evaluation of a patient with suspected myasthenia gravis. These imaging studies may be helpful in ruling out other causes of ptosis, such as a tumor or a mass lesion, but they are not specific for myasthenia gravis.

Müller muscle conjunctival resection and external levator advancement are surgical procedures that may be used to treat ptosis, but they are not the first-line treatment for myasthenia gravis. These procedures are typically reserved for patients who do not respond to medical therapy.

In conclusion, the patient should undergo a blood test to measure the levels of antibodies against the acetylcholine receptor. If the test is positive, the patient should be started on treatment with pyridostigmine.

Explanation:

The left sympathetic trunk is a bundle of nerve fibers that runs along the left side of the neck and upper chest. It is responsible for controlling sweating, blood pressure, and pupil dilation. When the left sympathetic trunk is compressed or invaded by a tumor, it can cause a condition called hemifacial hyperhidrosis, which is excessive sweating on the left side of the face.

The other options are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms. C7 cervical spinal cord compression would cause symptoms in the arms and legs, not the face. Right cervical ganglion invasion would cause symptoms on the right side of the face, not the left. Transection of the left sympathetic trunk would cause symptoms on both sides of the face.

The patient in this case has a history of hypertension and presented to the emergency department after multiple episodes of palpitations with near syncope. While in the emergency department, she developed monomorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT) with hemodynamic instability and was successfully cardioverted. She continued to have nonsustained monomorphic VT, so intravenous amiodarone and oral metoprolol were initiated. She was admitted for further evaluation. Results of tests of electrolyte levels and coronary angiography were normal. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging with gadolinium contrast revealed normal-sized cardiac chambers and normal biventricular function without delayed enhancement.

The presenting electrocardiogram (ECG) shows a wide complex tachycardia with a rate of 150 beats per minute. The QRS complexes are bizarre and have a left bundle branch block morphology. There is no P wave visible, consistent with ventricular tachycardia.

The patient's clinical presentation and ECG findings are consistent with a diagnosis of idiopathic ventricular tachycardia. This is a type of VT that occurs in patients with no underlying structural heart disease. It is a relatively common arrhythmia, accounting for up to 20% of all cases of VT. Idiopathic VT is usually benign, but it can occasionally be life-threatening.

The treatment of idiopathic VT depends on the patient's clinical presentation and the severity of the arrhythmia. In patients with well-tolerated VT, treatment may be with antiarrhythmic drugs such as amiodarone or sotalol. However, in patients with hemodynamically unstable VT or recurrent VT despite medical therapy, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is often recommended.

An ICD is a small device that is implanted in the chest. It monitors the heart's rhythm and can deliver an electric shock to terminate VT or ventricular fibrillation (VF). ICDs have been shown to be very effective in preventing sudden cardiac death in patients with ventricular arrhythmias.

In this case, the patient has a history of syncope and hemodynamically unstable VT. She has also had recurrent VT despite medical therapy. Therefore, she is at high risk for sudden cardiac death. The best treatment for her is to have an ICD implanted.

The other options are not appropriate for this patient. Oral antiarrhythmic drugs are not effective in preventing sudden cardiac death in patients with idiopathic VT. Discharge with oral β-blocker or nondihydropyridine calcium channel blocker would not be adequate treatment for this patient's arrhythmia.

Therefore, the correct answer is: **A: Placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.**

Explanation:
The most likely diagnosis is a mixed lymphatic and venous malformation (LVM). This is a benign condition that is characterized by the presence of both lymphatic and venous channels. LVMs can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the head and neck region. They are typically diagnosed in childhood or adolescence.

The patient in this case presents with a large, partially obstructing mass in the right oropharynx protruding from the right tonsil. The lesion is without ulceration, exudate, or erythema. The contralateral tonsil is small and normal in appearance. The remainder of her physical examination findings are unremarkable, including no neck masses.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of LVM. LVMs are typically soft, fluctuant masses that are blue or purple in color. They may be present at birth or may develop later in life. LVMs are usually asymptomatic, but they can cause symptoms such as pain, swelling, and bleeding.

The treatment for LVM is surgical excision. This is usually a simple procedure that can be performed under local anesthesia. In some cases, LVMs may recur after surgery. However, most patients have a good prognosis with no long-term complications.

The other possible diagnoses are not as likely in this case. Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that can occur in the tonsils. However, it is typically a slow-growing cancer that does not cause symptoms until it is advanced. Hemangiomas are benign tumors that are made up of blood vessels. They can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the skin. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymph nodes. It is typically a slow-growing cancer that does not cause symptoms until it is advanced.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for the patient in this case is a mixed lymphatic and venous malformation. This is a benign condition that is characterized by the presence of both lymphatic and venous channels. LVMs can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the head and neck region. They are typically diagnosed in childhood or adolescence. The treatment for LVM is surgical excision. This is usually a simple procedure that can be performed under local anesthesia. In some cases, LVMs may recur after surgery. However, most patients have a good prognosis with no long-term complications.

Explanation:

Neuroborreliosis is a systemic illness caused by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi. It is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected Ixodes ticks. The most common manifestations of neuroborreliosis are lymphocytic meningitis, cranial neuritis, and radiculoneuritis.

In this case, the patient presented with a 2-week history of flulike symptoms, followed by right facial nerve paralysis, hearing loss, tinnitus, and otalgia. The patient had no prior otologic history and no history of noise exposure. His otologic and head and neck examination findings were unremarkable. Comprehensive audiometry showed a mild sensorineural hearing loss from 3000 to 8000 Hz in the right ear and a mild sensorineural hearing loss at 8000 Hz only in the left ear. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and internal auditory canals (IACs) with contrast showed abnormal linear and smooth enhancement of the right facial nerve in the superior distal IAC, labyrinthine segment, and geniculate ganglion. Discrete enhancement was also seen within the inferior aspect of the right IAC in the region of the vestibulocochlear nerve.

The clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging findings are consistent with a diagnosis of neuroborreliosis. The patient was treated with a course of intravenous ceftriaxone, and his symptoms resolved.

The other possible diagnoses are not supported by the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging findings. Vestibular schwannoma is a benign tumor that arises from the vestibular nerve. It is the most common type of schwannoma, and it typically presents with unilateral hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo. Idiopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss is a sudden, unexplained loss of hearing that occurs in one ear. It is the most common cause of hearing loss in adults, and it is thought to be caused by a viral infection or an autoimmune reaction. Facial nerve schwannoma is a benign tumor that arises from the facial nerve. It is the most common type of schwannoma to affect the facial nerve, and it typically presents with facial paralysis.

Explanation:
The most likely diagnosis is a macrocystic lymphatic malformation. This is supported by the following findings:

* The mass is located in the sublingual region, which is a common site for lymphatic malformations.
* The mass is multiloculated, which is a characteristic feature of lymphatic malformations.
* The mass is bright on T2-weighted imaging and dark on T1-weighted imaging, which is consistent with the presence of fluid.
* The mass does not enhance with intravenous gadolinium, which is also a characteristic feature of lymphatic malformations.

Cystic teratoma (mature) is less likely than a macrocystic lymphatic malformation. This is because cystic teratomas are typically found in the ovaries or testes, and they are not usually located in the sublingual region. In addition, cystic teratomas are more likely to enhance with intravenous gadolinium than lymphatic malformations.

Foregut duplication cyst is also less likely than a macrocystic lymphatic malformation. This is because foregut duplication cysts are typically found in the gastrointestinal tract, and they are not usually located in the sublingual region. In addition, foregut duplication cysts are more likely to have a fluid-fluid level than lymphatic malformations.

Dermoid cyst is the least likely diagnosis. This is because dermoid cysts are typically found in the skin, and they are not usually located in the sublingual region. In addition, dermoid cysts are more likely to have a fat signal on T1-weighted imaging than lymphatic malformations.

Explanation:
The patient has a positive family history for CF, with a sister and a great aunt with the disease. She also has chronic constipation and poor weight gain, which are common symptoms of CF. However, her newborn genetic screening was normal, and her sweat chloride tests were indeterminate. A 97-mutation CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) analysis panel was negative, and whole-genome sequence analysis revealed 1 CF-causing mutation (c.2249C>T) and 2 likely benign variants (c.1408A>G and c.2562T>G).

The presence of a single CF-causing mutation does not necessarily mean that the patient has CF. In fact, about 2% of the population carries a single CF-causing mutation, but only about 1 in 3,000 people has CF. The patient's symptoms are not specific to CF, and her other test results are not consistent with the diagnosis. Therefore, it is most likely that the patient does not have CF.

Additional genetic testing, alternative CFTR functional testing, or repeat sweat chloride analysis would not be helpful in this case. The patient has already had a negative 97-mutation CFTR analysis panel, and whole-genome sequence analysis is the most sensitive test for CF. Sweat chloride testing is not always reliable, and the patient's previous tests were indeterminate. Therefore, there is no need to do any further testing.

The patient has a history of black ink tattoos, and he has recently developed blurry vision and inflammation of the skin surrounding the tattoos. The skin biopsy showed epithelioid histiocytes with macrophages containing coarse black granular pigment. This is consistent with a diagnosis of tattoo granuloma, which is a chronic inflammatory condition that can occur in response to foreign material in the skin, such as black ink. The most effective treatment for tattoo granuloma is removal of the tattoo.

Topical steroid eyedrop therapy may be helpful in relieving inflammation of the eye, but it will not address the underlying cause of the problem, which is the tattoo. Referencing the patient to rheumatology or performing surgical implantation of glaucoma drainage device is not appropriate at this time, as the patient does not have any signs or symptoms of rheumatological disease or glaucoma.

In summary, the patient has a history of black ink tattoos and has recently developed blurry vision and inflammation of the skin surrounding the tattoos. The skin biopsy showed epithelioid histiocytes with macrophages containing coarse black granular pigment, which is consistent with a diagnosis of tattoo granuloma. The most effective treatment for tattoo granuloma is removal of the tattoo.

The infant in this case has a widespread, papulopustulovesicular rash with oval to elongated, serpiginous or J-shaped burrows. This is the classic presentation of scabies, a parasitic infection caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. The mite burrows into the skin and lays eggs, which cause an allergic reaction in the host. The rash is typically pruritic, and the infant in this case has reported increasing restlessness at night.

The differential diagnosis for scabies includes other papulopustulovesicular rashes, such as impetigo, varicella, and contact dermatitis. However, the history of contact with a babysitter who reported pruritus, especially at night, is highly suggestive of scabies.

The next step in the management of this infant is to perform skin scraping of burrows from multiple sites to confirm the diagnosis. If scabies is confirmed, the infant should be treated with a topical scabicide, such as permethrin cream or lindane lotion. The infant's bedding and clothing should also be washed in hot water and dried on high heat.

A: Administer intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics is incorrect because the infant does not have any signs of bacterial infection.

B: Start a topical steroid is incorrect because steroids can worsen the rash in scabies.

D: Do nothing and reassure the parents is incorrect because scabies is a treatable condition.

Explanation: Pyoderma vegetans is a rare, chronic, and debilitating skin disease characterized by the development of painful, vegetating, and ulcerative lesions on the skin. The disease is most commonly seen in young adults and is associated with a variety of underlying conditions, including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and HIV infection.

The patient in the case presented with a 2-week history of vegetating, bleeding plaques and pustules on his face, scalp, trunk, and extremities. He reported that lesions began as pustules and developed into painful, itchy plaques. He had been treated with prednisolone, clindamycin, and fluconazole, but he continued to develop new lesions. On examination, pustules and hemorrhagic-crusted plaques were seen on the scalp, legs, arms, and trunk along with keloidal plaques on the face. Histopathologic examination of a biopsy specimen taken from the arm demonstrated pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, dermal neutrophilia, and microabscesses with eosinophilia.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of pyoderma vegetans. The patient's history of Crohn's disease and the presence of pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia on histopathologic examination are further supportive of the diagnosis.

Blastomycosis is a fungal infection that can cause skin lesions, but these are typically single and not widespread. Halogenoderma is a skin condition that can be caused by exposure to certain halogens, such as chlorine or bromine. It is characterized by the development of hyperpigmentation, lichenification, and folliculitis.

In conclusion, the patient's presentation is most consistent with a diagnosis of pyoderma vegetans.

Facial morphea is a rare, chronic, and progressive autoimmune disease that affects the skin. It is characterized by the formation of hard, white plaques on the face. The exact cause of facial morphea is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder, in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue.

The most common symptom of facial morphea is the formation of one or more hard, white plaques on the face. The plaques are usually round or oval, and they can be up to several inches in diameter. They may also be raised and have a shiny appearance. In some cases, the plaques may be painful or itchy.

Facial morphea can also cause other symptoms, such as hair loss, numbness, and tingling. In rare cases, it can also affect the eyes, muscles, and bones.

There is no cure for facial morphea, but there are treatments that can help to control the symptoms. Treatment usually involves a combination of medications, such as steroids and calcineurin inhibitors. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the plaques.

The prognosis for facial morphea varies depending on the severity of the disease. In most cases, the plaques will eventually fade on their own, but they may leave behind scars. In some cases, the disease can progress and cause serious problems, such as blindness or nerve damage.

**Explanation:**

The patient in the case presentation presents with a several-year history of persistent round lesions with a scar-like appearance on his face. Before evaluation, his condition had been diagnosed as lupus and lipoatrophy and he tried several treatments with no success. The results of his physical examination showed several round atrophic lesions on his face, symmetric and bilateral, that were located especially on the malar and preauricular areas, with a diameter of 5 to 10 mm. His skin lesions were not indurated and displayed no epidermal changes. The patient denied experiencing previous inflammation. He had no history of chicken pox or acne or traumatic lesions in those areas. New punch biopsy specimens were obtained for further evaluation.

The clinical presentation of the patient is consistent with facial morphea. Facial morphea is a rare, chronic, and progressive autoimmune disease that affects the skin.

The prognosis for facial morphea varies depending on the severity of the disease. In most cases, the plaques will eventually fade on their own, but they may leave behind scars. In some cases, the disease can progress and cause serious problems, such as blindness or nerve damage.

The other options are incorrect because they do not fit the clinical presentation of the patient. Primary anetoderma is a rare, acquired skin disorder characterized by the development of one or more small, atrophic patches on the face or trunk. Atrophoderma vermiculata is a rare, acquired skin disorder characterized by the development of multiple, small, atrophic, verrucous papules on the extremities. Atrophia maculosa varioliformis cutis is a rare, acquired skin disorder characterized by the development of multiple, small, atrophic macules on the face, trunk, and extremities. Facial morphea is a more likely diagnosis than any of these other options.

The patient is a 60-year-old man with a history of IgA kappa multiple myeloma. He had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma 2 years earlier after discovery of osteolytic bone lesions of the skull and the findings of a bone marrow biopsy. The patient had been treated with bortezomib and dexamethasone followed by autologous blood progenitor cell transplantation, which resulted in complete response. At the time of the consultation, he was free of disease.

The patient was referred for evaluation of an indolent, erythematous papule on his glans penis of 2 weeks’ duration. He denied sexual risk behavior and reported no recent changes in medication. Careful physical examination revealed a shiny, tense, erythematous, hemispherical papule measuring 5 mm in diameter located on the lateral aspect of the glans (Figure 1A). There were no other skin lesions. The lymph nodes were not palpable, and there was no organomegaly. A punch biopsy was performed for histopathological evaluation (Figure 1B and C).

A, Shiny, erythematous, hemispherical papule on the lateral aspect of the glans penis. B and C, Hematoxylin-eosin stain was performed for evaluation.

The histopathological examination showed a dense infiltrate of amyloid in the dermis and subcutis. The amyloid was Congo red-positive and showed apple-green birefringence under polarized light. There was no evidence of malignancy.

The patient was diagnosed with primary nodular amyloidosis of the glans penis. He was treated with colchicine, which resulted in a resolution of the papule.

Primary nodular amyloidosis of the glans penis is a rare condition that is characterized by the deposition of amyloid in the dermis and subcutis of the glans penis. The amyloid is composed of immunoglobulin light chains, and the condition is most commonly associated with multiple myeloma. The diagnosis is made by biopsy, and the treatment is with colchicine. The prognosis is good, with most patients experiencing a complete resolution of the lesions.

The other options are incorrect because they are not consistent with the patient's history, physical examination, and histopathological findings.

* Primary penile B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a rare malignancy that is characterized by the proliferation of B lymphocytes in the penis. The patient does not have any lymphadenopathy, and there is no evidence of malignancy on histopathological examination.
* Kaposi sarcoma of the penis is a rare malignancy that is characterized by the proliferation of spindle cells in the penis. The patient does not have any risk factors for Kaposi sarcoma, and there is no evidence of malignancy on histopathological examination.
* Plasmacytoma is a rare malignancy that is characterized by the proliferation of plasma cells in the bone marrow. The patient does not have any bone lesions on histopathological examination.

Therefore, the correct answer is: **D. Primary nodular amyloidosis of the glans penis.**

A sliding hernia is a type of inguinal hernia that occurs when a portion of the bladder, bowel, or omentum slides through a weakened area in the abdominal wall. A Saphena varix is a varicose vein that occurs in the saphenous vein, which is the main vein that runs along the back of the thigh. A communicating hydrocele is a type of hydrocele that occurs when there is a communication between the scrotum and the abdominal cavity.

In this case, the patient has a history of Childs B cirrhosis, which is a condition that causes the liver to become inflamed and scarred. This can lead to a number of complications, including portal hypertension, which is a condition in which the pressure in the portal vein (the vein that carries blood from the intestines to the liver) is increased. Portal hypertension can lead to a number of complications, including ascites (fluid buildup in the abdomen), esophageal varices (varicose veins in the esophagus), and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (infection of the abdominal cavity).

In this case, the patient also has a right groin mass that extends into the scrotum. This is a common finding in patients with amyand hernia, which is a type of inguinal hernia that occurs when the appendix is included within the hernia sac. The appendix is a small, finger-shaped organ that projects from the cecum, which is the first part of the large intestine.

The patient's leukocytosis, creatinine level, and urinalysis results are all consistent with a urinary tract infection. The patient's renography results show a 34% reduction of right renal function, which is a sign of obstruction of the right ureter. The obstruction is likely caused by the amyand hernia, which is compressing the ureter.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is amyand hernia.

Explanation:
Ileo-colic intussusception is a condition in which a segment of the small intestine telescopes into the next segment. This can cause blockage of the small intestine and lead to abdominal pain, vomiting, and fever. The diagnosis of ileo-colic intussusception is often made with abdominal imaging, such as a CT scan. Treatment usually involves surgery to remove the intussusception.

In this case, the patient is a healthy 29-year-old pregnant woman with 34 weeks’ gestational age. She presents with diffused acute abdominal pain and vomiting. The pain is located in the periumbilical region and intensified within a few hours. The patient felt normal fetal movements during this time. An initial surgical evaluation was done, and the cause for the abdominal pain was assumed to be not of surgical condition. Next, the patient was evaluated by an obstetrician-gynecologist, and although the gynecologic examination, ultrasonography, and monitoring were all normal, the patient was admitted for further supervision in the obstetrics department. The next day, when the abdominal pain and vomiting persisted and an elevated leukocyte blood count of 14 200/mL was noted (to convert to ×109 per liter, multiply by 0.001), a second surgical consultation was done. The physical examination was significant for diffuse abdominal tenderness. Although the patient was pregnant, and owing to nonavailability of magnetic resonance imaging at that time, a contrast-enhanced abdominopelvic computed tomography was performed (Figure 1).

The CT scan showed an edematous small intestinal loop on the left abdomen, with uterus and head of fetus in the pelvis. This finding is consistent with ileo-colic intussusception.

The other possible diagnoses are Crohn ileitis, foreign body ingestion, and adenocarcinoma of small intestine. Crohn ileitis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the small intestine. It can cause abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. Foreign body ingestion can cause blockage of the small intestine and lead to abdominal pain, vomiting, and fever. Adenocarcinoma of small intestine is a rare type of cancer that can cause abdominal pain, weight loss, and anemia.

In this case, the patient's symptoms and the CT scan findings are most consistent with ileo-colic intussusception.

The patient's presentation is consistent with CMV retinitis, a common complication of immunosuppressive therapy in organ transplant recipients. The diagnosis is confirmed by fundus examination, which shows characteristic white retinal lesions with hemorrhages and exudates. Treatment is with intravenous ganciclovir, which is given for a minimum of 2 weeks. In some cases, intravitreal ganciclovir injections may also be necessary.

* Brain neuroimaging and lumbar puncture are not necessary in the setting of CMV retinitis. These tests would be more likely to be indicated if there was a suspicion of a central nervous system infection.
* Administering systemic steroid treatment is not recommended for CMV retinitis. Steroids can worsen the infection and increase the risk of complications.
* Administering intravitreal injection of antifungal agents is not appropriate for CMV retinitis. Antifungal agents are used to treat fungal infections, not viral infections.

The patient has a history of breast cancer and has developed a choroidal infiltrate of unknown cause. She has also developed a right bundle branch block and complete heart block, which are both suggestive of cardiac sarcoidosis. Cardiac sarcoidosis is a rare disease that can affect the heart muscle, the heart valves, and the conduction system of the heart. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including chest pain, shortness of breath, heart palpitations, and arrhythmias. There is no cure for cardiac sarcoidosis, but treatment can help to control the symptoms and prevent complications.

In this case, the patient's choroidal infiltrate is most likely due to cardiac sarcoidosis. The patient should be referred to a cardiologist for further evaluation and treatment. A cardiac biopsy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis and to determine the extent of the disease. Treatment for cardiac sarcoidosis may include corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs, and/or heart transplantation.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Chorioretinal biopsy is not necessary in this case because the diagnosis of cardiac sarcoidosis is likely based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory tests.
* Option B: Observation is not an appropriate treatment for cardiac sarcoidosis because the disease can cause serious complications, such as heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death.
* Option D: Oral corticosteroid therapy is not a definitive treatment for cardiac sarcoidosis. Corticosteroid therapy may be used to control the symptoms of cardiac sarcoidosis, but it does not cure the disease.

Explanation:

The patient has bilateral proptosis, increased resistance to retropulsion, and very limited extraocular motility in all directions of gaze. These findings are concerning for an orbital mass, which could be a tumor, infection, or inflammation. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the orbits is the best test to evaluate for an orbital mass. It can help to determine the size, location, and nature of the mass. This information is important for planning the next steps in the patient's care.

An orbital biopsy is not necessary at this time, as the CT scan will provide more information about the mass. A consultation from the retina service is also not necessary, as the patient's vision is not acutely threatened. Emergency canthotomy and cantholysis to decompress the orbits is a surgical procedure that is used to relieve pressure in the orbits. It is only indicated in cases of acute orbital compartment syndrome, which is a life-threatening condition. The patient does not have any signs or symptoms of orbital compartment syndrome, so this procedure is not necessary.

Explanation:

The patient presented with bilateral sequential acute proptosis in the setting of a mildly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, antinuclear antibody titer, and positive results for anti-Ro and anti-La antibodies. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of giant cell arteritis (GCA), which is a systemic vasculitis that can involve the orbit. The initial treatment of GCA is with high-dose corticosteroids, which can help to reduce inflammation and prevent vision loss.

Orbitotomy with biopsy is not indicated in the initial management of GCA, as it is not necessary to make a definitive diagnosis. External beam radiotherapy is not a first-line treatment for GCA, as it is not as effective as corticosteroids in reducing inflammation. Intravenous antibiotic therapy is not indicated in the management of GCA, as it is not an infectious process.

The patient has a history of well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension. She also has a history of breast cancer previously treated with tamoxifen. She presented with blurry vision in the right eye of 2 weeks' duration. The dilated fundus examination results were notable for mild cataracts in both eyes and fine superficial retinal hemorrhages surrounded by a cluster of exudates in the right retina. An examination of the left retina produced unremarkable results.

The most likely diagnosis is diabetic macular edema. Diabetic macular edema is a complication of diabetes that can cause blurred vision, distortion, or loss of central vision. It occurs when fluid builds up in the macula, the part of the retina responsible for sharp, central vision.

The treatment for diabetic macular edema depends on the severity of the edema. In mild cases, laser treatment or anti-VEGF injections may be recommended. In more severe cases, surgery may be necessary.

In this case, the patient's blood glucose control is well-managed. However, she does have a history of hypertension. Hypertension can also contribute to the development of diabetic macular edema. Therefore, it is important to continue to manage the patient's blood pressure to prevent further damage to the retina.

If the macular edema does not improve with continued blood glucose control, then intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injection or focal laser treatment may be recommended. Anti-VEGF injections work by blocking the growth of new blood vessels in the retina. This can help to reduce the amount of fluid in the macula and improve vision. Focal laser treatment works by destroying small areas of the retina that are leaking fluid. This can also help to reduce the amount of fluid in the macula and improve vision.

Recommendation A is incorrect because intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injection is not the first-line treatment for diabetic macular edema. In mild cases, laser treatment or anti-VEGF injections may be recommended. In more severe cases, surgery may be necessary.

Recommendation C is incorrect because the patient's changes are not medication-associated. The patient has a history of diabetes and hypertension, which are risk factors for diabetic macular edema.

Recommendation D is incorrect because the patient's blood pressure is well-controlled. However, it is important to continue to manage the patient's blood pressure to prevent further damage to the retina.

Explanation: The patient's symptoms are concerning for a cavernous sinus thrombosis, which is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition. Cavernous sinus thrombosis is a complication of infection in the face or sinuses, and it can cause a variety of symptoms, including eye swelling, redness, and pain; double vision; headache; and facial numbness or weakness.

The most important diagnostic test for cavernous sinus thrombosis is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain and orbits. An MRI scan can show the presence of a thrombus (blood clot) in the cavernous sinus, as well as any other abnormalities that may be causing the patient's symptoms.

If a cavernous sinus thrombosis is diagnosed, the patient will need to be treated with antibiotics and steroids. In some cases, surgery may also be necessary to remove the thrombus or to drain an abscess.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they would not be appropriate for the patient's presentation. Reassurance and artificial tears would not be appropriate because the patient's symptoms are concerning for a serious medical condition. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head would not be as sensitive as an MRI scan for detecting a cavernous sinus thrombosis. Urgent referral to neurosurgery would be appropriate if the patient's symptoms were rapidly progressive or if there were signs of increased intracranial pressure, but this is not the case in this patient.

Explanation:
The patient presented with worsening blurry vision and floaters in the left eye for 3 weeks in the setting of sinus congestion and left-sided jaw pain for 6 months. He denied flashing lights, visual field defects, trauma, pain, redness, discharge, or other systemic symptoms.

On examination, the patient’s uncorrected visual acuity was 20/20 OD and 20/50 OS (no improvement on refraction), his pupils were equally round and reactive with no relative afferent pupillary defect, his intraocular pressures were normal, and extraocular motility and confrontational visual fields were full. Results from slitlamp and dilated fundus examinations of the right eye were normal. Anterior segment examination of the left eye showed mild fine keratic precipitates and pigmented cell; dilated fundus examination showed significant vitritis but no obvious vascular sheathing or chorioretinal lesions (Figure 1A). Optical coherence tomography of the macula confirmed there was no intraretinal or subretinal fluid (Figure 1B), and fluorescein angiography did not show any vascular leakage or areas of nonperfusion. Results of further workup showed normal complete blood cell count and comprehensive metabolic panel laboratory testing, undetectable HIV viral load, and unremarkable chest radiography; laboratory results for tuberculosis (T-SPOT.TB testing), syphilis (rapid plasma reagin with reflex treponemal testing), cytoplasmic and perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and blood cultures were all negative as well.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes infectious causes such as viral retinitis, tuberculosis, syphilis, and fungal endophthalmitis; non-infectious causes such as sarcoidosis, idiopathic uveitis, and posterior scleritis; and neoplasms such as metastatic carcinoma and lymphoma.

Given the patient's history of sinus congestion and left-sided jaw pain, a head/maxillofacial computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the next best step in the evaluation. This will help to rule out any underlying infectious or neoplastic process.

If the imaging studies are negative, then the patient could be started on a course of topical or systemic steroids. However, this would not be the first-line treatment in this case, as there is no evidence of active inflammation.

Vitrectomy is not indicated at this time, as there is no evidence of vitreous hemorrhage or retinal detachment.

Therefore, the next best step in the evaluation of this patient is to perform a head/maxillofacial computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging.

Explanation: The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with secondary syphilis. He had a previous episode of syphilis, which was treated with penicillin. He is now HIV-positive and is receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy. He has developed multiple ulcers on his buccal mucosa, as well as a nonpainful shallow penile ulcer. He also has pruritic, mildly painful, hyperpigmented papules and plaques on the bilateral soles of his feet in a pattern identical to previous syphilitic eruption. The biopsy specimen shows lymphocytes, eosinophils, and plasma cells within the infiltrate, which is consistent with secondary syphilis.

Lichen planus is a chronic, autoimmune skin disease characterized by flat-topped, purple papules and plaques. It is not associated with HIV infection or syphilis. Lichenoid drug reaction is a type of allergic reaction to a medication that can cause a rash similar to lichen planus. It is not associated with HIV infection or syphilis.

A transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) is a type of ultrasound that uses a probe inserted into the esophagus to view the heart and blood vessels in the chest. It is a more sensitive and accurate test than a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) for detecting heart defects, including those that may be associated with brain abscesses. In this case, the patient has a history of atrial septal defect (ASD) and ventricular septal defect (VSD) repair, which are congenital heart defects that can increase the risk of developing brain abscesses. A TEE is the best test to evaluate the heart for these defects and to look for any other abnormalities that may be contributing to the patient's brain abscess.

B: Computed tomographic imaging of the chest (CT scan) is a useful test for evaluating the lungs and other organs in the chest, but it is not as sensitive as a TEE for detecting heart defects. C: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a very sensitive test for evaluating the heart, but it is not as widely available as a TEE. D: Transthoracic echocardiogram with a bubble study is a test that can be used to detect heart defects, but it is not as sensitive or accurate as a TEE.

Explanation:

The patient is a man in his 50s with a history of chronic hepatitis C, hypothyroidism, and alcoholism. These risk factors increase the risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma.

The patient presented with nasal congestion and epistaxis. These are common symptoms of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

The nonenhanced computed tomography (CT) scan showed a soft-tissue mass extending from the nasopharynx into the left sphenoid sinus with erosion of the sphenoid sinus floor and the clivus. This is consistent with a nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study showed a lobulated mass centered to the nasopharynx, measuring about 2.8 × 2.6 × 4.5 cm in maximal diameters. The mass demonstrated intermediate T2 hyperintense signal and avid postcontrast enhancement. It extended inferiorly down to the oropharynx and superiorly along the floor of the left sphenoid sinus with extension into the sinus itself; posteriorly, there were erosions involving the sphenoid bone and the clivus. This is also consistent with a nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

The patient underwent a total mass resection via endoscopic anterior cranial base approach, with extradural tumor resection, reconstruction of the skull base, and a nasoseptal flap. This is the standard treatment for nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

The patient's prognosis is good. With early diagnosis and treatment, the five-year survival rate for nasopharyngeal carcinoma is over 90%.

The other options are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation and imaging findings.

* Option B: Lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymph nodes. It is not typically associated with nasal congestion and epistaxis.
* Option C: Ectopic pituitary adenoma is a rare type of pituitary tumor that occurs outside the pituitary gland. It is not typically associated with erosion of the skull base.

Explanation:

A jugulotympanic paraganglioma is a rare, benign tumor that arises from the paraganglia, which are small clusters of cells that are located throughout the body. They are most commonly found in the head and neck, and they can occur in the middle ear, jugular foramen, or carotid body.

Jugulotympanic paragangliomas are typically slow-growing tumors that do not metastasize. However, they can cause symptoms such as hearing loss, tinnitus, facial paralysis, and dizziness.

The diagnosis of a jugulotympanic paraganglioma is made based on the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging studies such as CT scan or MRI. Treatment typically involves surgical removal of the tumor.

The other options are incorrect because they are not typically associated with middle ear masses.

* Facial nerve venous malformation is a rare, benign condition that occurs when there is a connection between the facial nerve and a vein. It can cause symptoms such as facial paralysis, numbness, and pain.

Explanation:

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is a dermoid cyst (mature teratoma). This is supported by the following findings:

* The mass is located in the anterior nasal cavity, which is a common site for dermoid cysts.
* The mass is firm and pedunculated, which are also features of dermoid cysts.
* The mass is hyperintense on T1-weighted MRI, suggesting a fatty component. This is a characteristic finding of dermoid cysts.
* The mass does not have an intracranial tract, which is helpful in ruling out other possible diagnoses, such as encephalocele.

Hairy polyps are typically located in the nasopharynx and are not associated with nasal obstruction. Gliomas are rare in children and are typically located in the brain. Encephaloceles are protrusions of brain tissue through a defect in the skull and are not associated with a fatty component on MRI.

In summary, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is a dermoid cyst (mature teratoma). This is supported by the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging findings.

Xeroderma pigmentosum is a rare, genetic disorder that causes extreme sensitivity to sunlight. People with xeroderma pigmentosum are at high risk of developing skin cancer, including basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and melanoma. The disorder is caused by mutations in genes that are involved in DNA repair. These mutations make it difficult for the body to repair damage caused by ultraviolet radiation from sunlight. As a result, people with xeroderma pigmentosum accumulate genetic damage in their skin cells, which can lead to the development of cancer.

The symptoms of xeroderma pigmentosum typically appear in early childhood. Children with the disorder may develop freckles, sunspots, and dry, scaly skin on sun-exposed areas of the body. They may also develop red, irritated eyes and a sensitivity to light. As they get older, they are at increased risk of developing skin cancer.

There is no cure for xeroderma pigmentosum, but there are treatments that can help to manage the symptoms and reduce the risk of skin cancer. People with the disorder should avoid exposure to sunlight, and they should wear sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher whenever they are outside. They should also see a dermatologist regularly for skin exams.

A, Trichothiodystrophy, is a rare, genetic disorder that affects the hair, nails, and skin. It is characterized by brittle, dry hair, fragile nails, and a scaly skin rash. Trichothiodystrophy is not associated with an increased risk of skin cancer.

B, Cockayne syndrome, is a rare, genetic disorder that causes developmental delay, short stature, and sensitivity to sunlight. People with Cockayne syndrome are at increased risk of developing skin cancer, but the disorder is not typically associated with the severe facial disfigurement that is seen in the case described in the question.

D, Actinic keratosis, is a precancerous skin lesion that is caused by exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Actinic keratosis typically appears as a rough, scaly patch on the skin. It is not typically associated with the severe facial disfigurement that is seen in the case described in the question.

Explanation:
The patient's clinical presentation, imaging findings, and elevated VEGF-D level are consistent with a diagnosis of pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis (PLCH). PLCH is a rare, non-neoplastic, granulomatous disorder of the lungs that affects primarily young adults. It is characterized by the accumulation of Langerhans cells, a type of white blood cell, in the lungs. The most common symptoms of PLCH are shortness of breath, cough, and fatigue. Imaging studies, such as a high-resolution CT scan of the chest, can show characteristic findings of PLCH, such as diffuse thin-walled pulmonary cysts. Elevated levels of VEGF-D are a sensitive and specific marker for PLCH. A lung biopsy is usually not necessary to establish the diagnosis of PLCH, but it may be performed to rule out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms. Treatment for PLCH is generally not necessary for patients with mild disease. However, patients with more severe disease may require treatment with corticosteroids, chemotherapy, or targeted therapy.

The other options are incorrect because:
* Option A is incorrect because the VEGF-D level is not nonspecific. It is a sensitive and specific marker for PLCH.
* Option C is incorrect because the VEGF-D level is not supportive of a diagnosis of lymphangioleiomyomatosis. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis is a rare, progressive, and fatal disease of the lungs that affects primarily young women. It is characterized by the accumulation of smooth muscle cells in the lungs, which can lead to the formation of cysts and respiratory failure. The most common symptoms of lymphangioleiomyomatosis are shortness of breath, cough, and fatigue. Imaging studies, such as a high-resolution CT scan of the chest, can show characteristic findings of lymphangioleiomyomatosis, such as diffuse thin-walled pulmonary cysts. However, the VEGF-D level is not a sensitive or specific marker for lymphangioleiomyomatosis.
* Option D is incorrect because the VEGF-D level does not indicate that the patient should undergo folliculin gene test for Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome. Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome is a rare, autosomal dominant disorder characterized by multiple benign tumors of the skin, kidney, and lungs. The most common symptoms of Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome are skin lesions, kidney stones, and respiratory problems. Imaging studies, such as a high-resolution CT scan of the chest, can show characteristic findings of Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome, such as diffuse thin-walled pulmonary cysts. However, the VEGF-D level is not a sensitive or specific marker for Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome.

The patient has a malar rash and polyarthritis, which are characteristic of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE is an autoimmune disease that can affect many parts of the body, including the skin, joints, kidneys, and heart. Anticyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibodies are found in the blood of most people with SLE. Testing for CCP antibodies is a sensitive and specific test for SLE.

The other answers are incorrect because they are not specific tests for SLE. Anti–double-stranded DNA and anti-Smith antibodies are found in the blood of some people with SLE, but they are also found in the blood of people with other autoimmune diseases. Hand radiographs can show changes in the joints that are caused by SLE, but they cannot be used to diagnose SLE. Serologic testing for parvovirus can be used to diagnose parvovirus infection, which can cause a rash and joint pain. However, the patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with parvovirus infection.

Therefore, the correct answer is D: Order testing for anticyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibody.

Test results indicate presence of IgG4-related disease.

IgG4-related disease is a systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by the infiltration of IgG4-positive plasma cells and other inflammatory cells into various organs and tissues. It can affect multiple organs, including the pancreas, liver, kidney, lung, and skin.

The patient in this case has several features that are consistent with IgG4-related disease, including:

* Unintentional weight loss
* Increasing fasting blood glucose values
* Diffuse enlargement of the pancreas with peripheral hypoenhancement but no discrete mass
* Soft tissue surrounding the infrarenal abdominal aorta, extended along the common iliac arteries, and obstructed the left ureter, causing hydronephrosis
* Elevated serum IgG4 levels
* Normal colonoscopy results 8 months ago

Fine-needle aspiration of the pancreas showed no malignancy, which makes pancreatic cancer unlikely. Carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 is a tumor marker that is often elevated in patients with pancreatic cancer, but it can also be elevated in patients with other conditions, such as pancreatitis. The patient in this case is a CA 19-9 nonsecretor, which means that his CA 19-9 levels are not likely to be elevated even if he has pancreatic cancer.

In summary, the patient in this case has several features that are consistent with IgG4-related disease, including unintentional weight loss, increasing fasting blood glucose values, diffuse enlargement of the pancreas with peripheral hypoenhancement but no discrete mass, soft tissue surrounding the infrarenal abdominal aorta, extended along the common iliac arteries, and obstructed the left ureter, causing hydronephrosis, elevated serum IgG4 levels, and normal colonoscopy results 8 months ago. Fine-needle aspiration of the pancreas showed no malignancy, and the patient is a CA 19-9 nonsecretor. These findings are most consistent with the diagnosis of IgG4-related disease.

The other options are incorrect because they do not explain all of the patient's symptoms. Option B, locally invasive pancreatic lymphoma, is unlikely because the patient has no history of lymphoma and his colonoscopy results were normal 8 months ago. Option C, viral hepatitis, is unlikely because the patient does not have any risk factors for viral hepatitis and his liver function tests are normal. Option D, pancreatic cancer but the patient is a carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 nonsecretor, is unlikely because the patient has no history of pancreatic cancer and his fine-needle aspiration of the pancreas showed no malignancy.

Explanation:
Mucormycosis is a rare, but potentially life-threatening fungal infection that can occur in people with weakened immune systems. It is caused by fungi in the Mucorales family, which are found in soil, decaying organic matter, and the environment. Mucormycosis can affect any part of the body, but it is most commonly seen in the lungs, sinuses, brain, and skin.

The patient in this case has a number of risk factors for mucormycosis, including leukemia, pancytopenia, and recurrent neutropenic fevers. These conditions can weaken the immune system and make it more difficult to fight off infection. The patient also has poor oral hygiene, which can provide a portal of entry for the fungus.

The clinical features of mucormycosis can vary depending on the site of infection. In the case of the patient in this case, the infection involved the left hard palate. The patient presented with rapidly growing, severely painful oral lesions that were 2 months’ duration. The lesions were indurated, with central necrosis and desquamation. The patient was also febrile.

The diagnosis of mucormycosis is based on clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The gold standard for diagnosis is biopsy of the affected tissue, which shows characteristic fungal hyphae. Laboratory tests may reveal elevated levels of white blood cells, including neutrophils. Imaging studies, such as computed tomography (CT) scans, can show the extent of the infection.

The treatment of mucormycosis is challenging and often requires a combination of antifungal medications, surgery, and supportive care. The prognosis for patients with mucormycosis is poor, with mortality rates ranging from 30% to 90%.

The other options are incorrect because they are not as likely to occur in a patient with the patient's history and clinical presentation. Squamous cell carcinoma is a common type of cancer that can occur in the mouth, but it is not typically associated with leukemia or pancytopenia. Aspergillosis is a fungal infection that can occur in people with weakened immune systems, but it is not typically seen in the hard palate. Myeloid sarcoma is a rare type of cancer that can occur in the bone marrow, but it is not typically associated with oral lesions.

Explanation:

The patient is a child with multiple, asymptomatic, scattered white macules on the lower abdomen and pubic area, which were present at birth and had gradually increased in size and number. Physical examination revealed multiple, well-demarcated, hypopigmented 1- to 5-mm macules on the lower abdomen and pubic area. There was no history of any systemic disorder and no family history of similar lesions. Direct microscopic examination of scales soaked in potassium hydroxide did not reveal hyphae. Wood light examination revealed no accentuation. A punch biopsy specimen was obtained for further evaluation.

The histopathological examination revealed mild hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and scattered clear cells in the epidermis. The clear cells are larger than the neighboring keratinocytes and contain abundant pale cytoplasm.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of clear cell papulosis. Clear cell papulosis is a rare, benign skin condition characterized by the appearance of multiple, small, white papules on the face, neck, and trunk. The cause of clear cell papulosis is unknown, but it is thought to be a disorder of keratinocyte differentiation. The condition is usually self-limited, but it may persist for several years. There is no specific treatment for clear cell papulosis, but topical corticosteroids may be helpful in reducing the size and number of papules.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Tinea versicolor is a fungal infection of the skin that causes the appearance of multiple, scaly, hypopigmented patches. The lesions of tinea versicolor are usually found on the trunk, arms, and legs. Direct microscopic examination of scales soaked in potassium hydroxide reveals hyphae. Wood light examination reveals a characteristic green fluorescence.
* Vitiligo is an autoimmune disorder that causes the loss of melanocytes, the cells that produce melanin. The lesions of vitiligo are usually found on the face, hands, and feet. Vitiligo is not contagious and there is no cure. Treatment options include topical corticosteroids, phototherapy, and skin grafts.
* Idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis is a common skin condition characterized by the appearance of multiple, small, white macules. The cause of idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis is unknown, but it is thought to be a disorder of melanocyte function. The condition is usually self-limited, but it may persist for several years. There is no specific treatment for idiopathic guttate hypomelanosis. Topical corticosteroids may be helpful in reducing the size and number of macules.

The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type. This is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that typically affects the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. Patients with this disease often present with a history of a persistent nasal mass that is unresponsive to antibiotic therapy. They may also have systemic symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and fatigue.

The histopathologic features of extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type are characteristic. The tumor cells are large, pleomorphic, and have a high mitotic rate. They are positive for markers of natural killer cells, such as CD56 and CD30.

The treatment of extranodal natural killer/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type is typically with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The prognosis for patients with this disease is generally poor, with a median survival of only 2-3 years.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Lymphomatoid granulomatosis is a rare disease that is characterized by the presence of necrotizing granulomas in the lung, skin, and other organs. It is not typically associated with a nasal mass.
* Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener granulomatosis) is a systemic vasculitis that can affect the lungs, kidneys, and other organs. It is not typically associated with a nasal mass.
* Histoplasmosis is a fungal infection that can affect the lungs, skin, and other organs. It is not typically associated with a nasal mass.

The patient's history of prostate cancer treated with robotic prostatectomy 2 years ago, his current presentation with 1 year of progressively worsening postprandial nausea or vomiting, epigastric abdominal pain, anorexia, and weight loss of 27 kg, and his positive QuantiFERON-TB Gold test are all consistent with a diagnosis of abdominal tuberculosis. The abdominal computed tomography scan findings of markedly dilated stomach and duodenum with decompressed, thickened distal small bowel without a clear transition point are also consistent with abdominal tuberculosis.

Sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis is a rare, chronic, fibrosing disease of the peritoneum that is characterized by the formation of thick, fibrous bands that encase the abdominal organs. It is typically seen in patients with a history of abdominal surgery or inflammatory bowel disease. The patient's history does not suggest a diagnosis of sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis.

Adhesive small bowel obstruction is a blockage of the small bowel caused by adhesions, which are bands of scar tissue that form after surgery or inflammation. The patient's history and presentation are consistent with a diagnosis of adhesive small bowel obstruction, but the abdominal computed tomography scan findings are not consistent with this diagnosis.

Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen and pelvis shows an enlarged aortic graft with a soft tissue mass adjacent to the graft. There is also evidence of duodenal inflammation and ulceration.

The most likely diagnosis is an infected aortic graft with aortoduodenal fistula. This is a serious complication of aortic graft surgery that can be fatal if not treated promptly. The infection can spread from the graft to the duodenum, causing ulceration and perforation. This can lead to peritonitis and sepsis.

The patient should be treated with antibiotics and surgery to remove the infected graft and repair the duodenal fistula. The prognosis depends on the extent of the infection and the patient's overall health.

The other possible diagnoses are not as likely in this patient. Carcinoma in the body of the pancreas is a common cancer in older men. However, it is unlikely that this patient would present with a 3-month history of weight loss, anorexia, and back pain. Advanced carcinoma of the duodenum is also a possibility, but it is less likely than an infected aortic graft with aortoduodenal fistula. Posterior perforation of a duodenal ulcer is a rare complication of duodenal ulcers. It is unlikely that this patient would have a posterior perforation of a duodenal ulcer without a history of abdominal pain.

Explanation:
The patient has bilateral choroidal lesions with overlying subretinal fluid, subretinal hemorrhage, and exudates in the left eye. The lesions are hyperechoic on B-scan ultrasonography, consistent with calcification. This is most likely a case of sclerochoroidal calcifications, a rare complication of hyperparathyroidism. The next step in management is to check the parathyroid hormone, vitamin D, and calcium levels to confirm the diagnosis. If the levels are elevated, then treatment with parathyroidectomy or medical therapy to lower the parathyroid hormone levels is indicated. Transvitreous biopsy, oral corticosteroid therapy, and plaque brachytherapy are not indicated for this condition.

The patient has a history of hypothyroidism and meningioma of the cervical spine. Both of these conditions can increase the risk of developing nonarteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION). NAION is a condition that occurs when the optic nerve is deprived of oxygen, resulting in sudden vision loss in one or both eyes. The most common risk factors for NAION are age, hypertension, and smoking. Other risk factors include diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and cardiovascular disease.

The patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with NAION. The dense bilateral cecocentral scotomata are characteristic of NAION. The temporal optic disc pallor in the right eye is also consistent with NAION.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to ask about antihypertensives taken in the evening, sleep apnea, and cardiovascular risk factors. Antihypertensives taken in the evening can increase the risk of NAION by causing nocturnal hypotension. Sleep apnea can also increase the risk of NAION by causing hypoxia. Cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, smoking, and diabetes, can also increase the risk of NAION.

If the patient has any of these risk factors, further testing may be necessary, such as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain to rule out other causes of vision loss, such as a stroke or tumor. The patient may also need to be treated for the underlying condition that is causing the NAION.

A: Analyze the thickness of retinal layers by SD-OCT segmentation is not the next step in the evaluation of this patient because the patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with NAION. SD-OCT segmentation is a useful test for evaluating the thickness of retinal layers in patients with other conditions, such as age-related macular degeneration. However, it is not necessary in patients with NAION.

C: Order mitochondrial genetic testing is not the next step in the evaluation of this patient because the patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with NAION. Mitochondrial genetic testing is a useful test for evaluating patients with suspected mitochondrial diseases. However, it is not necessary in patients with NAION.

D: Ask about toxic agents and nutritional deficiencies is not the next step in the evaluation of this patient because the patient's symptoms and examination findings are consistent with NAION. Toxic agents and nutritional deficiencies can cause optic neuropathy, but they are not common causes of NAION. Therefore, it is not necessary to ask about these factors in patients with NAION.

The patient's presentation is consistent with a number of endocrine disorders, including growth hormone deficiency, hypopituitarism, and diabetes insipidus. These disorders can all cause optic atrophy, as well as other symptoms such as short stature, alopecia, and hypotonia.

A hormone profile will help to determine if the patient has any of these disorders. If the patient does have an endocrine disorder, a consultation with an endocrinologist will be necessary to determine the best course of treatment.

MRI of the brain is not necessary in this case, as the patient's presentation is not consistent with a brain tumor or other structural abnormality. A peripheral blood smear examination is also not necessary, as this would not provide any information about the patient's endocrine status.

Targeted genetic testing may be considered in the future, if the patient's diagnosis is not clear after further testing. However, it is not necessary at this stage.

In conclusion, the best course of action for this patient is to order a hormone profile and consult endocrinology.

 41%|████      | 624/1525 [2:23:53<3:06:32, 12.42s/it]The correct answer is: **A: Perform genetic testing.**

The patient presents with a history of night blindness, ring scotoma, and a nonrecordable electroretinogram. These findings are consistent with retinitis pigmentosa, a genetic disorder that causes progressive degeneration of the photoreceptor cells in the retina. Genetic testing is the most accurate way to diagnose retinitis pigmentosa.

Antiretinal antibodies may be present in patients with retinitis pigmentosa, but they are not specific for this disorder. Systemic evaluation for malignancy is not necessary in the absence of other signs or symptoms of malignancy. Reviewing medications is a reasonable step, but it is unlikely to be the most helpful next step in this case.

Here is a more detailed explanation of the rationale for each answer choice:

* **A: Perform genetic testing.** Genetic testing is the most accurate way to diagnose retinitis pigmentosa. The patient presents with a history of night blindness, ring scotoma, and a nonrecordable electroretinogram. These findings are consistent with retinitis pigmentosa, a genetic disorder that causes progressive degeneration of the photoreceptor cells in the retina. Genetic testing can identify the specific gene mutation that is causing the patient's condition. This information can be helpful in planning treatment and providing genetic counseling to the patient and their family.
* **B: Order antiretinal antibodies.** Antiretinal antibodies may be present in patients with retinitis pigmentosa, but they are not specific for this disorder. Antiretinal antibodies are antibodies that attack the photoreceptor cells in the retina. They can be detected in the blood or in the vitreous humor of the eye. The presence of antiretinal antibodies does not necessarily mean that the patient has retinitis pigmentosa. Other conditions, such as autoimmune diseases, can also cause the production of antiretinal antibodies.
* **C: Perform systemic evaluation for malignancy.** Systemic evaluation for malignancy is not necessary in the absence of other signs or symptoms of malignancy. Retinitis pigmentosa is not a malignancy. It is a genetic disorder that causes progressive degeneration of the photoreceptor cells in the retina. There is no evidence to suggest that retinitis pigmentosa is associated with an increased risk of malignancy.
* **D: Review medications.** Reviewing medications is a reasonable step, but it is unlikely to be the most helpful next step in this case. The patient's medications are not likely to be causing her night blindness, ring scotoma, and nonrecordable electroretinogram. These findings are consistent with retinitis pigmentosa, a genetic disorder that causes progressive degeneration of the photoreceptor cells in the retina.

 41%|████      | 625/1525 [2:24:04<3:02:50, 12.19s/it]The correct answer is: D. Initiate corticosteroids.

The patient has optic disc edema in the right eye with a history of double vision and graying of vision on eccentric gaze. These symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of optic neuritis, which is an inflammation of the optic nerve. Optic neuritis is most commonly caused by multiple sclerosis (MS), but it can also be caused by other conditions such as sarcoidosis, Lyme disease, and viral infections.

The first-line treatment for optic neuritis is corticosteroids, which can help to reduce inflammation and improve vision. In patients with MS, corticosteroids can also help to delay the onset of further attacks.

Lumbar puncture is not routinely recommended in the management of optic neuritis. However, it may be indicated in patients with suspected MS or other demyelinating diseases.

Another MRI scan of the orbit is not necessary in the absence of new symptoms or signs.

Risk factor modification is important in the management of MS, but it is not the first-line treatment for optic neuritis.

Central serous chorioretinopathy (CSR) is a common, self-limiting disorder of the macula, the central part of the retina. It is characterized by the accumulation of fluid under the retina, which can cause blurred vision. In most cases, CSR will resolve on its own within a few weeks to months. However, if the fluid persists for more than 3 months, photodynamic therapy may be recommended.

Photodynamic therapy is a procedure that uses a light-activated drug to destroy abnormal blood vessels in the eye. This can help to reduce the amount of fluid that accumulates under the retina. Photodynamic therapy is generally safe and effective, but it can cause some side effects, such as blurred vision and light sensitivity.

In the case of the patient in the question, he has a history of CSR in his left eye that resolved on its own. He now has bilateral CSR that has persisted for 2 weeks. Given that he has no other risk factors for serious underlying disease, it is reasonable to observe him for a further 3 months before considering photodynamic therapy.

A complete blood cell count (CBC) is not necessary in this case, as it is not likely to provide any additional information. Ordering tests for syphilis, tuberculosis, and sarcoidosis is also not necessary, as these conditions are unlikely to be the cause of CSR in a middle-aged man. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits is also not necessary, as it is not likely to reveal any abnormalities that would explain the patient's CSR.

Therefore, the best course of action is to observe the patient for a further 3 months and offer photodynamic therapy if the subretinal fluid persists.

Explanation: The patient has a rapidly enlarging scalp lesion that is itchy but without generalized pruritus. He also has a history of weight loss and abdominal pain. These symptoms are consistent with mycosis fungoides, a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Follicular lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that typically presents with lymphadenopathy, not skin lesions. Lichen planus is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that typically presents with flat-topped, violaceous papules. Marginal zone lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that typically presents with lymphadenopathy, not skin lesions.

The biopsy specimen from the skin lesion shows a dense infiltrate of atypical lymphocytes in the dermis. This is consistent with a diagnosis of mycosis fungoides.

Explanation: The patient is hemodynamically unstable and has inferior ST-segment elevation on electrocardiogram. This suggests acute myocardial infarction (MI) involving the inferior wall of the left ventricle. The patient's history is significant for remote percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), which suggests that he has coronary artery disease. The next step in management is to perform coronary angiography to identify the culprit lesion and perform PCI. Determining the severity of the left anterior descending artery plaque by measuring fractional flow reserve is not necessary in this case, as the patient has acute MI. Pursuing the culprit coronary artery as yet not identified is also not necessary, as the patient has already had PCI to the left anterior descending artery. Order urgent computed tomography angiography is not necessary in this case, as the patient has already had coronary angiography.

The patient has an elevated AFP level, which is a marker of hepatocellular carcinoma. The CT scan showed multiple hypoattenuating masses with rim enhancement throughout the liver, which are consistent with hepatocellular carcinoma. The pancreatic tail mass is also concerning for malignancy.

A PET scan is a nuclear medicine imaging technique that uses a radioactive tracer to detect cancer. The tracer is injected into the bloodstream and travels to the areas of the body where cancer is most likely to be found. The PET scan can help to determine the extent of the cancer and whether it has spread to other parts of the body.

The other options are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate next steps in the management of this patient. FOLFIRINOX is a chemotherapy regimen that is used to treat metastatic colorectal cancer. Sorafenib is a targeted therapy that is used to treat hepatocellular carcinoma. Endoscopic ultrasound of the pancreas with fine-needle aspiration is a procedure that is used to diagnose pancreatic cancer. However, these options are not the most appropriate next steps in the management of this patient because they do not provide enough information to make a diagnosis or determine the best course of treatment.

The patient in this case presented with wheezing and dyspnea, which are symptoms that can be caused by an intratracheal mass. The CT scan showed a 1.1-cm nodular lesion in the upper trachea that appeared to be originating from the right lobe of the thyroid. The patient also had a serum calcitonin level of 23 pg/mL, which is elevated in patients with medullary thyroid cancer (MTC). The MRI showed a hyperintense tracheal mass on T2-weighted imaging that showed enhancement on administration of contrast medium. These findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of MTC.

Amyloidosis is a disease characterized by the deposition of amyloid, an abnormal protein, in various tissues and organs. Amyloidosis can cause a variety of symptoms, including dyspnea, but it is not typically associated with an intratracheal mass.

A benign thyroid rest is a small nodule of thyroid tissue that is found outside of the thyroid gland. Benign thyroid rests are usually asymptomatic and do not require treatment.

A mucoid pseudotumor is a rare, benign tumor that can occur in the trachea. Mucoid pseudotumors are typically asymptomatic and do not require treatment.

In conclusion, the patient in this case most likely has MTC. The CT scan, MRI, and serum calcitonin level findings are all consistent with this diagnosis. MTC is a rare type of thyroid cancer, but it is aggressive and can be fatal if not treated. The patient should be referred to a specialist for further evaluation and treatment.

Explanation:

GPA is a systemic vasculitis that can affect any organ system, but most commonly affects the lungs, kidneys, and upper respiratory tract. The characteristic pathologic finding in GPA is a granulomatous inflammation with giant cells. This is consistent with the findings on the patient's sinonasal mucosal biopsy.

Lymphoma is a malignancy of the lymphatic system. It can affect any organ system, but most commonly affects the lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow. The characteristic pathologic finding in lymphoma is a proliferation of malignant lymphocytes. This is not consistent with the findings on the patient's sinonasal mucosal biopsy.

Acute invasive fungal sinusitis is a fungal infection of the sinuses. It is most common in immunocompromised patients. The characteristic pathologic finding in acute invasive fungal sinusitis is a necrotizing fungal infection. This is not consistent with the findings on the patient's sinonasal mucosal biopsy.

Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma is a rare type of cancer that originates in the sinuses. It is most common in adults over the age of 50.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) is a rare autoimmune disease that affects the blood vessels, kidneys, lungs, and other organs. It is characterized by the formation of granulomas, which are clumps of immune cells that can damage tissue. GPA is often associated with relapsing polychondritis, which is a condition that causes inflammation and damage to cartilage.

The patient in this case presents with a number of features that are consistent with GPA, including nasal pain and swelling, progressive for 6 weeks; difficulty swallowing; headache; and nasal drainage. The patient was also hospitalized for this problem at an outside hospital and treated with antibiotics, without improvement. The swelling worsened and extended to his upper lip.

Axial and sagittal contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) demonstrated marked soft tissue swelling and fullness with abnormal enhancement along the nasal cavity, including bilateral nasal ala, with areas of necrosis and emphysema. No significant bony erosion or associated calcification on bone windows was noted. After bedside debridement of the nasal soft tissue region, axial postcontrast T1-weighted fat-suppressed and sagittal T2-weighted fat-suppressed magnetic resonance imaging through the nasal cavity demonstrated soft tissue fullness isointense to muscle on T1-weighted images, hyperintense on T2-weighted images, and with homogenous enhancement of the solid component on postcontrast T1-weighted images. No intracranial or intraorbital disease extension was noted.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of GPA. The presence of granulomas on biopsy would confirm the diagnosis.

Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that can also occur in the nose. However, it is not typically associated with the other symptoms that this patient is experiencing.

Necrotizing fasciitis is a serious infection of the skin and underlying tissue that can lead to death. It is not typically associated with the other symptoms that this patient is experiencing.

Extranodal T-cell lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the white blood cells. It is not typically associated with the other symptoms that this patient is experiencing.

Explanation:

The patient presented with a left posterior triangle neck mass that had progressed for 3 years following a motor vehicle accident. On physical examination, the mass was firm, mobile, tender to palpation, and caused restricted range of motion. Ultrasound imaging of the soft tissue of the neck was obtained, which demonstrated a neck mass with dense acoustic shadowing. Further evaluation with contrasted computed tomography (CT) imaging showed a 3.3×2.9×2.6-cm ossified lesion in the left posterior-lateral cervical soft tissue near the atlanto-axial junction. The lesion was well circumscribed and separate from the underlying bone.

The most likely diagnosis is osteochondroma, which is a benign bone tumor that arises from the growth plate of a long bone. Osteochondromas are typically solitary lesions, but they can be multiple in some cases. They are most common in children and adolescents, and they typically present as a painless mass. Osteochondromas can be diagnosed with imaging studies such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRI scans. Treatment is typically surgical excision of the mass.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Osteoid osteoma is a benign bone tumor that is typically smaller than osteochondromas and does not typically cause a mass.
* Osteosarcoma is a malignant bone tumor that is rare in children and adolescents. It is typically associated with pain, swelling, and a mass.
* Myositis ossificans is a benign condition that is characterized by the formation of bone in muscle tissue. It is typically caused by trauma or inflammation.

Explanation: The patient in the case has a history of fever, rash, and abnormal liver function test results. He is also a man in his 30s, which is the age group most commonly affected by HIV infection. The patient's symptoms are consistent with acute HIV infection, which is characterized by a flu-like illness with fever, rash, and lymphadenopathy. The patient's abnormal liver function test results are also consistent with HIV infection, as HIV can cause inflammation of the liver.

An HIV immunoassay is a blood test that can be used to detect the presence of HIV antibodies. If the patient is HIV-positive, the immunoassay will be positive. If the patient is HIV-negative, the immunoassay will be negative.

Obtaining an HIV immunoassay is the next step in the evaluation of this patient. If the immunoassay is positive, the patient will need to be started on antiretroviral therapy. Antiretroviral therapy is a combination of drugs that can suppress HIV replication and prevent the progression of HIV disease.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Administering an intravenous steroid would not be helpful, as there is no evidence of an inflammatory process. Performing a liver biopsy would not be helpful, as the patient's liver function test results are already abnormal. Initiating negative-pressure isolation would not be helpful, as the patient is not contagious.

Explanation:
The patient in this case has a non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI). This is a type of heart attack that occurs when a blood clot blocks a coronary artery, but does not cause the complete blockage of the artery that is seen in ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).

The treatment for NSTEMI is typically medical therapy, which includes aspirin, a beta-blocker, and an antiplatelet agent such as clopidogrel or ticagrelor. In some cases, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may be necessary to open the blocked artery. PCI is a procedure that involves inserting a balloon into the artery to open it up. A stent may also be placed in the artery to keep it open.

In this case, the patient has already been started on medical therapy. She is also a young woman with a history of asthma, which makes her a poor candidate for PCI. Therefore, the best option for her treatment is to continue medical therapy alone.

A: Administer thrombolytic therapy is incorrect because this is a treatment for STEMI, not NSTEMI.

B: Continue medical therapy alone, with a β-blocker and antiplatelet therapy is correct because this is the standard treatment for NSTEMI.

C: Perform percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is incorrect because this is a treatment for STEMI, not NSTEMI.

The patient's serum creatinine level on day 3 postoperatively is 1.5 mg/dL, which is an increase from 0.9 mg/dL on day 2. However, this increase is not statistically significant, as the coefficient of variation for serum creatinine is 10%. This means that a 10% change in serum creatinine is within the normal range of variation and is not necessarily indicative of a change in glomerular filtration rate.

In addition, the patient's urine output on day 3 is 50 mL over 3 hours, which is within the normal range for an adult. This suggests that the patient's kidneys are still functioning adequately and that there is no evidence of acute kidney injury.

Therefore, the best interpretation of the test results from day 3 postoperatively is that there are insufficient data to conclude that a decrease in glomerular filtration rate has occurred. Further testing, such as a blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level and a creatinine clearance test, may be necessary to confirm this diagnosis.

The answer choices A, B, and C are incorrect because they are all based on the assumption that the patient's serum creatinine level has increased significantly. However, as discussed above, this increase is not statistically significant and is not necessarily indicative of a change in glomerular filtration rate.

Explanation:

Inverse lichen planus is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease that most commonly affects the flexural surfaces of the body, such as the armpits, groin, and under the breasts. It is characterized by well-defined, violaceous, annular patches without scale or erosion. The lesions are often pruritic.

The diagnosis of inverse lichen planus is made clinically and confirmed by biopsy. The histopathologic findings in inverse lichen planus are characteristic, with a band-like infiltrate of lymphocytes at the dermoepidermal junction.

Treatment of inverse lichen planus is often difficult and frustrating. Topical corticosteroids are the mainstay of therapy, but they are often not effective. Other treatment options include oral corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and phototherapy.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Familial benign pemphigus (Hailey-Hailey disease) is a rare, autosomal dominant skin disorder characterized by recurrent blisters and erosions of the skin and mucous membranes. It is not associated with violaceous annular patches.
* Fixed drug eruption is a type of drug reaction that presents with well-circumscribed, erythematous, edematous plaques that develop at the site of prior drug exposure. The lesions are often pruritic and tender.
* Erythrasma is a superficial fungal infection of the skin that is characterized by well-demarcated, erythematous, scaling patches that are often associated with a characteristic "coral red" fluorescence under Wood lamp examination. It is not associated with violaceous annular patches.

Explanation: Oral lichen planus is a chronic, inflammatory condition of the oral mucosa that presents as a white, lacy or reticulated lesion. It is characterized by atrophic epithelium, hyperkeratosis, and acanthosis. The lesions are often bilateral and symmetrical, and they can occur on any part of the oral mucosa, including the tongue. Oral lichen planus is most common in middle-aged and older adults, and it is more common in women than men. The exact cause of oral lichen planus is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder. Oral lichen planus is usually asymptomatic, but it can cause pain, burning, and sensitivity to hot and cold foods. There is no cure for oral lichen planus, but treatment can help to control the symptoms. Treatment options include topical corticosteroids, oral corticosteroids, and laser therapy.

In this case, the patient is an 80-year-old white woman with a 15-year history of oral lichen planus. She presents with an asymptomatic white patch on the tongue that has been present for 1 month. She also has a history of stage 1A mycosis fungoides/cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. The physical examination reveals a 1.5 × 1.0-cm nonremovable white, plaquelike lesion on the left lateral tongue. Biopsy specimens show hyperkeratotic, acanthotic stratified squamous epithelium exhibiting cells with lightly stained cytoplasm (balloon cells) throughout the stratum spinosum and superficial layer. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of oral lichen planus.

The other possible diagnoses are oral frictional keratosis, oral hairy leukoplakia, and oral squamous cell carcinoma. Oral frictional keratosis is a common, benign condition that occurs as a result of chronic irritation of the oral mucosa. It is characterized by a white, raised lesion that is usually located on the lateral border of the tongue. Oral hairy leukoplakia is a condition that is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). It is most common in HIV-positive patients, and it presents as a white, corrugated lesion on the lateral border of the tongue. Oral squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that can develop in the oral mucosa. It is the most common type of oral cancer, and it is more common in men than women. It presents as a red, ulcerated lesion that is often painful.

In this case, the patient's history, physical examination, and biopsy findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of oral lichen planus.

Pigmented onychomatricoma is a benign tumor of the nail matrix. It is characterized by a brown or black longitudinal band on the nail plate. The lesion is usually asymptomatic and does not extend to the proximal nail fold.

Pigmented squamous cell carcinoma in situ is a precancerous lesion of the nail bed. It is characterized by a brown or black spot on the nail plate. The lesion is usually asymptomatic and does not extend to the proximal nail fold.

Pigmented onychopapilloma is a benign tumor of the nail bed. It is characterized by a brown or black spot on the nail plate. The lesion is usually asymptomatic and does not extend to the proximal nail fold.

Subungual melanoma is a malignant tumor of the nail matrix. It is characterized by a brown or black longitudinal band on the nail plate that extends to the proximal nail fold. The lesion is usually symptomatic and may cause pain, bleeding, or nail deformity.

In the given case, the patient has a dark brown longitudinal pigment band on the second toenail with pigment extends to the proximal nail fold. The lesion is progressive and symptomatic. The patient also has no other nail or skin lesions. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of subungual melanoma.

The patient in this case has a number of risk factors for psychosis, including a recent drop in functioning, social withdrawal, and a family history of mental illness. However, he does not have any clear signs of psychosis, such as delusions or hallucinations. In addition, the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM did not reveal any mental disorder.

Given these factors, it is important to monitor the patient closely for signs of psychosis. This can be done through clinical follow-up, which involves meeting with the patient regularly to assess his mental health and provide support. Primary prevention strategies, such as education and stress management, can also be helpful in reducing the risk of psychosis.

Pharmacotherapy with low-dose atypical antipsychotics is not recommended at this time, as the patient does not have any clear signs of psychosis. Treatment with ω-3 fish oil dietary supplementation is also not recommended, as there is no evidence that it is effective in preventing psychosis.

In conclusion, the best course of action for this patient is clinical follow-up for at least 3 years and indicated primary prevention. This will allow the patient to be monitored closely for signs of psychosis and receive support if needed.

Explanation:

* **Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON)** is an inherited optic neuropathy that causes progressive bilateral loss of vision. It is caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA, and is typically diagnosed in young adults. The fundus findings in LHON include optic disc pallor and atrophy, and retinal nerve fiber layer thinning.
* **Friedreich ataxia (FA)** is an inherited ataxia that is caused by a mutation in the frataxin gene. It is characterized by progressive loss of coordination, gait ataxia, dysarthria, and nystagmus. The fundus findings in FA include optic atrophy, retinal nerve fiber layer thinning, and pigmentary retinopathy.
* **Complicated hereditary spastic paraplegia (CPS)** is a group of inherited disorders that are characterized by progressive spastic paraplegia. The fundus findings in CPS are typically normal.
* **Autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS)** is an inherited ataxia that is caused by a mutation in the SACS gene. It is characterized by progressive spastic ataxia, areflexia, and dysarthria. The fundus findings in ARSACS include optic atrophy, retinal nerve fiber layer thinning, and pigmentary retinopathy.

In the case presented, the patient is a 16-year-old girl with a history of unsteadiness and frequent falls since the age of 16 months. She has progressive worsening of her gait difficulties, and complains of loss of balance. On examination, she has saccadic pursuit, subtle appendicular ataxia, and a spastic gait with a wide base. She cannot stand or walk with her feet in the tandem position. Her muscle strength is normal. Achilles tendon reflexes and plantar responses are absent, and vibration sense is decreased in her toes and ankles. Visual acuity, color vision, and visual fields are normal. Fundoscopy reveals increased visibility of retinal nerve fibers, hiding the contours of retinal vessels bilaterally. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) showed increased thickness in the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL).

The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of ARSACS. The fundus findings of increased visibility of retinal nerve fibers, hiding the contours of retinal vessels bilaterally, are characteristic of ARSACS. The OCT findings of increased thickness in the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) are also consistent with ARSACS.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* **Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON)** is an inherited optic neuropathy that causes progressive bilateral loss of vision. It is caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA, and is typically diagnosed in young adults. The fundus findings in LHON include optic disc pallor and atrophy, and retinal nerve fiber layer thinning.

 42%|████▏     | 643/1525 [2:28:03<3:17:14, 13.42s/it]The correct answer is: C. Superior lumbar hernia (Grynfeltt-Lesshaft hernia).

Explanation:

A superior lumbar hernia is a rare type of hernia that occurs when a small piece of intestine bulges through a weak spot in the abdominal wall near the top of the spine. It is more common in women than in men, and it is usually caused by a combination of factors, including obesity, pregnancy, and previous abdominal surgery.

The symptoms of a superior lumbar hernia can vary depending on the size of the hernia and the amount of intestine that is protruding. Some people may experience no symptoms at all, while others may have pain, abdominal swelling, and constipation.

The diagnosis of a superior lumbar hernia is usually made based on a physical examination and imaging tests, such as an X-ray or computed tomography (CT) scan. If a hernia is diagnosed, it may be treated with surgery to repair the defect in the abdominal wall.

The other options are incorrect because:

* A left lateral lumbar lipoma is a benign fatty tumor that can occur in the back. It is usually not painful and does not require treatment.
* Posterior lateral muscular atrophy with pseudohernia is a condition that causes the muscles in the back to atrophy, or waste away. This can lead to the formation of a bulge in the back, but it is not a hernia.
* Postoperative infected seroma is a collection of fluid that can form after surgery. It is usually caused by an infection in the surgical site.

Explanation:
The patient's history of worsening neck and shoulder pain, paresthesia and pain radiating down his right arm, and tracheal deviation on physical examination are all consistent with a pathological vertebral body fracture. A pathological fracture is a fracture that occurs in a bone that is weakened by a disease process, such as cancer. In this case, the patient's metastatic lung cancer has weakened his vertebral bodies, making them more susceptible to fracture. The computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest shows a mass in the right lung, which is consistent with metastatic lung cancer. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the cervical and thoracic spine shows a fracture in the T4 vertebral body, which is also consistent with a pathological fracture.

The other possible diagnoses are not as likely in this case. Traumatic vertebral body fracture would be more likely if the patient had a history of recent trauma. Thyroid goiter with compressive symptoms would be more likely if the patient had a history of thyroid problems or if there was evidence of a thyroid mass on physical examination. Metastatic lung cancer is the most likely diagnosis in this case, given the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging findings.

 42%|████▏     | 645/1525 [2:28:22<2:46:42, 11.37s/it]The correct answer is: **D. Obtain a vitreous sample for culture and inject vancomycin and ceftazidime.**

The patient is a 30-year-old woman with a 2-day history of floaters in her left eye. She has no relevant medical, ocular, or family history; medication use; or allergies. The findings of a review of systems were unremarkable. A workup for posterior uveitis was initiated, and the patient began therapy with oral antiviral and oral corticosteroid medications. One week later, her symptoms had worsened, and she was referred for consultation.

The patient's best-corrected visual acuity is 20/15 OD and 20/60 OS. Intraocular pressures, extraocular movements, visual fields by confrontation, and pupil responses are normal. Anterior segment examination and dilated fundus examination of the right eye had normal findings. However, the left eye had 3+ anterior chamber cell and 1+ flare, nongranulomatous keratic precipitates, and a clear lens. The dilated fundus examination revealed 2+ vitritis, a hyperemic disc with blurred margins, macular striae with a blunted foveal reflex, and vascular sheathing with segmental periarteriolar inflammatory plaques in multiple quadrants. The peripheral retina had well-demarcated peripheral retinal whitening with scalloped margins and intraretinal hemorrhages in all quadrants. Four days later, repeat fundus photography showed that the peripheral lesions had coalesced into larger circumferential necrotic regions.

The differential diagnosis for this patient's presentation includes posterior uveitis, retinal vasculitis, and infectious endophthalmitis. Posterior uveitis is a common cause of posterior segment inflammation, and it can be caused by a variety of conditions, including infectious, autoimmune, and inflammatory disorders. Retinal vasculitis is a less common cause of posterior segment inflammation, and it can be caused by a variety of conditions, including systemic lupus erythematosus, Behçet's disease, and sarcoidosis. Infectious endophthalmitis is a rare but serious cause of posterior segment inflammation, and it is most commonly caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses.

The patient's presentation is most consistent with infectious endophthalmitis. The patient has a history of floaters in her left eye, which is a common symptom of infectious endophthalmitis. The patient also has 3+ anterior chamber cell and 1+ flare, which are signs of inflammation. The dilated fundus examination revealed 2+ vitritis, a hyperemic disc with blurred margins, macular striae with a blunted foveal reflex, and vascular sheathing with segmental periarteriolar inflammatory plaques in multiple quadrants. The peripheral retina had well-demarcated peripheral retinal whitening with scalloped margins and intraretinal hemorrhages in all quadrants. These findings are consistent with infectious endophthalmitis.

The next step in the management of this patient is to obtain a vitreous sample for culture and inject vancomycin and ceftazidime. This will help to identify the causative organism and provide appropriate antibiotic therapy. The patient should also be started on oral corticosteroids to reduce inflammation. The patient should be monitored closely for the development of complications, such as retinal detachment, macular edema, and glaucoma.

The other options are not appropriate for this patient. Injecting an antivascular endothelial growth factor agent (anti-VEGF) is not indicated for infectious endophthalmitis. Anti-VEGF agents are used to treat neovascular age-related macular degeneration and diabetic macular edema. Ordering a hypercoagulable workup and starting a regimen of aspirin, 325 mg daily, is not indicated for this patient. A hypercoagulable workup is only indicated for patients with a history of thromboembolic events. Starting a regimen of aspirin, 325 mg daily, is not indicated for this patient because she does not have a history of thromboembolic events. Obtaining an aqueous fluid sample for polymerase chain reaction and treating with antiviral agents is not indicated for this patient. Aqueous fluid PCR is only indicated for patients with suspected viral uveitis. Treating with antiviral agents is only indicated for patients with a confirmed diagnosis of viral uveitis.

 42%|████▏     | 646/1525 [2:28:38<3:08:25, 12.86s/it]The correct answer is: C. Oral corticosteroid treatment and biopsy.

The patient has a history of waxing and waning bilateral periorbital swelling, which has been successfully treated with oral prednisone in the past. The current presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of orbital pseudotumor, which is a non-neoplastic inflammatory condition of the orbit. Orbital pseudotumor is typically treated with oral corticosteroids, which can be tapered over time once the inflammation has resolved. A biopsy is often performed to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out other possible causes of the swelling, such as a tumor.

Oral antibiotic treatment is not indicated in this case because there is no evidence of infection. Surgical debulking is not typically necessary for orbital pseudotumor, although it may be used in cases of severe proptosis or optic nerve compression. Corticosteroid-sparing immunosuppressive therapy may be used in patients who do not respond to oral corticosteroids or who have steroid-related side effects. However, this is not the initial treatment of choice for orbital pseudotumor.

In conclusion, the patient should be treated with oral corticosteroids and a biopsy should be performed to confirm the diagnosis of orbital pseudotumor.

The patient has acute angle closure glaucoma in the left eye. The most common cause of acute angle closure glaucoma is pupillary block, which occurs when the iris blocks the drainage angle. This can be caused by a number of factors, including posterior synechiae, which are adhesions between the iris and the lens. In this case, the patient has posterior synechiae due to her prior laser eyebrow epilation.

The treatment for acute angle closure glaucoma is to create an opening in the iris to allow fluid to drain from the eye. This can be done with a laser or a needle. In this case, the patient should have an urgent peripheral iridotomy performed to prevent permanent damage to her vision.

The other options are incorrect because they would not treat the underlying cause of the patient's glaucoma. Increasing her topical corticosteroid dosage would not break the posterior synechiae and would not open the drainage angle. Performing an AC paracentesis and sending fluid for viral polymerase chain reaction analysis would not be helpful in this case because the patient does not have a viral infection.

 42%|████▏     | 648/1525 [2:29:04<3:08:10, 12.87s/it]The correct answer is A: Order magnetic resonance imaging of the brain with venography.

The patient has a history of blunt trauma to the left eye, which is a risk factor for traumatic optic neuropathy (TON). TON is a condition in which the optic nerve is damaged due to compression or ischemia, and it can lead to permanent vision loss.

The patient's presentation is consistent with TON, including diminished visual acuity, an afferent pupillary defect, and optic disc edema. The elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is also concerning for TON, as it can further damage the optic nerve.

MRI of the brain with venography is the best test to evaluate for TON. It can identify any underlying causes of the optic nerve damage, such as a mass lesion or vascular occlusion. If TON is diagnosed, treatment typically involves lowering the IOP and providing neuroprotective therapy.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Gonioscopy is a procedure to visualize the angle of the anterior chamber, and it is not necessary to diagnose or treat TON. Instilling a miotic agent (a medication that constricts the pupil) can lower the IOP, but it does not treat the underlying cause of TON. Performing a peripheral iridotomy is a procedure to create an opening in the iris, and it is used to treat glaucoma, not TON.

Therefore, the correct answer is A: Order magnetic resonance imaging of the brain with venography.

Explanation:
The patient in this case has a number of findings that are concerning for a diagnosis of von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL), including facial plethora, retinal vein dilatation, and a prolonged arm-to-retina transit time. VHL is an inherited genetic disorder that can cause a variety of tumors, including retinal angiomas, hemangioblastomas of the central nervous system, and renal cell carcinoma. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen is the most sensitive test for detecting renal cell carcinoma, and it is often ordered in patients with suspected VHL.

Ocular massage is not a necessary or appropriate test in this case. It is used to treat conditions such as glaucoma, which is not present in this patient.

A complete blood cell count (CBC) may be ordered as part of a routine workup, but it is not specific for VHL.

Genetic testing for the VHL gene may be ordered to confirm the diagnosis, but it is not necessary in all cases. In patients with a strong clinical suspicion of VHL, such as the patient in this case, a CT scan of the abdomen is usually the first test that is ordered.

The patient in this case has atypical white dot syndrome, which is a rare, chronic, multifocal inflammatory disorder of the choroid and retina. It is characterized by the presence of multiple, small, white subretinal deposits, often with parafoveal coalescence. The disease is typically idiopathic, but it has been associated with a number of autoimmune diseases, including ankylosing spondylitis, ulcerative colitis, and Crohn's disease.

The most common treatment for atypical white dot syndrome is systemic corticosteroids, such as prednisone. These medications can help to reduce inflammation and improve vision. In some cases, immunosuppressive agents, such as azathioprine or methotrexate, may also be used.

HLA-A29 is an HLA class I allele that is associated with an increased risk of developing atypical white dot syndrome. Testing for HLA-A29 can be helpful in making the diagnosis of this condition.

Observation is not an appropriate treatment for atypical white dot syndrome, as the disease can lead to progressive visual loss. Hematologic workup is not necessary, as there are no hematologic abnormalities associated with this condition. Vitreous biopsy is not a necessary or effective treatment for atypical white dot syndrome.

Therefore, the correct answer is: **B: Initiation of treatment with systemic corticosteroids and immunosuppression after HLA-A29 laboratory analysis**.

 43%|████▎     | 651/1525 [2:29:43<3:11:19, 13.13s/it]The correct answer is A: Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.

The patient is a young man in his early 20s with a history of smoking. He presents with pleuritic chest pain and shortness of breath, with no fever or cough. Radiography of the chest reveals an ill-defined consolidation in the right lower lung field. Laboratory investigations are significant for elevated levels of lactate dehydrogenase, C-reactive protein, and alkaline phosphatase. Computed tomography of the chest confirms the presence of a dense consolidation involving most of the right middle lobe with right hilar and subcarinal lymphadenopathy. He underwent endobronchial ultrasonography-guided transbronchial needle aspiration of a fleshy, whitish endobronchial lesion obstructing both uptakes to the medial and lateral segments. Histologic analysis revealed a poorly differentiated malignant neoplasm. Most of the cells were relatively monotonous, with enlarged vesicular nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and a high ratio of nucleus to cytoplasm. Foci of abrupt squamous differentiation, including keratinization and intercellular bridges, were identified. Immunohistochemical staining showed tumor cells to be strongly and diffusely positive for keratin AE1/AE3, cytokeratin 5/6, and p63. However, findings were negative for S-100, melan A, placental alkaline phosphatase, CD56, thyroid transcription factor-1, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase, CD45, and cytokeratin 7. A positron emission tomography–computed tomography scan showed a fludeoxyglucose-enhanced avid right middle lobe mass, a large right-sided pleural effusion, and fludeoxyglucose-enhanced avid mediastinal and right hilar lymph nodes, with extensive skeletal metastases to both proximal humeri and scapulae, the sacrum, spine, iliac bones, and both hips.

Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung is the most common type of lung cancer, accounting for about 30% of all cases. It is typically a disease of older adults, with a median age at diagnosis of 70 years. However, it can occur in younger people, especially those who smoke. The risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma of the lung is increased by smoking, exposure to asbestos, and exposure to radon.

The clinical presentation of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung varies depending on the stage of the disease. At early stages, the tumor may be asymptomatic or cause only mild symptoms, such as a cough. As the tumor grows, it can cause more significant symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, and weight loss.

The diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung is made based on a combination of clinical findings, imaging studies, and biopsy. Imaging studies, such as a chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) scan, can help to determine the size and location of the tumor. A biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and to determine the stage of the disease.

The treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung depends on the stage of the disease. At early stages, the tumor may be treated with surgery, followed by radiation therapy and chemotherapy. At later stages, the tumor may be treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

The prognosis for squamous cell carcinoma of the lung varies depending on the stage of the disease. At early stages, the tumor is often curable. However, at later stages, the tumor is often incurable and the prognosis is poor.

The answer choices for this question are:

A. Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung
B. Carcinoid tumor
C. Primary malignant mediastinal germ cell tumor
D. Nuclear protein in testis midline carcinoma

The correct answer is A: Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung. This is the most likely diagnosis based on the patient's history, physical examination, laboratory findings, imaging studies, and biopsy results. The other answer choices are less likely diagnoses.

B. Carcinoid tumor is a type of neuroendocrine tumor that can occur in the lung. It is typically a slow-growing tumor that is often curable. The patient in this case does not have any of the typical symptoms of carcinoid tumor, such as flushing, diarrhea, and wheezing. Additionally, the biopsy results do not show any evidence of carcinoid tumor.

C. Primary malignant mediastinal germ cell tumor is a rare type of cancer that can occur in the mediastinum. It is typically a disease of young adults. The patient in this case is older than the typical patient with primary malignant mediastinal germ cell tumor. Additionally, the biopsy results do not show any evidence of germ cell tumor.

D. Nuclear protein in testis midline carcinoma is a rare type of cancer that can occur in the testes. It is typically a disease of young adults. The patient in this case is older than the typical patient with nuclear protein in testis midline carcinoma. Additionally, the biopsy results do not show any evidence of nuclear protein in testis midline carcinoma.

 43%|████▎     | 652/1525 [2:30:00<3:25:21, 14.11s/it]The correct answer is: **B: Computed tomography of the head.**

A computed tomography (CT) scan of the head is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient. The patient is comatose and has a history of deep vein thrombosis, which are risk factors for cerebral thromboembolism. A CT scan of the head can quickly and easily identify any evidence of intracranial hemorrhage or infarction, which would be important to know in order to guide further management.

Cardiac catheterization, pulmonary computed tomography angiography, and transesophageal echocardiography are all important diagnostic tests that may be necessary in the management of this patient, but they are not the most appropriate next step. Cardiac catheterization can be used to diagnose and treat coronary artery disease, but it is not necessary in this patient who has no history of chest pain or other symptoms of coronary artery disease. Pulmonary computed tomography angiography can be used to diagnose and treat pulmonary embolism, but it is not necessary in this patient who has no history of deep vein thrombosis and no evidence of pulmonary embolism on the CT scan of the chest. Transesophageal echocardiography can be used to diagnose and treat valvular heart disease, but it is not necessary in this patient who has no history of heart disease and no evidence of valvular heart disease on the TTE.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is a CT scan of the head.

Explanation:

The patient is a cigarette smoker in his 50s with a history of hypertension, chronic kidney disease, colon adenocarcinoma, and hyperuricemia. He presented with a right vocal fold mass that had been an incidental finding during esophagogastroduodenoscopy. He denied any symptoms related to the lesion, including dysphonia or dysphagia, and reported no fevers or weight loss. Rigid stroboscopy revealed normal vocal fold mobility and a nodular cystic-appearing lesion on the posterior inferior border of the right vocal process. There was no overlying ulceration, and vocal fold mucosal wave was intact in the adjacent membranous vocal fold. Suspension microlaryngoscopy incisional biopsy of the right infraglottic lesion was performed in the operating room. The endotracheal tube was displaced anteriorly with the laryngoscope. Intraoperatively, there was submucosal white caseous debris in the substance of the lesion. The surgical specimen was sent for histopathologic analysis. Cultures were analyzed for the presence of fungus, bacteria, and mycobacteria. Postoperatively, the patient was doing well and continued to have no symptoms of dysphagia or dysphonia.

The most likely diagnosis is laryngeal amyloidosis. This is a rare condition in which amyloid protein deposits accumulate in the larynx, causing hoarseness, dysphagia, and airway obstruction. Amyloidosis can be caused by a number of conditions, including multiple myeloma, amyloid light chain (AL) amyloidosis, and hereditary amyloidosis. The diagnosis is made by biopsy of the affected tissue, which shows characteristic amyloid deposits. Treatment is aimed at the underlying cause, if possible, and may also include medications to reduce the production of amyloid protein or to remove the amyloid deposits.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely. Laryngeal tuberculosis is a rare condition that is usually seen in patients with HIV infection or other immunocompromised conditions. The patient in this case does not have any risk factors for tuberculosis. Laryngeal gout is a condition in which uric acid crystals deposit in the larynx, causing inflammation and pain. The patient in this case does not have any symptoms of gout, and there is no evidence of uric acid crystals on the biopsy. Vocal fold granuloma is a benign lesion that can be caused by vocal abuse or chronic inflammation. The patient in this case does not have any risk factors for vocal fold granuloma, and the lesion on the biopsy is not typical of a granuloma.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is laryngeal amyloidosis.

ALHE is a rare, benign, inflammatory condition of the lymph nodes that is characterized by the presence of lymphocytes, eosinophils, and histiocytes. It is most commonly seen in adults, and there is no gender predilection. The most common presentation is a painless, solitary lymph node that is located in the head and neck region. However, ALHE can also involve lymph nodes in other parts of the body, such as the axilla, groin, and mediastinum.

The diagnosis of ALHE is based on clinical presentation, imaging studies, and biopsy. The characteristic histopathologic findings of ALHE include a proliferation of lymphocytes, eosinophils, and histiocytes. These cells are arranged in a storiform pattern, which is a characteristic feature of ALHE.

The treatment of ALHE is typically not necessary, as the condition is usually self-limited. However, if the lymph nodes are large or symptomatic, they can be treated with steroids or surgery.

The other possible diagnoses are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of lymphoma that is characterized by the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells. Reed-Sternberg cells are large, atypical cells that are found in the lymph nodes. Hodgkin lymphoma is a serious condition that can be fatal if not treated.
* Tubercular lymphadenitis is a type of lymphadenitis that is caused by the tuberculosis bacterium. Tubercular lymphadenitis is a serious condition that can be fatal if not treated.
* Kimura disease is a rare, chronic inflammatory condition that is characterized by the enlargement of lymph nodes, particularly in the head and neck region. Kimura disease is more common in men than women, and it is usually diagnosed in adults. The cause of Kimura disease is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune condition. There is no cure for Kimura disease, but it can be treated with steroids or surgery.

Explanation:

The patient in the case presented with a rapidly enlarging parapharyngeal mass. The mass was initially thought to be a carcinoma, but the biopsy was nondiagnostic. The patient then underwent a transcervical resection with transoral partial glossectomy, palatectomy, and pharyngectomy with reconstruction. Results of immunohistochemical analysis of the removed tissue were positive for CD4 (weak), CD21, CD23, and vimentin with a low proliferation rate. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of follicular dendritic cell sarcoma.

Follicular dendritic cell sarcoma is a rare, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that typically affects the lymph nodes. However, it can also occur in extranodal sites, such as the parapharyngeal space. The disease is characterized by the proliferation of follicular dendritic cells, which are a type of dendritic cell that plays a role in the immune response. Follicular dendritic cell sarcoma is typically a slow-growing tumor, but it can be aggressive in some cases. The treatment for follicular dendritic cell sarcoma is typically surgery, followed by radiation therapy and chemotherapy. The prognosis for patients with follicular dendritic cell sarcoma varies depending on the stage of the disease, but the overall survival rate is approximately 50%.

The other possible diagnoses in this case are not as likely. Poorly undifferentiated carcinoma is a type of cancer that is difficult to classify. It is typically a very aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis. Ectopic thymoma is a rare tumor that originates from the thymus gland. It is typically a slow-growing tumor that is not very aggressive. Peripheral nerve sheath tumor is a type of tumor that arises from the nerves. It is typically a slow-growing tumor that is not very aggressive.

In conclusion, the patient in the case presented with a rapidly enlarging parapharyngeal mass. The mass was initially thought to be a carcinoma, but the biopsy was nondiagnostic. The patient then underwent a transcervical resection with transoral partial glossectomy, palatectomy, and pharyngectomy with reconstruction. Results of immunohistochemical analysis of the removed tissue were positive for CD4 (weak), CD21, CD23, and vimentin with a low proliferation rate.

Explanation:

The patient has a history of multiple risk factors for right-sided endocarditis, including bariatric surgery, hysterectomy, pulmonary thromboendarterectomy, and ovarian stimulation for in-vitro fertilization. She also has multiple lung nodules, which can be a sign of endocarditis. Cardiac echocardiography is the most accurate test to diagnose endocarditis, so it is the next best step in management.

A: Observe only is not the correct answer because the patient has multiple risk factors for right-sided endocarditis and multiple lung nodules. These findings warrant further investigation, including cardiac echocardiography.

C: Refer the patient to oncology for chemotherapy is not the correct answer because the patient's lung nodules are not necessarily cancerous. Chemotherapy is a treatment for cancer, and it is not appropriate to start chemotherapy without first confirming that the patient has cancer.

D: Start treatment with sirolimus is not the correct answer because sirolimus is a drug that is used to prevent rejection after organ transplantation. It is not appropriate to start treatment with sirolimus without first confirming that the patient has a condition that requires this medication.

Explanation: The patient has a hyperpigmented macule on the medial side of her right palm with loss of touch and temperature sensation over the involved area. A thickened, nontender ulnar nerve was palpated on the ipsilateral side in the olecranon fossa. These findings are consistent with leprosy, a chronic granulomatous disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. Leprosy can affect the skin, nerves, eyes, and mucous membranes. The diagnosis of leprosy is made based on clinical findings, including a skin biopsy. Treatment of leprosy is with multidrug therapy (MDT), which includes a combination of isoniazid, rifampin, dapsone, and clofazimine. MDT is very effective in treating leprosy and preventing complications.

In this case, the patient has already been prescribed 1 dose each of doxycycline, ofloxacin, and rifampin, but she has experienced no improvement. These antibiotics are not effective against M. leprae. Therefore, the next step in management is to perform a diagnostic biopsy of the hyperpigmented area and right ulnar nerve. This will confirm the diagnosis of leprosy and allow for appropriate treatment with MDT.

A is incorrect because further treatment is indicated. The patient has a hyperpigmented macule on the medial side of her right palm with loss of touch and temperature sensation over the involved area. A thickened, nontender ulnar nerve was palpated on the ipsilateral side in the olecranon fossa. These findings are consistent with leprosy, a chronic granulomatous disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. Leprosy can affect the skin, nerves, eyes, and mucous membranes. The diagnosis of leprosy is made based on clinical findings, including a skin biopsy. Treatment of leprosy is with multidrug therapy (MDT), which includes a combination of isoniazid, rifampin, dapsone, and clofazimine. MDT is very effective in treating leprosy and preventing complications.

C is incorrect because a 6-month course of isoniazid, rifampin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide is not the appropriate treatment for leprosy. The standard treatment for leprosy is multidrug therapy (MDT), which includes a combination of isoniazid, rifampin, dapsone, and clofazimine. MDT is very effective in treating leprosy and preventing complications.

D is incorrect because a 12-month course of dapsone combined with rifampin is not the appropriate treatment for leprosy. The standard treatment for leprosy is multidrug therapy (MDT), which includes a combination of isoniazid, rifampin, dapsone, and clofazimine. MDT is very effective in treating leprosy and preventing complications.

Explanation:
The patient has a history of chronic hepatitis C, which is a liver disease that can cause scarring of the liver. Scarring of the liver can lead to cirrhosis, which is a late stage of liver disease.

The patient's laboratory studies show that he has elevated liver enzymes, which are proteins that are released into the bloodstream when the liver is damaged. Elevated liver enzymes can be a sign of liver disease.

The patient's VCTE was negative for significant fibrosis at 6.7 kPa. However, VCTE is not a perfect test and can sometimes give false-negative results.

Therefore, the patient needs a liver biopsy to confirm the stage of his liver fibrosis. A liver biopsy is a procedure in which a small piece of liver tissue is removed and examined under a microscope. This can provide the most accurate information about the stage of liver fibrosis.

A: The patient has cirrhosis.

This is incorrect because the patient's laboratory studies and VCTE do not show evidence of cirrhosis.

B: The patient has a healthy liver.

This is incorrect because the patient has a history of chronic hepatitis C, which can cause liver damage.

C: The patient has minimal fibrosis.

Explanation:

* Masked hypertension is a condition in which a person's blood pressure is normal when measured in a doctor's office (office blood pressure) but high when measured outside of the office (ambulatory blood pressure).
* The patient in this case has a normal office blood pressure of 127/74 mm Hg, but an elevated ambulatory blood pressure of 133/86 mm Hg overall, 135/88 mm Hg during the day, and 124/78 mm Hg at night.
* This suggests that the patient has masked hypertension.
* Masked hypertension is a common condition, affecting up to 30% of people with hypertension.
* It is important to diagnose and treat masked hypertension, as it can increase the risk of heart attack, stroke, and other cardiovascular problems.

The other options are incorrect because:

* Option A is incorrect because the patient's ambulatory blood pressure is elevated.
* Option C is incorrect because the patient's office blood pressure is normal.
* Option D is incorrect because the patient's blood pressure does not dip appropriately during sleep.

Explanation:

Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that most commonly affects the genital and perianal areas, but can also occur on the palms and soles. It is characterized by white, atrophic plaques with a shiny surface and telangiectasias. The lesions may be pruritic and painful.

Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans is a chronic skin condition that is characterized by atrophic, erythematous plaques on the extremities. It is associated with infection with Borrelia burgdorferi, the bacterium that causes Lyme disease.

Acquired palmoplantar keratoderma is a rare, inherited disorder characterized by thickening of the skin on the palms and soles. It can be associated with other systemic diseases, such as psoriasis and ichthyosis.

Sclerotylosis (Huriez syndrome) is a rare, genetic disorder characterized by thickening of the skin on the palms and soles, as well as other features such as short stature, joint contractures, and dental abnormalities.

In this case, the patient is a woman in her 60s who presents with a pruritic and sometimes burning hyperpigmented eruption on the bilateral palms. The eruption has gradually spread from the left palm to the right palm and then focally onto the bilateral volar aspect of the wrists in recent months. She has not experienced involvement of the plantar surfaces. No additional concerns were reported, and there was no family history of similar lesions. There was no known history of travel in relation to onset of the lesions. Limited clinical examination revealed well-marginated brown atrophic patches on the bilateral palms extending focally onto the volar aspect of the wrist and centrally surmounted by spiny keratotic pits in the palmar creases. Two punch biopsy specimens were obtained for diagnostic clarification.

The clinical features of this case are most consistent with lichen sclerosus et atrophicus. The atrophic, erythematous plaques with telangiectasias are characteristic of this condition. The fact that the lesions are pruritic and painful is also consistent with lichen sclerosus et atrophicus.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely. Acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans is usually associated with infection with Borrelia burgdorferi, and the patient in this case does not have a history of Lyme disease. Acquired palmoplantar keratoderma is a rare, inherited disorder, and the patient in this case does not have a family history of the condition. Sclerotylosis (Huriez syndrome) is a rare, genetic disorder, and the patient in this case does not have any of the other features of the syndrome, such as short stature, joint contractures, or dental abnormalities.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is lichen sclerosus et atrophicus.

Explanation:

Trichodysplasia spinulosa is a rare, acquired, non-inflammatory, follicular disorder characterized by the presence of multiple, small, hair-like projections (keratin spines) projecting from the follicular orifices. It is most commonly seen in patients with renal failure or on immunosuppressive therapy. The lesions are usually asymptomatic, but can be pruritic. The diagnosis is made clinically and confirmed by biopsy. There is no specific treatment, but the lesions may resolve spontaneously or with treatment of the underlying condition.

In the case presented, the patient is a woman in her 70s with a 1-year history of a facial cutaneous eruption initially affecting malar cheeks and eyebrows. Subsequently it spread to involve nose, chin, upper trunk, and extremities. The lesions were mildly pruritic. Her medical history included a cadaveric renal transplant 2 years earlier for end-stage renal failure. Immunosuppressant medications included mycophenolate mofetil, 200 mg, twice daily and tacrolimus, 8 mg, twice daily. Tacrolimus levels were therapeutic. Physical examination revealed multiple 1-mm flesh-colored follicular papules and keratin spines against a diffuse erythematous background affecting the face (Figure, A and B) and upper trunk. Her scalp and eyebrow hairs were unremarkable. Serology results were unremarkable. Results of skin biopsy from the right ear demonstrated dilatation and keratotic plugging of the hair infundibula with marked dystrophy and expansion of the inner root sheath. The inner root sheath cells were enlarged with irregular trichohyaline granules and apoptotic cells with abrupt cornification without formation of a granular layer (Figure, C). Immunohistochemical analysis for SV40 polyomavirus was positive (Figure, D).

The clinical presentation, histopathology, and positive immunohistochemical staining for SV40 polyomavirus are all consistent with a diagnosis of trichodysplasia spinulosa. The other options are incorrect because they do not fit the clinical presentation or histopathology of the patient's condition.

Erythema papulosa semicircularis recidivans (EPSR) is a benign skin condition that is characterized by the appearance of recurrent, semicircular, erythematous papules. The lesions typically occur on the trunk and upper extremities, and they may be pruritic. The cause of EPSR is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune condition. There is no specific treatment for EPSR, but the lesions usually resolve spontaneously within a few weeks.

In the case presented, the patient is a healthy woman in her 50s who has a 20-year history of recurrent annular plaques on the trunk that appear every summer and resolve by autumn. The lesions are not associated with any systemic symptoms, and they do not respond to conventional antihistamine therapy or topical steroids. The physical examination reveals a large, 35-cm semicircular erythematous plaque on the lower back with central clearing and a distinctive, well-demarcated papular border. The histopathology of the lesion shows a superficial sparse perivascular inflammatory infiltrate composed mainly of lymphocytes and few neutrophils. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of EPSR.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Granuloma annulare is a chronic, granulomatous skin disease that is characterized by the appearance of one or more raised, red or skin-colored papules. The lesions typically occur on the hands, feet, and arms, but they can occur anywhere on the body. The cause of granuloma annulare is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune condition. There is no specific treatment for granuloma annulare, but the lesions usually resolve spontaneously within a few months.
* Deep erythema annulare centrifugum is a rare, chronic skin condition that is characterized by the appearance of large, erythematous plaques with central clearing and a well-demarcated, papular border. The lesions typically occur on the trunk and extremities, and they may be pruritic. The cause of deep erythema annulare centrifugum is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune condition. There is no specific treatment for deep erythema annulare centrifugum, but the lesions usually resolve spontaneously within a few months.
* Erythema chronicum migrans is a skin rash that is caused by the bite of an infected tick. The rash typically starts as a small, red macule or papule that expands centrifugally over days to weeks to form a large, erythematous annular lesion with central clearing. The lesion may be associated with systemic symptoms such as fever, headache, and fatigue. The diagnosis of erythema chronicum migrans is made based on the clinical presentation and the history of a tick bite. The treatment of erythema chronicum migrans is with antibiotics.

Explanation:

The patient presented with bilateral loss of vision and hearing, a history of painful paresthesias at his feet, and elevated thyrotropin levels. On examination, he had length-dependent loss of vibratory sensation and absent reflexes at both lower extremities. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated abnormal enhancement of bilateral optic nerves. Laboratory tests were notable for elevated thyrotropin levels and low levels of free thyroxine. The patient was treated empirically with high-dose steroids and plasmapheresis, with no improvement in symptoms.

These findings are consistent with cobalt toxicity. Cobalt is a heavy metal that is used in a variety of industrial applications, including the manufacture of alloys, batteries, and magnets. It can also be found in some foods, such as seafood and organ meats. Cobalt toxicity can cause a variety of symptoms, including vision loss, hearing loss, peripheral neuropathy, and cardiomyopathy. The diagnosis of cobalt toxicity is based on a history of exposure to cobalt, along with characteristic clinical findings and laboratory abnormalities. Treatment of cobalt toxicity involves removing the source of exposure and providing supportive care. In severe cases, chelation therapy may be necessary.

The other possible diagnoses are not consistent with the patient's presentation. Neuromyelitis optica (Devic disease) is an autoimmune disorder that affects the optic nerves and spinal cord. It typically presents with acute optic neuritis and transverse myelitis. Amyloidosis is a group of disorders that are characterized by the deposition of amyloid protein in various tissues and organs. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, weight loss, and organ dysfunction. Susac syndrome is a rare disorder that affects the small blood vessels in the brain, eyes, and ears. It typically presents with hearing loss, vision loss, and headache.

In conclusion, the patient's presentation is most consistent with cobalt toxicity.

Explanation: The patient's history of sudden-onset, constant, right lower quadrant abdominal pain associated with vomiting and melena is consistent with a diagnosis of diverticulitis with perforation. The patient's laboratory results are also consistent with this diagnosis, as the leukocytosis and elevated lactate concentration suggest an inflammatory process. The computed tomography scan shows segmental mural thickening of the anterior cecum with wall hypoenhancement and pneumatosis, adjacent fat stranding, and a lucency medial to the cecum. These findings are also consistent with a diagnosis of diverticulitis with perforation.

Acute appendicitis is a common cause of right lower quadrant pain, but it is typically associated with fever and leukocytosis. The patient's history and laboratory results do not support a diagnosis of acute appendicitis.

Colonic ischemia is a less common cause of right lower quadrant pain, but it is more likely to occur in patients with risk factors such as atherosclerosis, diabetes, and heart failure. The patient's history and laboratory results do not support a diagnosis of colonic ischemia.

Infectious colitis is a possible cause of right lower quadrant pain, but it is typically associated with fever, diarrhea, and leukocytosis. The patient's history and laboratory results do not support a diagnosis of infectious colitis.

 44%|████▎     | 665/1525 [2:33:06<3:42:40, 15.54s/it]The answer is A. Rupture of an infected endometriotic implant.

The patient is a postmenopausal woman with a known history of endometriosis and adenomyosis. She presents with severe abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal bloating. On examination, she has a palpable nodule in the posterior vaginal fornix and fullness in the left lower quadrant of the abdomen. Laboratory investigations show an elevated cancer antigen 125 level. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) reveals multiple abnormal findings that include a bulky uterus with a thickened myometrium, endometriomas, right pleural effusion, pelvic peritonitis and ascites, enlarged lymph nodes, and solid extracolonic implants in the omentum caudal to the transverse colon and in the cul-de-sac adjacent to the upper rectum. Subsequent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows 2 areas of focus corresponding with the extracolonic implants.

The most likely diagnosis is rupture of an infected endometriotic implant. Endometriosis is a condition in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus (endometrium) grows outside the uterus. This can occur in the ovaries, fallopian tubes, abdomen, bladder, bowel, or other areas. Endometriosis can cause pain, infertility, and other problems.

When endometriosis implants rupture, they can bleed and become infected. This can lead to severe abdominal pain, fever, and other symptoms. The diagnosis of endometriosis can be made with a physical examination, imaging tests (such as CT or MRI), and blood tests.

The treatment of endometriosis depends on the severity of the symptoms and the location of the implants. Treatment options include medications, surgery, or a combination of both.

In this case, the patient has a history of endometriosis and adenomyosis, both of which are risk factors for endometriosis implants. The patient also has multiple abnormal findings on CT and MRI that are consistent with endometriosis implants. The patient's symptoms are also consistent with a ruptured endometriotic implant. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is rupture of an infected endometriotic implant.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

B. Inflamed diverticulum: Diverticulitis is a condition in which small pouches form in the lining of the colon. These pouches can become infected and inflamed, causing abdominal pain, fever, and other symptoms. However, diverticulitis is more common in older adults and is not typically associated with a history of endometriosis.

C. Perforation by foreign bodies: This is a rare cause of abdominal pain in postmenopausal women. It is more likely to occur in women who have had recent surgery or who have a history of abdominal trauma.

D. Malignant growth with unknown primary tumor: This is a possibility, but it is less likely given the patient's history and presentation. Malignant growths are more likely to occur in older adults and are not typically associated with a history of endometriosis.

The patient has a history of hypothyroidism, a 10-month history of painless lumps in her neck, and a 2-month history of achiness and decreased visual acuity in her right eye. She also has associated symptoms of dysphagia, fever, and chills. A previous otolaryngology evaluation revealed an intranasal mass with enlargement of multiple submandibular lymph nodes. A needle aspiration biopsy of one of the submandibular lymph nodes revealed atypical cells with mature lymphocytes. Computed tomography of the sinus confirmed a nasal polyp and a soft tissue mass in the right lacrimal gland region. The excised nasal polyp was benign. Incisional biopsy of the lacrimal gland lesion revealed chronic inflammatory infiltrate composed of predominantly T cells with scattered B cells and mature plasma cells, but no evidence of a lymphoproliferative process.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of Sjögren's syndrome. Sjögren's syndrome is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the exocrine glands, including the lacrimal and salivary glands. Symptoms of Sjögren's syndrome can include dry eyes, dry mouth, fatigue, joint pain, and Raynaud's phenomenon.

The patient's initial treatment with oral corticosteroids was not successful in controlling her symptoms. The next step in her management is to perform a second lacrimal gland biopsy. This will help to confirm the diagnosis of Sjögren's syndrome and to determine the extent of the disease. If the biopsy shows that the patient has Sjögren's syndrome, she may be treated with a combination of medications, including oral corticosteroids, immunosuppressive drugs, and topical medications.

The other options are not appropriate for this patient. Option A (treat with oral corticosteroids) has already been tried and was not successful. Option B (treat with methotrexate sodium) is a treatment option for Sjögren's syndrome, but it is not the next step in this patient's management. Option C (perform external beam radiotherapy to the orbit) is a treatment option for some types of cancer, but it is not appropriate for this patient. Option D (perform a second lacrimal gland biopsy) is the next step in this patient's management.

Explanation:
The correct answer is B. Perform orbitotomy with excision. The patient in the case has a hidden globe, which is a condition in which the eye is not visible in the orbit. This can be caused by a number of conditions, including microphthalmia, anophthalmia, and orbital cysts. In this case, the patient has a right orbital cyst that is displacing the microphthalmic globe superiorly. The treatment for a hidden globe is surgical excision of the cyst. This can be done through an orbitotomy, which is an incision made into the orbit. The cyst is then removed and the orbit is repaired.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A, perform aspiration, is incorrect because aspiration is not a definitive treatment for a hidden globe. The cyst would likely recur after aspiration.
* Option C, administer radiotherapy, is incorrect because radiotherapy is not a first-line treatment for a hidden globe. Radiotherapy can be used to shrink the cyst, but it is not curative.
* Option D, administer intralesional corticosteroids, is incorrect because intralesional corticosteroids are not a definitive treatment for a hidden globe. Corticosteroids can be used to reduce inflammation, but they are not curative.

The patient has a history of handling a bloody raccoon carcass without gloves. This suggests that he may have been exposed to Bartonella henselae or Francisella tularensis, both of which can cause conjunctivitis. Conjunctival cultures are not likely to be helpful in this case, as they are often negative in patients with these infections. Serologic testing is the most sensitive way to diagnose these infections.

Repeated computed tomography of orbits with contrast is not necessary in this case, as the patient does not have any signs or symptoms of orbital cellulitis.

Reassurance that the diagnosis is typically self-limited is not appropriate in this case, as the patient has a history of exposure to Bartonella henselae or Francisella tularensis, both of which can cause serious infections.

Indocyanine green angiography (ICG) and fluorescein angiography (FA) are both useful in the diagnosis and management of macular hemorrhage. ICG is particularly useful in the evaluation of choroidal neovascularization (CNV), while FA is more useful in the evaluation of retinal vascular abnormalities. In this case, the patient has a submacular hemorrhage with pigment epithelial detachment, which could be caused by a variety of conditions, including CNV. Both ICG and FA would be helpful in determining the cause of the hemorrhage and in planning treatment.

Computed tomography (CT) of the brain is not necessary in this case, as there is no evidence of intracranial pathology. B-scan ultrasonography and autofluorescence are not as sensitive as ICG or FA in the evaluation of macular hemorrhage.

Therefore, the best next step in this case is to perform ICG and FA.

The patient's presentation is consistent with acute retinal necrosis (ARN), a severe retinal vasculitis caused by varicella-zoster virus (VZV). The most common presenting symptoms of ARN are sudden, painless loss of vision in one eye, followed by pain and redness in the eye. On examination, patients with ARN typically have conjunctival hyperemia, anterior chamber inflammation, vitritis, and retinal vasculitis. Fluorescein angiography can show late vascular leakage and peripheral ischemia.

The gold standard for diagnosis of ARN is a positive viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test on aqueous humor. Aqueous humor can be obtained by needle aspirate or vitreous biopsy. Once the diagnosis of ARN is confirmed, treatment should be initiated with intravitreal and systemic antiviral therapy. Intravitreal ganciclovir is the most commonly used antiviral agent for ARN. Systemic antiviral therapy with acyclovir or valacyclovir is also recommended.

Early diagnosis and treatment of ARN are essential to prevent vision loss. With prompt treatment, most patients with ARN will recover good vision. However, some patients may experience permanent vision loss, especially if treatment is delayed.

The other answers are incorrect because they are not the standard of care for ARN. A lumbar puncture is not necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of ARN. A pars plana vitrectomy is a surgical procedure that is not routinely performed for ARN.

The patient has a chronic retinal detachment with persistent subretinal fluid and a small area of fibrotic tissue contraction consistent with early proliferative vitreoretinopathy. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). PVR is a serious complication of retinal detachment that can lead to permanent vision loss.

The goal of treatment for PVR is to reattach the retina and prevent further retinal detachment. This is typically done with a combination of vitrectomy and laser photocoagulation. Vitrectomy is a surgical procedure in which the vitreous gel is removed from the eye. This allows the surgeon to access the retina and perform laser photocoagulation. Laser photocoagulation is a procedure in which laser light is used to create scars on the retina. These scars help to prevent the retina from detaching again.

In this case, the patient has a small area of PVR. This suggests that early intervention with vitrectomy and laser photocoagulation is likely to be successful in reattaching the retina and preventing further retinal detachment. Therefore, the best course of treatment is to perform pars plana vitrectomy with endolaser.

The other options are not as appropriate in this case. Option A, observing the patient, is not a good option because the patient has a chronic retinal detachment with persistent subretinal fluid. This suggests that the patient is at high risk for further retinal detachment and vision loss. Option B, administering intravitreal corticosteroid injection, is not a good option because corticosteroids can actually worsen PVR. Option C, performing laser photocoagulation, is not a good option because laser photocoagulation alone is not likely to be successful in reattaching the retina in this case.

 44%|████▍     | 672/1525 [2:34:40<3:18:54, 13.99s/it]The correct answer is C. Leukemia cutis.

Leukemia cutis is a skin manifestation of leukemia, a type of cancer of the blood cells. It is characterized by the presence of leukemia cells in the skin. Leukemia cutis can occur in patients with any type of leukemia, but it is most common in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

The skin lesions of leukemia cutis can vary in appearance, but they are often red, purple, or black. They may be flat or raised, and they may be painful or itchy. The lesions may also bleed or ooze.

The diagnosis of leukemia cutis is made by biopsy of the skin lesion. The biopsy will show the presence of leukemia cells in the skin.

There is no cure for leukemia cutis, but it can be treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The treatment for leukemia cutis is aimed at controlling the underlying leukemia.

The prognosis for patients with leukemia cutis depends on the type of leukemia and the stage of the disease. Patients with ALL who have leukemia cutis have a poorer prognosis than patients with ALL who do not have leukemia cutis.

A: Brown recluse envenomation is a skin infection caused by the bite of a brown recluse spider. The bite of a brown recluse spider can cause a variety of symptoms, including a red, swollen area at the site of the bite, fever, chills, and nausea. In some cases, the bite of a brown recluse spider can also cause a necrotic skin lesion, also known as a "flesh-eating" ulcer. However, the skin lesion in the case presented is not consistent with a brown recluse envenomation. The skin lesion is not red and swollen, and there is no evidence of necrosis.

B: Pyoderma gangrenosum is a skin condition that can cause painful, ulcerating lesions. Pyoderma gangrenosum is often associated with underlying medical conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and leukemia. However, the skin lesion in the case presented is not consistent with pyoderma gangrenosum. The skin lesion is not painful, and there is no evidence of ulceration.

D: Mucormycosis is a fungal infection that can affect the skin, lungs, and other organs. Mucormycosis is most common in people who are immunocompromised, such as patients with cancer or diabetes. The skin lesions of mucormycosis are often black and necrotic. However, the skin lesion in the case presented is not consistent with mucormycosis. The skin lesion is not black or necrotic.

Right heart catheterization is the most accurate way to measure the pressure in the right atrium and right ventricle, and to assess the function of the tricuspid valve. This information is essential to determine the cause of the patient's dyspnea and edema, and to guide treatment.

Fluoroscopy is a type of X-ray that can be used to visualize the heart and lungs. However, it cannot provide the same level of information as right heart catheterization.

Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is a type of CT scan that can be used to visualize the blood vessels in the lungs. However, it cannot provide the same level of information as right heart catheterization about the pressure in the right atrium and right ventricle, or the function of the tricuspid valve.

Coronary angiography is a type of X-ray that can be used to visualize the blood vessels that supply blood to the heart. However, it is not necessary in this case, as the patient's dyspnea and edema are not caused by coronary artery disease.

The aPTT is a test that measures how long it takes for blood to clot. The PT is a test that measures how long it takes for blood to clot when a certain factor is added to it. Rivaroxaban is a direct oral anticoagulant that works by inhibiting factor Xa. This means that it can prolong both the aPTT and the PT.

In this case, the patient's PT is abnormal, which suggests that he is still being affected by the rivaroxaban. This means that his hemostatic status is not appropriate for surgery, as he is at increased risk of bleeding.

The thrombin clotting time and the INR are other tests that can be used to assess hemostasis. However, in this case, the PT is the most important test to consider, as it is the most sensitive test for the effects of rivaroxaban.

The patient has a 3.1-cm left adrenal mass, which is concerning for a pheochromocytoma or an adrenal adenoma. Pheochromocytomas are rare, catecholamine-secreting tumors that arise from the adrenal medulla. Adrenal adenomas are more common, non-functioning tumors that arise from the adrenal cortex. Both pheochromocytomas and adrenal adenomas can cause hypertension, but pheochromocytomas also cause symptoms such as headache, palpitations, and sweating.

The patient in this case does not have any symptoms suggestive of a pheochromocytoma, but his hypertension is poorly controlled. In addition, he has a history of type 2 diabetes, which is a risk factor for adrenal adenomas. Therefore, it is reasonable to perform further evaluation for subclinical hypercortisolism, which is a state of mild hypercortisolemia that is not associated with any symptoms.

Subclinical hypercortisolism can be diagnosed with a 24-hour urine measurement of free cortisol or a low-dose dexamethasone suppression test. If the patient is found to have subclinical hypercortisolism, he should be evaluated for an adrenal adenoma.

The other answers are incorrect because they do not address the patient's underlying concern, which is a possible adrenal mass. Answer A would be incorrect because it would not rule out the possibility of a pheochromocytoma or an adrenal adenoma. Answer B would be incorrect because it would not help to determine whether the patient has subclinical hypercortisolism. Answer C would be incorrect because it would not help to determine whether the patient has a pheochromocytoma or an adrenal adenoma.

Explanation:
The patient is an elderly woman with a history of pneumonia who presents with painful buttock and vulvar ulcers. She is not sexually active and has no medical history of sexually transmitted infections. The ulcers are tender to palpation and the patient has leukopenia. A biopsy specimen from the left vulvar ulcer shows cytomegalovirus (CMV) inclusions. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of CMV ulcers.

Fixed drug eruption is a type of skin rash that occurs after exposure to a certain medication. It is characterized by round or oval lesions that are often painful and itchy. The lesions typically resolve within a few weeks after the medication is stopped.

Cutaneous candidiasis is a fungal infection of the skin. It is most common in people who are immunocompromised, such as those with HIV/AIDS or cancer. The infection can cause white, flaky patches on the skin, especially in moist areas such as the groin, armpits, and under the breasts.

Genital herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is a sexually transmitted infection that can cause painful blisters on the genitals. The blisters typically heal within a few weeks, but the virus can remain dormant in the body and cause recurrent infections.

In this case, the patient's history and physical examination findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of CMV ulcers. The patient is an elderly woman with a history of pneumonia, which is a risk factor for CMV infection. The ulcers are tender to palpation and the patient has leukopenia, which are both common findings in CMV infection. The biopsy specimen from the left vulvar ulcer shows CMV inclusions, which is diagnostic of CMV infection.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely in this case. Fixed drug eruption is typically seen in younger people and is not associated with leukopenia. Cutaneous candidiasis is more common in people who are immunocompromised and does not typically cause ulcers. Genital HSV infection is a sexually transmitted infection and the patient has no history of sexual activity.

Explanation:
CCLE is a chronic, autoimmune inflammatory skin disease that is characterized by the presence of erythematous, scaly plaques on the face, scalp, and other sun-exposed areas. The lesions of CCLE are often precipitated by sun exposure, and they may be associated with other symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus, such as fever, fatigue, and joint pain.

The patient in the case presentation presents with a 2-year history of asymptomatic, facial redness that flares in sunlight. She had been previously treated with doxycycline, 100 mg/d, and topical sulfacetamide with no effect. On examination, there were multiple erythematous, annular plaques with focal areas of atrophy on the cheeks and nasal bridge. Her medications included only an oral birth control pill. Serum chemical analyses and complete blood cell count showed no abnormalities, and anti-Ro, anti-La, and qualitative ANA antibodies were negative. A clinical diagnosis of CCLE was made, and over the next 9 months, treatments with minocycline, desonide, topical metronidazole, 0.75%, cream and azelaic acid, 15%, were unsuccessful, and the plaques developed more scarring and atrophy. In addition, the patient began to develop a burning sensation in these areas. A punch biopsy specimen was obtained and submitted for histopathologic review, which showed features consistent with CCLE.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's presentation in a comprehensive manner.

Granuloma faciale is a rare, benign, chronic inflammatory skin disease that is characterized by the presence of one or more erythematous, papular, or nodular lesions on the face. The lesions of granuloma faciale are often associated with pruritus and tenderness, and they may be precipitated by sun exposure. However, the patient in the case presentation does not have any history of granuloma faciale, and the lesions on her face are not associated with pruritus or tenderness. Additionally, granuloma faciale is not typically associated with scarring or atrophy.

Neutrophilic sebaceous adenitis is a rare, inflammatory skin disease that is characterized by the presence of erythematous, papular, or nodular lesions on the face, scalp, and other sebaceous-rich areas. The lesions of neutrophilic sebaceous adenitis are often associated with pruritus, pain, and tenderness, and they may be precipitated by sun exposure. However, the patient in the case presentation does not have any history of neutrophilic sebaceous adenitis, and the lesions on her face are not associated with pruritus, pain, or tenderness. Additionally, neutrophilic sebaceous adenitis is not typically associated with scarring or atrophy.

Rosacea-like dermatitis is a chronic, inflammatory skin disease that is characterized by the presence of erythematous, papular, or pustular lesions on the face. The lesions of rosacea-like dermatitis are often associated with flushing, burning, and stinging, and they may be precipitated by sun exposure. However, the patient in the case presentation does not have any history of rosacea-like dermatitis, and the lesions on her face are not associated with flushing, burning, or stinging. Additionally, rosacea-like dermatitis is not typically associated with scarring or atrophy.

Explanation:

Annular erythema of infancy (AEI) is a common, benign skin eruption that typically occurs in infants and young children. It is characterized by annular or serpiginous erythematous plaques with central clearing. The lesions are usually asymptomatic, but some patients may experience mild itching. The eruption typically resolves spontaneously within a few weeks or months.

The diagnosis of AEI is made clinically. There is no specific laboratory test or biopsy finding that is diagnostic. In some cases, a skin biopsy may be performed to rule out other possible causes of annular erythema, such as tinea corporis, erythema marginatum, or Lyme disease.

The treatment of AEI is generally not necessary. In some cases, topical corticosteroids or oral antihistamines may be used to relieve itching.

The prognosis of AEI is excellent. The eruption typically resolves spontaneously within a few weeks or months.

The following are the reasons why the other options are incorrect:

* Tinea corporis is a fungal infection that can cause annular or serpiginous erythematous plaques with central clearing. However, tinea corporis is usually associated with scaling, which is not present in this case. Additionally, tinea corporis is usually pruritic, which is not always the case in AEI.
* Erythema marginatum is a rash that is associated with rheumatic fever. It is characterized by annular or serpiginous erythematous plaques with central clearing. However, erythema marginatum is usually associated with fever, arthralgia, and other systemic symptoms, which are not present in this case.
* Lyme disease is an infection caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi. It can cause an erythema migrans rash, which is characterized by a large, expanding annular erythematous plaque with central clearing. However, Lyme disease is usually associated with other symptoms, such as fever, headache, and fatigue, which are not present in this case.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is AEI.

Exposure and response prevention (ERP) is the gold standard treatment for OCD. It is a type of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) that involves gradually exposing yourself to the things that you are afraid of and then preventing yourself from performing the compulsions that you usually do to try to make yourself feel better. ERP can be very effective in reducing OCD symptoms.

In the case of this patient, she has already tried several different medications without success. ERP is a non-medication treatment that has been shown to be effective in treating OCD, even in cases that have not responded to medication. Therefore, referral for outpatient ERP would be the most appropriate next step in her treatment.

Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and deep brain stimulation (DBS) are both newer treatments for OCD that are still being studied. TMS involves using a magnetic field to stimulate nerve cells in the brain. DBS involves implanting electrodes in the brain to deliver electrical stimulation to specific areas. Both TMS and DBS have shown some promise in treating OCD, but they are not yet considered to be first-line treatments.

Pharmacotherapy with memantine augmentation of SSRI is a treatment option that has been shown to be effective in treating OCD in some cases. However, it is important to note that memantine is not approved by the FDA for the treatment of OCD. Additionally, memantine can have side effects, such as dizziness, headache, and fatigue.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in the treatment of this patient is referral for outpatient ERP.

Wernicke encephalopathy is a neurological disorder that is caused by a deficiency of thiamine (vitamin B1). It is characterized by confusion, ataxia, and nystagmus. The patient in the case does not have any symptoms of Wernicke encephalopathy.

Miller Fisher variant of Guillain-Barre syndrome is a rare neurological disorder that is characterized by ataxia, areflexia, and ophthalmoplegia. The patient in the case does have ataxia and ophthalmoplegia, but she does not have areflexia.

Anti-Ma2 encephalitis is an autoimmune disorder that affects the brain. It is characterized by encephalitis, which is inflammation of the brain. The patient in the case does have encephalitis, as evidenced by her cognitive changes, gait instability, and seizures. Additionally, the brain MRI shows T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery hyperintensities in the right thalamus, inferior temporal gyrus, and hippocampus, which are findings that are consistent with anti-Ma2 encephalitis.

Explanation:

Bronchopulmonary sequestration (BPS) is a congenital anomaly of the lung characterized by a non-functioning, non-ventilated, non-aerated mass of lung tissue that is supplied by systemic blood vessels. It is usually located in the lower lobe of the lung and is often associated with a pleural effusion.

The most common presentation of BPS is respiratory distress in the neonatal period. Other symptoms may include cyanosis, tachypnea, and feeding difficulties. On physical examination, the patient may have a chest mass and decreased breath sounds on the affected side.

The diagnosis of BPS is made with imaging studies, such as chest radiography, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). CT is the most accurate imaging modality for diagnosing BPS. It shows a well-defined, non-enhancing mass of lung tissue that is supplied by a systemic artery.

The treatment of BPS is surgical resection. The goal of surgery is to remove the sequestrated lung tissue and to repair any associated pleural effusion. Surgery is usually performed in the neonatal period or early infancy.

The prognosis for patients with BPS is good. With early diagnosis and treatment, the majority of patients have a good long-term outcome.

The other options are incorrect because they are not congenital anomalies of the lung. Teratoma is a germ cell tumor that can occur in any part of the body, including the lung. Carcinoma is a malignant tumor of the lung. Congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM) is a developmental anomaly of the lung that is characterized by abnormal airways and cysts.

 45%|████▍     | 682/1525 [2:36:46<3:06:23, 13.27s/it]The correct answer is B: Shave biopsy of lesion.

The patient has a 6.5-mm area of left lower eyelid margin thinning associated with surrounding misdirected eyelashes and central madarosis, as well as meibomian orifice effacement and overlying telangiectatic vessels. These findings are suspicious for basal cell carcinoma, a type of skin cancer. A shave biopsy is the most appropriate procedure to diagnose this condition. A shave biopsy involves removing a small piece of tissue from the lesion with a scalpel. The tissue is then sent to a pathologist to be examined under a microscope. A shave biopsy is a relatively simple procedure that can be performed in an office setting. It is usually performed under local anesthesia. The patient may experience some discomfort after the procedure, but this usually resolves within a few days. A shave biopsy is a very accurate way to diagnose basal cell carcinoma. If the biopsy results are positive, the patient will need to have further treatment, such as surgery or radiation therapy.

The other options are incorrect. Clinical observation is not an appropriate management for a suspicious eyelid lesion. A wedge biopsy is a more invasive procedure than a shave biopsy. It is not necessary to perform a wedge biopsy in this case because a shave biopsy is sufficient to diagnose the condition. Epilting the misdirected lashes is not an appropriate management for a suspicious eyelid lesion. This procedure would not remove the underlying lesion and would not provide a diagnosis.

The patient has bilateral optic nerve edema with disc hemorrhages and peripheral retinal whitening. On extended ophthalmoscopy, subtle areas of granular retinal whitening were noted in the peripheral retina. No vitritis was appreciable. Fluorescein angiography exhibited disc hyperfluorescence and late peripheral staining in both eyes. Optical coherence tomography demonstrated thickening of the papillary nerve fiber layer. Automated perimetry demonstrated bilateral enlargement of the physiological blind spot and bilateral arcuate scotomas, greater in the right eye.

The most likely diagnosis is posterior uveitis due to Candida glabrata. Candida glabrata is a yeast that is commonly found in the mouth, throat, and gastrointestinal tract. It can also be found in the vagina and on the skin. Candida glabrata can cause a variety of infections, including urinary tract infections, pneumonia, and candidemia. It can also cause eye infections, such as posterior uveitis.

Posterior uveitis is an inflammation of the uvea, which is the middle layer of the eye. The uvea includes the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. Posterior uveitis can cause a variety of symptoms, including blurred vision, floaters, pain, and redness in the eye.

The treatment for posterior uveitis due to Candida glabrata is usually with antifungal medication. The most commonly used antifungal medication for this condition is foscarnet sodium. Foscarnet sodium is a medication that is injected into the eye. It is effective against a variety of fungal infections, including Candida glabrata.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Intravitreal injection of amphotericin B is not the best treatment for posterior uveitis due to Candida glabrata. Amphotericin B is an antifungal medication that is also injected into the eye. However, it is not as effective against Candida glabrata as foscarnet sodium.
* Diagnostic anterior chamber paracentesis is not a treatment for posterior uveitis. Diagnostic anterior chamber paracentesis is a procedure that is used to collect fluid from the front chamber of the eye. This fluid can then be tested to determine the cause of the inflammation.
* Diagnostic vitrectomy is not a treatment for posterior uveitis. Diagnostic vitrectomy is a procedure that is used to remove vitreous humor from the eye. Vitreous humor is a gel-like substance that fills the inside of the eye. This procedure is used to diagnose and treat a variety of eye conditions, but it is not used to treat posterior uveitis.
* Stereotactic radiation therapy to the optic nerve is not a treatment for posterior uveitis. Stereotactic radiation therapy is a type of radiation therapy that is used to treat cancer. It is not used to treat posterior uveitis.

The patient in the case report has a number of features that are concerning for Graves' disease, including ptosis, proptosis, and extraocular muscle restriction. Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes inflammation of the thyroid gland, which can lead to a number of eye problems, including proptosis, ptosis, and extraocular muscle restriction.

MRI is the best imaging modality for evaluating the orbits in patients with Graves' disease. MRI can provide detailed images of the soft tissues of the orbit, including the thyroid gland, extraocular muscles, and optic nerve. This information can be used to diagnose Graves' disease and to assess the severity of the eye problems.

Serologic workup, chest CT, and observation are not appropriate next steps in this patient. Serologic workup can be used to screen for Graves' disease, but it is not necessary in this patient because the clinical presentation is highly suggestive of the diagnosis. Chest CT is not necessary to evaluate the orbits in this patient. Observation is not appropriate because the patient has significant eye problems that require treatment.

Therefore, the correct answer is A: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits with and without contrast.

Explanation:

The most likely cause of shallowing of the anterior chamber in this case is hypotony, which can be caused by a number of factors, including excessive aqueous humor drainage, inadequate aqueous humor production, or a combination of both. In this case, the patient has a corneal opacity that precludes an accurate assessment of the chamber depth and stability. Therefore, the first step is to inflate the anterior chamber with an ophthalmic viscosurgical device (OVD) to create a temporary tamponade and allow for better visualization of the chamber. Once the chamber is adequately inflated, the surgeon can then assess the depth and stability of the chamber and determine the appropriate course of treatment.

Applying fibrin glue to all surgical wounds would not be the most appropriate next step in this case, as it would not address the underlying cause of the shallowing of the anterior chamber. Injecting a sterile air bubble would also not be the most appropriate next step, as it would not provide a long-term solution to the problem. Tilting the microscope for better visualization of the anterior chamber would be helpful, but it would not address the underlying cause of the shallowing of the anterior chamber.

The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy. Hydroxychloroquine is a medication used to treat a variety of autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis. It can cause a number of ocular side effects, including retinopathy, which is a condition that affects the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. Retinopathy can cause a variety of visual symptoms, including blurred vision, decreased vision, and central scotomas (blind spots).

The electroretinogram (ERG) is a test that measures the electrical activity of the retina in response to light. The multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG) is a more sensitive test that measures the electrical activity of the retina in response to small spots of light. Both tests can be used to diagnose and monitor hydroxychloroquine retinopathy.

In this case, the patient's ERG and mfERG are likely to be abnormal, which would confirm the diagnosis of hydroxychloroquine retinopathy. The patient should be advised to stop taking hydroxychloroquine and to see an ophthalmologist for further management.

A lumbar puncture is not necessary in this case, as there is no evidence of an infectious process. Spinal cord imaging is also not necessary, as there is no evidence of neuromyelitis optica.

The patient is a 54-year-old Cambodian woman who presented with a left orbital mass that had been incidentally found on computed tomography for sinusitis. She was asymptomatic except for 2 years of progressive, painless, left-sided proptosis. Her physical examination findings were unremarkable except for resistance to retropulsion of the left globe and 5 mm of left-sided proptosis by Hertel exophthalmometry. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a superonasal orbital mass that was T1 isointense to brain parenchyma and heterogeneously T2 hyperintense, with a small cystic component and avid peripheral contrast enhancement. Bony remodeling without destruction was noted, as well as displacement of the superior oblique and superior rectus muscles. The interpreting radiologist thought that the mass did not have the typical appearance of a vascular malformation or of a schwannoma and that other neoplastic and chronic infectious causes, including a parasitic origin, should be considered.

The next best step in management is to observe and perform another MRI in 6 months. This is because the mass is small, asymptomatic, and does not have the typical appearance of a malignancy. Additionally, the patient is at increased risk for complications from surgery, such as infection and vision loss. Therefore, it is reasonable to observe the mass and repeat imaging in 6 months to see if it is growing or changing in any way. If the mass is growing or changing, then further management, such as biopsy or surgery, may be necessary.

Empirical treatment with an antiparasitic agent is not recommended at this time because the mass does not have the typical appearance of a parasitic infection. Additionally, there is a risk of side effects from antiparasitic agents, so it is important to only use them when there is a clear indication.

Performing a biopsy of the mass is also not recommended at this time because the mass is small and asymptomatic. Additionally, there is a risk of complications from biopsy, such as infection and bleeding. Therefore, it is reasonable to observe the mass and repeat imaging in 6 months to see if it is growing or changing in any way. If the mass is growing or changing, then further management, such as biopsy or surgery, may be necessary.

Performing whole-body positron emission tomography (PET) is not recommended at this time because the mass is small and asymptomatic. Additionally, there is a risk of radiation exposure from PET. Therefore, it is reasonable to observe the mass and repeat imaging in 6 months to see if it is growing or changing in any way. If the mass is growing or changing, then further management, such as biopsy or surgery, may be necessary.

The patient is a teenage girl with a 3-month history of a growing, painless mass in the right thigh. The mass was inhomogeneous on MRI and was confirmed to be a Ewing sarcoma by biopsy. Ewing sarcoma is a rare, aggressive soft tissue sarcoma that most commonly affects children and adolescents. It is a small round cell tumor that is positive for the EWS-FLI1 fusion gene.

The patient then underwent disease staging with CT of the chest and whole-body FDG-PET. The CT findings were negative for secondary lesions; the FDG-PET scan demonstrated, as expected, high uptake in the right thigh (maximum standard uptake variable [SUVmax], 8.4) at the site of the subcutaneous tumor and at a second lesion in the left ankle joint (SUVmax, 12.0). This finding is consistent with metastasis of Ewing sarcoma to the ankle joint.

Ganglion cysts are benign, fluid-filled cysts that most commonly occur in the hands and feet. They are usually asymptomatic and do not require treatment. Tenosynovial giant cell tumors are rare, benign tumors that arise from the synovium, the membrane that lines joint capsules and tendon sheaths. They are usually painful and can cause swelling and deformity. Synovial sarcomas are rare, malignant tumors that arise from the synovium. They are more common in adults than in children and adolescents.

In conclusion, the patient's history, physical examination, imaging findings, and biopsy results are most consistent with a diagnosis of Ewing sarcoma. The presence of metastasis to the ankle joint is also consistent with this diagnosis.

 45%|████▌     | 689/1525 [2:38:07<2:55:30, 12.60s/it]The correct answer is D: Pursue urgent valve replacement.

The patient has developed bioprosthetic aortic stenosis with a mean gradient of 29 mm Hg, which is severe and requires urgent intervention. The 4-D CT angiography shows nodular filling defects along all of the leaflets with restricted excursion, which is consistent with a diagnosis of bioprosthetic valve thrombosis. Bioprosthetic valve thrombosis is a serious complication of TAVR that can lead to death if not treated promptly. The treatment of choice is urgent valve replacement, which can be performed either surgically or percutaneously.

A: Obtain blood culture samples and administer combination cefazolin, rifampin, and gentamicin is incorrect because this is the treatment for infective endocarditis, which is not the diagnosis in this case.

B: Administer unfractioned heparin and bridge to warfarin is incorrect because this is the treatment for acute coronary syndrome, which is also not the diagnosis in this case.

C: Increase the aspirin dosage to 325 mg daily, discontinue clopidogrel, and administer ticagrelor is incorrect because this is the treatment for acute coronary syndrome, which is also not the diagnosis in this case.

 45%|████▌     | 690/1525 [2:38:18<2:48:54, 12.14s/it]Answer: D. Solitary fibrous tumor
Explanation:
The patient in the case presented with a slow-growing, non-painful mass in the parapharyngeal space. The mass was well-circumscribed and had a paucicellular spindle cell neoplasm with abundant myxocollagenous matrix. The scattered tumor cells were spindled to stellate shaped and had the morphology of myofibroblasts. Rare vessels were identified, and the tumors focally infiltrated subcutaneous fat and skeletal muscle.

The differential diagnosis for a slow-growing, non-painful mass in the parapharyngeal space includes desmoid-type fibromatosis, neurofibroma, collagenous fibroma, and solitary fibrous tumor. Desmoid-type fibromatosis is a rare, locally aggressive fibromatosis that typically occurs in the extremities. Neurofibroma is a benign tumor of peripheral nerve origin. Collagenous fibroma is a rare, benign fibroma that typically occurs in the skin. Solitary fibrous tumor is a rare, benign tumor that can occur in any location, but is most common in the chest and abdomen.

The patient in the case presented with a mass that was well-circumscribed and had a paucicellular spindle cell neoplasm with abundant myxocollagenous matrix. The scattered tumor cells were spindled to stellate shaped and had the morphology of myofibroblasts. Rare vessels were identified, and the tumors focally infiltrated subcutaneous fat and skeletal muscle. These findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of solitary fibrous tumor.

Desmoid-type fibromatosis is a rare, locally aggressive fibromatosis that typically occurs in the extremities. Desmoid-type fibromatosis is characterized by a dense, collagenous stroma with spindle cells. The tumor cells are typically bland and have a low mitotic rate. Desmoid-type fibromatosis is not associated with myxocollagenous matrix or myofibroblasts.

Neurofibroma is a benign tumor of peripheral nerve origin. Neurofibromas are characterized by a proliferation of Schwann cells and perineural fibroblasts. The tumor cells are typically bland and have a low mitotic rate. Neurofibromas are not associated with myxocollagenous matrix or myofibroblasts.

Collagenous fibroma is a rare, benign fibroma that typically occurs in the skin. Collagenous fibromas are characterized by a dense, collagenous stroma with few or no tumor cells. The tumor cells are typically bland and have a low mitotic rate. Collagenous fibromas are not associated with myxocollagenous matrix or myofibroblasts.

Solitary fibrous tumor is a rare, benign tumor that can occur in any location, but is most common in the chest and abdomen. Solitary fibrous tumors are characterized by a spindle cell proliferation with abundant myxocollagenous matrix. The tumor cells are typically bland and have a low mitotic rate. Solitary fibrous tumors are often associated with mast cells.

In conclusion, the patient in the case presented with a slow-growing, non-painful mass in the parapharyngeal space. The mass was well-circumscribed and had a paucicellular spindle cell neoplasm with abundant myxocollagenous matrix. The scattered tumor cells were spindled to stellate shaped and had the morphology of myofibroblasts. Rare vessels were identified, and the tumors focally infiltrated subcutaneous fat and skeletal muscle. These findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of solitary fibrous tumor.

 45%|████▌     | 691/1525 [2:38:35<3:06:21, 13.41s/it]Answer: C
Explanation:
The patient has a long history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) with persistent symptoms despite medical therapy. The EGD showed normal esophageal mucosa and biopsies, which makes Barrett's esophagus an unlikely diagnosis. The HRM study showed a hypotensive lower esophageal sphincter (LES), which is consistent with GERD. Given the patient's persistent symptoms and the HRM findings, the next step in management is to increase the omeprazole dosing to twice daily. A 360-degree (Nissen) fundoplication or esophageal (Heller) myotomy and partial fundoplication are surgical options that may be considered if medical therapy is not effective. However, these procedures are associated with risks and should only be considered after careful discussion with the patient. Replacing omeprazole with nortriptyline is not a reasonable option in this case, as nortriptyline is not a first-line therapy for GERD.

 45%|████▌     | 692/1525 [2:38:45<2:51:39, 12.36s/it]The answer is A. Fournier gangrene.

Fournier gangrene is a rapidly progressive necrotizing infection of the perineum and surrounding areas. It is most commonly caused by polymicrobial infection, with Escherichia coli, Bacteroides fragilis, and Enterococcus faecalis being the most common organisms isolated. Fournier gangrene is a medical emergency and requires prompt diagnosis and treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics and surgical debridement.

The patient in the case presented with a rapidly progressive, painful anogenital ulcer. The lesion had developed acutely over 48 hours, starting as symmetric pink patches leading to pustules, erosions, and ulceration. Associated symptoms included generalized fatigue, but no fevers, chills, or other systemic symptoms. The child’s parents denied any new topical exposures or medications. The physical examination revealed a well-appearing infant with normal vital signs. Extending from the gluteal cleft to just medial to the scrotum, there was a symmetric, well-defined ulcer with a cribriform base, central necrosis, and rolled, pink-to-violaceous, undermined border. Initial laboratory workup was significant for leukocytosis (22 000/mm3) and thrombocytosis (764 000/mm3). Serum zinc and alkaline phosphatase were within normal limits. A punch biopsy of the edge of the ulcer was obtained and stained with hematoxylin-eosin. Microbial stains were negative. Tissue cultures for anaerobic and/or aerobic, mycobacterial, and fungal organisms were all negative, though wound cultures grew Escherichia coli, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Enterococcus faecalis. Viral cultures were negative.

The clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and histopathology findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of Fournier gangrene. The patient was treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics and surgical debridement. The patient made a good recovery and was discharged from the hospital after 10 days of treatment.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Pyoderma gangrenosum is a neutrophilic dermatosis that can occur in a variety of settings, including inflammatory bowel disease, hematologic malignancies, and autoimmune diseases. It is typically characterized by painful, necrotic ulcers that can be extensive. The patient in the case presented did not have any of the underlying conditions that are associated with pyoderma gangrenosum.
* Severe irritant contact dermatitis (chemical burn) is a type of dermatitis that is caused by exposure to a chemical irritant. It is typically characterized by erythema, edema, and vesiculation. The patient in the case presented did not have any history of exposure to a chemical irritant.
* Acquired acrodermatitis enteropathica is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder of zinc metabolism. It is characterized by skin lesions, alopecia, and diarrhea. The patient in the case presented did not have any of the characteristic skin lesions or alopecia of acquired acrodermatitis enteropathica.

 45%|████▌     | 693/1525 [2:39:01<3:07:56, 13.55s/it]Answer: D. Sarcoidosis

Explanation:
Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disease of unknown etiology characterized by noncaseating granulomas in affected tissues. It can affect any organ system, but the lungs are most commonly involved. The skin is the second most common organ system involved, and cutaneous sarcoidosis can present in a variety of ways. The most common presentation is of erythematous papules or nodules, often on the face, upper extremities, and trunk. Other possible presentations include plaques, ulcers, and livedo reticularis.

The patient in the case presentation has a history of disseminated dermatosis involving the trunk and limbs. The lesions are polymorphic, erythematous, and indurated. They do not evanesce to pressure, which suggests that they are not urticarial vasculitis. The patient also has dysesthesia, which is a common symptom of sarcoidosis.

The histopathological findings are consistent with sarcoidosis. The biopsy specimen shows a chronic dermic granulomatous process with a perineural distribution. This is a characteristic finding of sarcoidosis.

The other possible diagnoses are not as likely in this case. Borderline-borderline leprosy is a form of leprosy that is characterized by hypopigmented macules and papules. Mycosis fungoides is a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that typically presents with patches or plaques of erythema. Disseminated annular granuloma is a rare disorder of unknown etiology characterized by annular or serpiginous lesions on the skin.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for the patient in the case presentation is sarcoidosis. The clinical presentation, histopathological findings, and lack of other systemic symptoms support this diagnosis.

Explanation:

The patient has a linear Blaschkoid pattern of reddish keratotic papules and plaques on her right forearm and dorsal hand. This is the classic presentation of epidermal nevus. Epidermal nevi are congenital hamartomas of the epidermis that can present with a variety of clinical features, including hyperkeratosis, papillomatosis, and hypopigmentation. They are often associated with other congenital anomalies, such as skeletal and cardiac defects. The diagnosis of epidermal nevus is made clinically and confirmed by skin biopsy. Treatment is generally not necessary, but surgical excision may be considered for cosmetic or functional reasons.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Linear porokeratosis is a rare, acquired disorder characterized by linear or serpiginous plaques of hyperkeratosis. It is not associated with a Blaschkoid pattern.
* Porokeratotic eccrine ostial and dermal duct nevus is a rare, congenital disorder characterized by linear or whorled plaques of hyperkeratosis with prominent eccrine ducts. It is not associated with a Blaschkoid pattern.

 46%|████▌     | 695/1525 [2:39:32<3:22:00, 14.60s/it]The correct answer is: **A: Thyroid eye disease.**

Explanation:

The patient in this case presents with a number of symptoms that are consistent with thyroid eye disease, also known as Graves' orbitopathy. These symptoms include:

* Proptosis, or bulging of the eyes
* Ptosis, or drooping of the eyelids
* Ophthalmoparesis, or weakness of the eye muscles
* Diplopia, or double vision
* Periorbital swelling

Thyroid eye disease is an autoimmune disorder that occurs when the body's immune system attacks the tissues around the eyes. This can lead to inflammation, swelling, and pressure on the optic nerve and other structures in the eye.

The symptoms of thyroid eye disease can vary from person to person. Some people may only experience mild symptoms, while others may have more severe symptoms that can interfere with their vision and daily activities.

There is no cure for thyroid eye disease, but there are treatments that can help to relieve the symptoms. Treatment may include medications, surgery, or a combination of both.

In the case of the patient in this case, the symptoms suggest that he is experiencing a mild to moderate case of thyroid eye disease. The treatment for his condition will likely include medications to reduce inflammation and swelling, as well as eye exercises to help improve his vision. He may also need surgery to correct his proptosis and ptosis.

The other possible diagnoses listed in the question are all less likely in this case. Cavernous sinus syndrome is a rare disorder that occurs when the cavernous sinus, a large vein that runs through the skull, becomes inflamed. This can cause a variety of symptoms, including double vision, facial numbness, and headache. However, cavernous sinus syndrome is usually not associated with proptosis or ptosis.

Orbital apex syndrome is a more common disorder that occurs when the optic nerve and other structures at the back of the eye become compressed. This can cause a variety of symptoms, including double vision, headache, and vision loss. However, orbital apex syndrome is usually not associated with proptosis or ptosis.

Orbital cellulitis is an infection of the tissues around the eye. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including redness, swelling, and pain around the eye. However, orbital cellulitis is usually not associated with proptosis or ptosis.

The patient's presentation is consistent with a cardioembolic stroke. He has a history of atrial fibrillation, which is a risk factor for stroke. He also presents with acute-onset aphasia, right-sided hemiplegia, and a temperature of 39°C. These findings are consistent with a stroke in the left hemisphere. The magnetic resonance imaging findings of left-hemisphere watershed areas of diffusion restriction are also consistent with a stroke.

The patient's blood cultures grew Streptococcus mitis, which is a common cause of infective endocarditis. However, the patient does not have any other signs or symptoms of infective endocarditis, such as fever, chills, night sweats, or a heart murmur. Additionally, the transesophageal echocardiogram did not show any vegetations, which are characteristic of infective endocarditis.

The patient's presentation is not consistent with an atrioesophageal fistula or a patent foramen ovale and paradoxical embolus. An atrioesophageal fistula is a communication between the atrium of the heart and the esophagus. A patent foramen ovale is a hole in the wall between the two atria of the heart. Both of these conditions can lead to paradoxical embolism, which is a situation in which a blood clot that forms in the venous system travels to the arterial system and lodges in the brain. However, the patient does not have any risk factors for these conditions, and the magnetic resonance imaging findings do not support a diagnosis of paradoxical embolism.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is cardioembolic stroke from atrial fibrillation.

 46%|████▌     | 697/1525 [2:40:01<3:22:02, 14.64s/it]The answer is A: Hydrocele.

Explanation:

A hydrocele is a collection of fluid around the testicle. It is the most common cause of scrotal swelling in children. In adults, it is usually caused by a problem with the veins that drain the testicle.

The symptoms of a hydrocele include:

* A painless swelling in the scrotum
* A feeling of fullness or heaviness in the scrotum
* A dragging sensation in the groin

The diagnosis of a hydrocele is usually made by physical examination. The doctor will feel the scrotum to determine the size and location of the swelling. They may also order an ultrasound to confirm the diagnosis.

Treatment for a hydrocele is usually not necessary. However, if the hydrocele is large or causing discomfort, it can be drained with a needle or surgically removed.

The other options are incorrect because:

* Intermittent testicular torsion is a condition in which the testicle rotates on its spermatic cord, cutting off the blood supply to the testicle. This can cause severe pain, swelling, and nausea.
* Primary testicular lymphoma is a type of cancer that starts in the testicle. It is a rare condition, but it is the most common type of cancer in men between the ages of 20 and 35.
* Scrotal cystocele is a condition in which a cystocele, or hernia, pushes into the scrotum. This can cause swelling, pain, and discomfort.

Explanation:

The patient presented with a history of migraine headaches and bilateral visual field loss. On examination, she had a right-sided homonymous hemianopia. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed subacute infarction of portions of the left occipital, temporal, and parietal lobes.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is migraine-related stroke. Migraine-related stroke is a rare but serious complication of migraine headaches. It is thought to occur when a migraine headache causes a narrowing of blood vessels in the brain, which can lead to a stroke.

The treatment for migraine-related stroke is supportive. This includes measures to control the patient's blood pressure and blood sugar levels, as well as treatment of any other medical problems that may be present. There is no specific treatment for migraine-related stroke, and the prognosis is variable. Some patients make a full recovery, while others have permanent neurological deficits.

In this case, the patient is young and has no other medical problems. She is also currently being treated for her migraine headaches. Therefore, the best course of action is to observe her closely and monitor her for any changes in her condition. If she develops any new symptoms, such as worsening headache, fever, or seizures, she should be evaluated immediately.

A. Begin treatment with calcium channel blockers for migraine prevention is incorrect because calcium channel blockers are not effective in preventing migraine-related stroke.

B. Perform cerebral angiography is incorrect because cerebral angiography is not necessary to diagnose migraine-related stroke.

C. Begin treatment with tissue plasminogen activator is incorrect because tissue plasminogen activator is a thrombolytic medication that is used to treat acute ischemic stroke. It is not effective in treating migraine-related stroke.

The patient is a 16-year-old girl with blurry vision. She has no other symptoms and is otherwise healthy with no medical history of any disease or surgeries. She is not taking any medications. Her family history is also unremarkable.

The patient’s best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU, results of pupillary examination were normal without relative afferent pupillary defect, and results of the rest of the anterior segment examination were unremarkable. Posterior segment examination of the right eye revealed a slightly elevated, white, multicystic lesion approximately 3 disc diameters that was located inferior to the optic nerve. Results of examination of the left eye were unremarkable. The patient’s blurred vision was resolved with new eyeglasses.

The most likely diagnosis is a benign retinal lesion, such as a retinal nevus. Retinal nevi are common and usually do not cause any problems. However, they can occasionally grow or change in appearance, which can be concerning. Therefore, it is important to follow up on retinal nevi with regular eye exams.

In this case, the patient's blurred vision was resolved with new eyeglasses. This suggests that the lesion is not causing any problems at the moment. Therefore, the best course of action is to follow up in 12 months to reexamine the lesion. This will allow the doctor to see if the lesion has changed or grown. If it has, further testing may be necessary. However, if the lesion has not changed or grown, the patient can be reassured that it is likely benign.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Intravenous fluorescein angiography is a test that is used to visualize the blood vessels in the retina. It is not necessary in this case because the patient does not have any symptoms that suggest a problem with the blood vessels in the retina. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain is a test that is used to visualize the brain. It is not necessary in this case because the patient does not have any symptoms that suggest a problem with the brain. Requesting fundus examination of the family members is not necessary in this case because the patient has no family history of eye disease.

Explanation:
The patient is a young woman with sudden-onset visual loss in the right eye. She had recently traveled to Ireland, where she rode a horse. She denied previous upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract infections. She had no other abnormal neurologic signs or symptoms.

The initial ophthalmologic workup was unremarkable. However, at a subsequent visit, 2 small glistening lesions in the retina were identified. These lesions are consistent with nematodes, which are parasitic worms that can infect the eye.

A high-magnification fundus contact lens examination is the best way to visualize nematodes in the eye. This procedure involves placing a small lens on the surface of the eye to magnify the image. This allows the doctor to see the nematodes and make a diagnosis.

Treatment for nematodes in the eye typically involves removing the worms with surgery. In some cases, medication may also be necessary.

The other options are not appropriate for this patient. Indocyanine green angiography is a test that is used to visualize blood vessels in the eye. It is not useful for diagnosing nematodes in the eye. Referring the patient to neurology is not appropriate at this time, as there is no evidence of a neurological disorder. Beginning treatment with high-dose corticosteroids is also not appropriate, as this may worsen the infection.

The patient's history and examination are consistent with Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), a rare, inherited optic neuropathy that causes sudden, painless, bilateral vision loss. LHON is caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA, which is passed down from mothers to sons. The most common mutation is the 11778 mutation, which is present in about 90% of cases of LHON.

The diagnosis of LHON is made based on the patient's history, examination, and laboratory tests. The visual field test typically shows a central scotoma, which is a blind spot in the center of vision. The optic nerve may be pale, and the blood vessels may be dilated. Laboratory tests may show elevated levels of lactate and pyruvate in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid.

There is no cure for LHON, but there are treatments that can help to improve vision. These treatments include vitamin B12 supplementation, optic nerve sheath fenestration, and stem cell transplantation.

The other options are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate next steps in the management of this patient.

A. Check methylmalonic acid level and replete vitamin B12 if elevated is not the most appropriate next step because the patient's history and examination are not consistent with vitamin B12 deficiency.

B. Repeat magnetic resonance imaging is not the most appropriate next step because the patient's magnetic resonance imaging findings were normal.

C. Recommend lumbar puncture is not the most appropriate next step because lumbar puncture is not necessary to diagnose LHON.

The patient's history of recent travel to Gabon and the presence of bilateral optic disc edema with a circumferential halo are suggestive of a diagnosis of fungal meningitis. The most common cause of fungal meningitis in patients with recent travel to sub-Saharan Africa is cryptococcal meningitis. Cryptococcal meningitis is a serious infection that can be fatal if not treated promptly. The treatment of choice for cryptococcal meningitis is a combination of amphotericin B and flucytosine.

Penicillin is not effective against Cryptococcus neoformans, the fungus that causes cryptococcal meningitis. Acetazolamide is a diuretic that is used to treat increased intracranial pressure. However, it is not effective against fungal meningitis. Discontinuing doxycycline is not necessary, as it is not known to cause or worsen fungal meningitis.

In conclusion, the correct answer is: A. Begin amphotericin B and 5-flucytosine.

The patient has a number of congenital anomalies, including coarctation of the aorta, aortic stenosis, cerebellar hemorrhage, hydrocephalus treated with ventriculoperitoneal shunt, scoliosis due to hemivertebrae, congenital diaphragmatic and umbilical hernia, and hearing loss. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of Joubert syndrome, which is a rare genetic disorder characterized by cerebellar hypoplasia, developmental delay, and other congenital anomalies. Genetic testing is the most definitive way to diagnose Joubert syndrome. If the patient is found to have Joubert syndrome, he may benefit from genetic counseling and treatment for his specific symptoms.

OCT angiography (A) is a non-invasive imaging technique that can be used to assess the blood vessels in the retina. It is not a definitive test for Joubert syndrome, and it would not be helpful in this case. Topical ocular hypotensive therapy (B) is a treatment for glaucoma, which is not a condition that this patient has.

The patient has acute coronary syndrome, which is a medical emergency. The most common treatment for acute coronary syndrome is percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), also known as balloon angioplasty and stenting. PCI involves inserting a balloon into the narrowed artery and inflating it to widen the artery. A stent, a small metal mesh tube, may then be inserted to keep the artery open.

PCI is a very effective treatment for acute coronary syndrome. It can improve symptoms, reduce the risk of complications, and improve survival. In this case, the patient has ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), which is the most serious type of acute coronary syndrome. STEMI is caused by a complete blockage of an artery, which deprives the heart muscle of oxygen. PCI is the preferred treatment for STEMI, as it can quickly restore blood flow to the heart muscle and reduce the risk of death and other complications.

The other options are incorrect because they are not as effective as PCI for treating acute coronary syndrome. Defer intervention and continue supportive management is a reasonable option for patients with non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), which is a less serious type of acute coronary syndrome. However, it is not a reasonable option for patients with STEMI, as they need to receive treatment as soon as possible to reduce the risk of death and other complications. Refer for emergency coronary artery bypass grafting surgery is an option for patients who are not candidates for PCI or who have failed PCI. However, it is not the preferred treatment for patients with STEMI, as PCI is a more effective treatment.

In conclusion, the correct answer is A: Perform PCI to the left anterior descending artery and second diagonal branch with drug-eluting stents.

Rosai-Dorfman disease is a rare, benign disorder characterized by histiocytic proliferation in lymph nodes, skin, and other organs. It is most commonly seen in children and young adults, and is usually self-limiting.

The diagnosis of Rosai-Dorfman disease is based on clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and histopathologic examination. The characteristic histopathologic findings include proliferation of histiocytes with emperipolesis, which is the presence of lymphocytes or other cells within the cytoplasm of histiocytes.

There is no specific treatment for Rosai-Dorfman disease, and most cases resolve spontaneously. However, in some cases, treatment with steroids or other immunosuppressive agents may be necessary.

The other options are incorrect because they are not characterized by emperipolesis.

* Infectious mononucleosis is a viral infection that is characterized by fever, lymphadenopathy, and pharyngitis. It is not associated with emperipolesis.
* Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare, non-cancerous disorder characterized by the proliferation of Langerhans cells, which are a type of histiocyte. It is not associated with emperipolesis.
* Reactive sinus histiocytosis is a benign condition that is characterized by the proliferation of histiocytes in the sinuses. It is not associated with emperipolesis.

Explanation:

Pleomorphic adenoma is the most common benign salivary gland tumor, accounting for up to 70% of all cases. It is a slow-growing, painless mass that can occur in any salivary gland, but is most common in the parotid gland. The tumor is usually well-encapsulated and can be completely excised with surgery. The prognosis for pleomorphic adenoma is excellent, with a recurrence rate of less than 5%.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Mucocele is a benign cystic lesion that is filled with mucus. It is typically caused by blockage of a salivary duct. Mucoceles are usually small and painless, and they can be treated with simple drainage.
* Lipoma is a benign fatty tumor. It is the most common soft tissue tumor, and it can occur anywhere in the body. Lipomas are usually soft and non-tender, and they can be removed surgically if they are causing problems.
* Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a malignant salivary gland tumor. It is the most common malignant salivary gland tumor in children, and it is the second most common malignant salivary gland tumor in adults. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is usually a slow-growing tumor, and it can be treated with surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.

The patient in the case presented with a slow-growing, painless, nodular mass on the superficial layer of the left upper lip. The mass was well-encapsulated and was completely excised without rupture of the capsule from the surrounding mucosa. On histopathologic examination, an encapsulated salivary gland tumor with epithelial and myoepithelial cells, ductlike structures, and mixed stroma was observed. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of pleomorphic adenoma.

Explanation:

* Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is a chronic, autoimmune skin disease that can affect any part of the body, but most commonly affects the face, scalp, and ears. DLE is characterized by well-defined, erythematous (red), scaly patches that may be tender or painful.
* The patient in the case presentation presents with a slowly growing erythematous plaque on the left lower eyelid, with occasional discomfort. This is consistent with the clinical presentation of DLE.
* Dermoscopy of the lesion shows an erythematous background, telangiectatic vessels, whitish structureless areas, and whitish scales. These findings are also consistent with DLE.
* Histopathological analysis of the lesion shows a dense perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with mucin deposition in the papillary dermis. This is the classic histopathological finding of DLE.
* Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease of unknown etiology. The skin is involved in approximately 25% of cases of sarcoidosis, but the lesions are typically non-specific and do not have the characteristic features of DLE.
* Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common type of skin cancer. BCC typically presents as a small, raised, pearly papule with telangiectasias. The lesion in the case presentation does not have the characteristic features of BCC.
* Bowen disease is a precancerous skin lesion that is characterized by an erythematous, scaly plaque. The lesion in the case presentation could be Bowen disease, but the clinical presentation and dermoscopic findings are more consistent with DLE.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is discoid lupus erythematosus.

Explanation:
The patient in the case presented with multiple, discrete atrophic scars on the pretibial areas extending onto the lateral aspect of both legs. The plaques were surmounted by multiple, discrete atrophic scars. The periphery of the plaques showed increased vascularity in the form of telangiectasias and venous prominences, along with atrophy of the overlying skin. There were no lesions elsewhere on the body. A skin biopsy sample was obtained from the plaque and sent for histopathological examination. The biopsy showed unremarkable epidermis and multiple epithelioid cell granulomas in the entire dermis. Compact, noncaseating, epithelioid cell granulomas with multiple Langhans giant cells were also seen.

The clinical presentation and histopathological findings are consistent with a diagnosis of cutaneous sarcoidosis. Cutaneous sarcoidosis is a chronic granulomatous disease of unknown etiology that can affect any part of the skin. The most common presentation is multiple, discrete, erythematous plaques on the face, upper trunk, and extremities. Other possible manifestations include nodules, ulcers, and scars. Cutaneous sarcoidosis is usually self-limited, but some cases may be persistent or recurrent. The treatment of cutaneous sarcoidosis is generally aimed at controlling the symptoms and preventing complications. Treatment options include topical corticosteroids, systemic corticosteroids, and other immunosuppressive agents.

Granulomatous mycosis fungoides is a rare form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that typically presents with patches or plaques on the skin. The lesions may be pruritic or painful, and they may eventually ulcerate. Histopathological examination shows a dense infiltrate of lymphocytes, histiocytes, and Langerhans cells. Granulomatous mycosis fungoides is a slowly progressive disease, and it may take many years to transform into a systemic lymphoma. The treatment of granulomatous mycosis fungoides is generally with systemic chemotherapy.

Pretibial myxedema is a rare, localized form of hypothyroidism that affects the skin of the anterior tibia. The lesions are typically firm, waxy, and nonpitting edema. They may be associated with other signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as fatigue, weight gain, and hair loss. The treatment of pretibial myxedema is with thyroid hormone replacement therapy.

Necrobiosis lipoidica is a chronic, progressive, inflammatory skin disorder that typically affects the lower legs. The lesions are typically well-demarcated, atrophic plaques with a central area of yellow-brown discoloration. They may be associated with pain, pruritus, and ulceration. The treatment of necrobiosis lipoidica is generally with topical corticosteroids, systemic corticosteroids, or other immunosuppressive agents.

 47%|████▋     | 710/1525 [2:42:59<3:24:14, 15.04s/it]The answer is **B: Cutaneous silica granuloma**.

The patient is a miner who sustained injuries from an accidental land mine explosion 15 years earlier. The wounds apparently healed without difficulty, leaving only scars of expected severity. Approximately 6 months before presentation, the patient began to notice an increase in the size of these lesions. Physical examination showed multiple firm, erythematous, nontender papules, nodules, and small plaques on his face, his chin, the anterior portion of his neck, and the anterior thorax.

The most likely diagnosis is cutaneous silica granuloma. This is a chronic granulomatous reaction to silica dust, which is a common contaminant in the environment. It is most commonly seen in miners, sandblasters, and other workers who are exposed to silica dust. The lesions are typically firm, erythematous, and nontender. They may be papular, nodular, or plaque-like. They may occur anywhere on the body, but are most commonly seen on the hands, feet, arms, and legs.

The diagnosis of cutaneous silica granuloma is made based on the history, physical examination, and biopsy findings. The biopsy shows a non-caseating granuloma with multinucleated giant cells. Treatment is typically with topical steroids or oral steroids. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the lesions.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely. Sarcoidosis is a systemic disease that can affect any organ system, including the skin. However, it is not typically seen in miners. Infectious granulomas can be caused by a variety of organisms, including bacteria, fungi, and parasites. However, there is no history of infection in this patient. Keloids are raised, fibrous scars that can develop after an injury. However, they are typically smooth and shiny, and they are not associated with erythema or tenderness.

Explanation: The patient is a man in his 60s with a known history of a large cyst on the right kidney who sustained blunt trauma in a skiing crash. Computed tomography (CT) showed a right-sided grade IV renal injury involving his known renal cyst with active arterial extravasation. The patient underwent selective angioembolization of the renal laceration.

In the 24 hours after embolization, the patient required 2 U of red blood cells via transfusion for anemia. On examination, the patient reported moderate pain in the abdomen and right side and demonstrated a distended abdomen in the absence of any peritoneal signs. Contrast-enhanced CT of the abdomen and pelvis was performed to assess for a source of continued bleeding.

The CT scan shows a large right-sided retroperitoneal hematoma and grade IV renal laceration displacing the patient’s abdominal viscera to the left, with a contrast-filled structure medial to the liver. This contrast-filled structure is the gallbladder, which is normally not seen on CT scans. The presence of contrast in the gallbladder suggests that it is injured and leaking bile.

The other options are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms and findings on CT scan. A hepatic artery injury would not typically cause a distended abdomen, and there is no evidence of intraluminal contrast extravasation on the CT scan. A jejunal injury would not typically cause a contrast-filled structure medial to the liver. A rupture of a peripancreatic pseudoaneurysm would not typically cause a distended abdomen in the absence of any peritoneal signs.

The patient's history and presentation are consistent with paraproteinemic maculopathy, a rare condition characterized by the deposition of paraproteins in the retina, which can lead to vision loss. Paraproteins are abnormal proteins that can be produced by plasma cells, a type of white blood cell. They can be detected in the blood and urine.

The diagnosis of paraproteinemic maculopathy is made based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. The most important laboratory test is plasma electrophoresis, which can detect the presence of paraproteins in the blood. Bone marrow analysis can also be helpful, as it can identify the source of the paraprotein production.

The treatment of paraproteinemic maculopathy is aimed at reducing the production of paraproteins and relieving the inflammation in the retina. This can be done with medications such as chemotherapy and steroids. In some cases, surgery may also be necessary to remove the paraprotein deposits from the retina.

The prognosis for patients with paraproteinemic maculopathy varies depending on the severity of the condition. With early diagnosis and treatment, most patients can maintain good vision. However, some patients may experience permanent vision loss.

Here are the reasons why the other answers are incorrect:

* A: Intravitreal dexamethasone implant is a treatment option for diabetic macular edema, but it is not effective for paraproteinemic maculopathy.
* B: Grid photocoagulation is a treatment option for diabetic retinopathy, but it is not effective for paraproteinemic maculopathy.
* D: Oral corticosteroids are a treatment option for many inflammatory conditions, but they are not effective for paraproteinemic maculopathy.

The patient has bilateral choroidal effusions, which are a known complication of cidofovir therapy. Cidofovir is a nephrotoxic drug, and the patient has a history of chronic kidney disease. Restarting cidofovir therapy would likely worsen the patient's kidney function and could lead to permanent kidney damage.

Topical corticosteroids and cycloplegia are the standard treatment for choroidal effusions. Corticosteroids reduce inflammation, and cycloplegia paralyzes the ciliary muscles, which helps to reduce pain and improve vision.

Bilateral subtenon corticosteroid injections and oral prednisone are not indicated for the treatment of choroidal effusions. Bilateral subtenon corticosteroid injections are used to treat inflammation of the sclera, and oral prednisone is a systemic corticosteroid that is used to treat a variety of inflammatory conditions.

Therefore, the best course of treatment for this patient is to discontinue cidofovir therapy and start therapy with topical corticosteroids and cycloplegia.

A fluorescein angiogram is a test that uses a special dye to visualize the blood vessels in the eye. It is a valuable tool for diagnosing and managing diabetic retinopathy. In this case, the patient has a history of proliferative diabetic retinopathy, which is a serious complication of diabetes that can lead to blindness. A fluorescein angiogram can help to determine the extent of the disease and to identify the best course of treatment.

The other options are incorrect because they are not necessary or appropriate at this time. Option B, determining blood glucose level and performing glycated hemoglobin test, is important for the management of diabetes, but it is not the most important step in the management of this patient's vision loss. Option C, measuring heart rate, respiratory rate, and blood pressure, is important for the general assessment of the patient's health, but it is not specific for the patient's vision loss. Option D, performing immediate computed tomography of the head, is not necessary or appropriate at this time. The patient does not have any symptoms that suggest a neurological problem, and a CT scan of the head is not likely to provide any useful information.

In conclusion, the correct answer is A: Obtain a fluorescein angiogram.

The patient is a 14-year-old girl with progressive vision loss in both eyes. She has optic nerve atrophy, retinal nerve fiber layer thinning, and bilateral central scotomas. Her MRI shows thickening and nodular enhancement of bilateral perioptic nerve sheaths extending up to the orbital apex. Patchy T2-weighted hyperintensity is noted within the bilateral optic nerves.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of optic nerve sheath meningioma. Optic nerve sheath meningiomas are benign tumors that arise from the arachnoid membrane that surrounds the optic nerve. They are the most common type of meningioma to involve the orbit.

The treatment of optic nerve sheath meningiomas is controversial. Some experts recommend observation, while others recommend treatment with surgery, radiotherapy, or a combination of both.

Observation is a reasonable option for patients with small, asymptomatic tumors. However, observation is not appropriate for patients with large tumors, progressive vision loss, or optic nerve dysfunction.

Surgery is the most common treatment for optic nerve sheath meningiomas. Surgery can be used to remove the tumor, relieve pressure on the optic nerve, and improve vision. However, surgery is not always possible, and it can sometimes damage the optic nerve.

Radiotherapy is an effective treatment for optic nerve sheath meningiomas. Radiotherapy can be used to shrink the tumor and relieve pressure on the optic nerve. However, radiotherapy can sometimes damage the optic nerve.

In this case, the patient has a large tumor, progressive vision loss, and optic nerve dysfunction. Therefore, the best treatment option is a combination of surgery and radiotherapy. Surgery will be used to remove as much of the tumor as possible, and radiotherapy will be used to shrink the remaining tumor and relieve pressure on the optic nerve.

The following are the reasons why the other options are incorrect:

* Observation is not appropriate for patients with large tumors, progressive vision loss, or optic nerve dysfunction.
* Optic nerve sheath biopsy is not a curative treatment for optic nerve sheath meningiomas. It can be used to diagnose the tumor, but it does not improve vision.
* Radiotherapy alone is not a curative treatment for optic nerve sheath meningiomas. It can be used to shrink the tumor and relieve pressure on the optic nerve, but it does not always improve vision.

Lichen planopilaris is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the hair follicles that is characterized by scarring alopecia. It is most commonly seen in middle-aged and elderly women. The lesions of lichen planopilaris are typically small, flat-topped papules that are arranged in a follicular pattern. They may be pruritic or painful. The diagnosis of lichen planopilaris is made based on the clinical appearance of the lesions and a skin biopsy.

The histopathologic features of lichen planopilaris include a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate in the superficial dermis, with associated follicular destruction. Focal epithelial necrosis and mucin deposition may also be seen.

The treatment of lichen planopilaris is aimed at controlling the inflammation and preventing further hair loss. Topical corticosteroids, such as clobetasol propionate, are often used as first-line therapy. In more severe cases, systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents may be necessary.

In the case presented, the patient has a history of biopsy-proven scalp lichen planopilaris. She now presents with an increasing number of slightly pruritic facial papules that coincided with the start of her hair loss condition. The physical examination reveals numerous 1-mm skin-colored grouped monomorphic noninflammatory papules on the bilateral temples, the bilateral cheeks, and the chin. The histopathologic examination of a representative lesion shows a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate in the superficial dermis, with associated follicular destruction. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of lichen planopilaris.

The other options are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation. Trichoepitheliomas are benign tumors of the hair follicle that typically present as small, flesh-colored papules on the face. Miliary osteoma cutis is a rare condition characterized by the presence of small, hard, white papules on the face and extremities. Angiofibromas are benign tumors of the blood vessels that typically present as small, pink or red papules on the face.

Explanation:
Pemphigus vegetans is a rare, autoimmune blistering disease characterized by the formation of large, vegetating (wart-like) lesions on the skin and mucous membranes. The lesions are often located in the intertriginous areas, such as the armpits, groin, and under the breasts.

In the case presented, the patient has a history of painful intertriginous wounds that have been unresponsive to treatment. She also has a history of hidradenitis suppurativa, which is a chronic inflammatory condition that can cause painful, abscess-forming lesions in the skin folds. However, the patient's current lesions do not have the typical appearance of hidradenitis suppurativa. They are instead linear, moist, eroded, exophytic, and condyloma-like. This suggests that the patient may have pemphigus vegetans.

The diagnosis of pemphigus vegetans is confirmed by biopsy. Histopathology of a biopsy specimen from the patient's lesions shows a characteristic acanthosis (thickening of the epidermis) with a band of spongiosis (swelling of the epidermis) and neutrophils in the upper dermis. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of pemphigus vegetans.

The treatment of pemphigus vegetans is with immunosuppressive medications, such as corticosteroids and azathioprine. The goal of treatment is to suppress the immune system and prevent the formation of new lesions. Treatment can be difficult and may require lifelong immunosuppression.

The patient in the case presented was treated with azathioprine and corticosteroids. Her lesions improved with treatment, but she continues to require immunosuppression to prevent recurrence.

Seborrheic dermatitis is a common skin condition that causes flaking, redness, and itching of the scalp. It is usually not associated with other systemic symptoms.

Crusted scabies is a contagious skin infection caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. It is characterized by intense itching, small red bumps, and burrows in the skin. It is not typically associated with osteolytic lesions.

Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes the skin cells to grow too quickly. It is characterized by red, scaly patches on the skin. It is not typically associated with osteolytic lesions.

Multisystem Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disorder of the immune system that affects the skin, bones, and other organs. It is characterized by the presence of Langerhans cells, a type of white blood cell, in the affected tissues. It is associated with osteolytic lesions in up to 50% of cases.

The patient in this case has a history of nonhealing crusted scalp lesions, as well as osteolytic lesions on the skull. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of multisystem Langerhans cell histiocytosis. The histopathological analysis of the scalp biopsy specimen showed a subepidermal infiltrate consisting of large cells with kidney-shaped nuclei, solitary lymphocytes, and eosinophilic granulocytes. This is also consistent with a diagnosis of multisystem Langerhans cell histiocytosis. The immunohistochemical staining was positive for CD1A, which is a marker of Langerhans cells. This further supports the diagnosis of multisystem Langerhans cell histiocytosis.

The patient in this case has a complex medical history and a number of developmental delays. He has a microdeletion of the 16p11.2 region of chromosome 16, which is associated with a number of behavioral problems, including irritability, agitation, and self-injury.

The first step in managing this patient's behavior is to provide him with a structured and predictable environment. This will help to reduce his anxiety and frustration, which can trigger outbursts. It is also important to provide him with positive reinforcement for appropriate behavior and to ignore inappropriate behavior.

If these measures are not effective in controlling the patient's behavior, then medication may be necessary. Aripiprazole is a medication that is used to treat a variety of psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and irritability associated with autism spectrum disorder. It has been shown to be effective in reducing irritability, agitation, and self-injury in children with autism spectrum disorder.

In addition to medication, the patient should also be enrolled in a behavioral intervention program. This program will teach him how to manage his emotions and behavior in a more appropriate way. It will also provide him with the opportunity to interact with other children and learn new skills.

The other options are not as appropriate in this case. Referral of family members for genetic testing is not necessary at this time, as the patient's diagnosis is already known. Pharmacotherapy with R-baclofen is not a first-line treatment for irritability, agitation, and self-injury in children with autism spectrum disorder. Pharmacotherapy with citalopram is a medication that is used to treat depression, and it is not as effective as aripiprazole for treating irritability, agitation, and self-injury in children with autism spectrum disorder.

Juvenile plantar dermatosis is a common, benign skin condition that affects children and adolescents. It is characterized by well-demarcated, scaly patches on the soles of the feet. The lesions are usually asymptomatic, but they can be pruritic. The cause of juvenile plantar dermatosis is unknown, but it is thought to be a reaction to friction or sweating. Treatment is usually not necessary, but topical corticosteroids or emollients may be helpful.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Tinea pedis (athlete's foot) is a fungal infection of the feet. It is characterized by itching, burning, and scaling of the skin between the toes. Tinea pedis is often associated with other fungal infections, such as jock itch and ringworm.
* Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes the skin cells to grow too quickly. This results in thick, red, scaly patches on the skin. Psoriasis can affect any part of the body, but it is most commonly found on the elbows, knees, scalp, and lower back.
* Pityriasis rubra pilaris is a rare skin condition that causes redness, scaling, and itching of the skin. It is characterized by a "salmon-colored" rash that starts on the trunk and spreads to the extremities. Pityriasis rubra pilaris is usually a self-limiting condition, but it can be difficult to treat.

In the case presented, the patient is a healthy adolescent girl with a prolonged dermatitis of both feet characterized by pruritus and accompanying desquamation. Physical examination revealed well-demarcated desquamative patches with scales on both distal feet, showing a sandal appearance. No local heat, swelling, or discharge from the skin lesions was noted. The patient’s medical history was otherwise unremarkable and she had no known history of atopic dermatitis. A fungal smear skin test with potassium hydroxide preparation was performed on the lesion, which showed negative findings.

Explanation:
The patient is a young man with a history of hyperlipidemia who presents with abdominal pain associated with unintentional weight loss for 6 months. He has a palpable mass of about 15 cm in the left paraumbilical region and a missing left testis. A computed tomography scan of the thorax, abdomen, and pelvis reveals large intraperitoneal and retroperitoneal masses. The intraperitoneal heterogenous mass was 20 × 15 × 11 cm, with linear calcifications. There was a right moderate hydronephrosis. The retroperitoneal mass was homogeneous, with associated lymphadenopathy encircling the aorta, inferior mesenteric artery, and both renal arteries. A large left supraclavicular lymph node and left inguinal lymph node were also detected. There was no metastasis identified elsewhere. Serum lactate dehydrogenase was elevated at 1358 U/L, β human chorionic gonadotrophin was elevated at 1485 mIU/mL, and α fetoprotein levels were normal.

The most likely diagnosis is non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The patient's age, history of hyperlipidemia, abdominal pain, weight loss, palpable mass, and elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase are all consistent with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The presence of a left supraclavicular lymph node is also a characteristic finding in non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The computed tomography scan findings are also consistent with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The intraperitoneal heterogenous mass with linear calcifications is a typical appearance of a non-Hodgkin lymphoma mass. The retroperitoneal mass with associated lymphadenopathy is also a characteristic finding in non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The absence of metastasis identified elsewhere makes other diagnoses less likely.

Colorectal cancer is less likely in this patient because he is young and does not have any other risk factors for colorectal cancer. Bladder cancer is also less likely because the patient does not have any urinary symptoms. Testicular cancer is also less likely because the patient has a normal right testis.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

The laboratory test findings of a leukocytosis are also consistent with an acute inflammatory process. The abdominal CT scan findings of a pneumoperitoneum and free fluid in the lower quadrants of the abdomen are also consistent with a diagnosis of duodenal injury.

A pancreatic injury is less likely in this patient because he does not have any abdominal pain that radiates to the back, and his laboratory test findings do not show an elevated amylase level. A flaring ulcerative colitis is less likely in this patient because he has not had any recent changes in his ulcerative colitis treatment, and his abdominal pain is not typical of a flare of ulcerative colitis. A rectosigmoid junction rupture is less likely in this patient because he does not have any rectal bleeding or a history of constipation.

 47%|████▋     | 723/1525 [2:45:42<2:45:11, 12.36s/it]The correct answer is **A: Surgery**.

The patient has a foreign body in the vitreous, which is the jelly-like substance that fills the inside of the eye. This foreign body can cause inflammation, infection, and retinal detachment. The only way to remove the foreign body and prevent these complications is surgery.

Observation, laboratory workup for uveitis, and topical and systemic corticosteroid treatment are not appropriate for this patient. Observation would not remove the foreign body and could allow the inflammation to progress. Laboratory workup for uveitis would not be helpful in this case, as the patient already has vitritis. Topical and systemic corticosteroid treatment can help to reduce inflammation, but it would not remove the foreign body and could mask the symptoms of retinal detachment.

The patient should undergo surgery to remove the foreign body as soon as possible.

 47%|████▋     | 724/1525 [2:45:55<2:50:50, 12.80s/it]The correct answer is: **B. Administer intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment.**

The patient in this case has several large pigment epithelial detachments (PEDs) with associated tears and scrolling of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) seen on enhanced-depth imaging optical coherence tomography (OCT) in the right eye. Intravenous fluorescein angiography demonstrated several large window defects with hyperfluorescence in the regions of the RPE tears in the late phase. Indocyanine green angiography was also performed and did not reveal any hyperfluorescent regions.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is a serous retinal detachment secondary to RPE tears. Serous retinal detachments are caused by a break in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), which allows fluid to leak into the space between the RPE and the retina. This can cause a loss of vision, which can be permanent if not treated.

The treatment for serous retinal detachment secondary to RPE tears is usually intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment. VEGF is a protein that promotes the growth of new blood vessels. In the case of serous retinal detachment, VEGF can cause the growth of new blood vessels in the vitreous cavity, which can further damage the retina. Intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor treatment blocks the effects of VEGF, which can help to prevent further damage to the retina and allow the retinal detachment to resolve.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Option A, "Monitor the patient," is not appropriate because the patient has already lost significant vision. Option C, "Refer the patient to the nephrologist for evaluation of kidney function," is not appropriate because the patient's kidney function is not relevant to the diagnosis or treatment of serous retinal detachment. Option D, "Provide photodynamic therapy with verteporfin," is not appropriate because photodynamic therapy is not effective for serous retinal detachment secondary to RPE tears.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is concerning for a posterior fossa mass lesion, which could be a tumor, abscess, or hemorrhage. The patient's symptoms of blurred vision, diplopia, and disorientation are consistent with a mass lesion that is compressing the brainstem. The patient's chest radiograph shows consolidation in the right lower lobe, which could be a source of infection that has spread to the brain. The patient's tuberculin skin test, sputum for acid-fast bacilli, and sputum culture were negative, which makes tuberculosis less likely. However, the patient's erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein level are elevated, which suggests an inflammatory process.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to order an urgent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. MRI is the most sensitive imaging modality for detecting brain lesions. The MRI will help to determine the size, location, and nature of the mass lesion. The MRI will also help to determine whether the mass lesion is causing compression of the brainstem or other brain structures.

If the MRI shows a mass lesion, the patient will need to be evaluated by a neurosurgeon. The neurosurgeon will discuss the options for treatment, which may include surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.

The other options are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate next steps in the evaluation of this patient. A lumbar puncture is not necessary at this time because the patient does not have any signs or symptoms of meningitis. Repeat sputum culture and sensitivity testing is not necessary because the patient's tuberculin skin test, sputum for acid-fast bacilli, and sputum culture were negative. Starting broad-spectrum intravenous antibiotics is not necessary at this time because the patient does not have any signs or symptoms of infection.

Explanation:
The patient has a history of narrow angles and ocular hypertension, which are risk factors for angle-closure glaucoma. The progressive scleral pigmentation is concerning for pigmentary glaucoma, a subtype of angle-closure glaucoma that is associated with diffuse iris and trabecular meshwork pigmentation. A B-scan ultrasonography is a non-invasive imaging test that can be used to evaluate the anterior chamber angle and rule out angle closure. Reviewing the patient's medical history and systemic medications is also important, as certain medications such as beta blockers can worsen angle closure. Discontinuation of antiglaucomatous medications is not indicated at this time, as these medications are effective in reducing intraocular pressure and preventing progression of glaucoma. Obtaining a 24-hour urine sample is not indicated in this case, as this test is used to evaluate for systemic causes of secondary glaucoma such as renal disease.

Explanation:

The patient has a worsening corneal ulcer, hypopyon, and elevated intraocular pressure. These findings suggest an infectious keratitis. The initial treatment with topical antibiotics was not effective, and the hypopyon has worsened. Therefore, it is necessary to obtain cultures of the anterior chamber fluid to identify the infecting organism and guide further treatment. An anterior chamber paracentesis is a procedure in which a small amount of fluid is removed from the anterior chamber of the eye. The fluid can then be sent for culture and other tests.

Corneal biopsy is not necessary in this case because the diagnosis of infectious keratitis is already established. Injecting intravitreal antibiotics is not indicated in this case because there is no evidence of endophthalmitis (infection of the vitreous humor). Prednisolone eyedrops are a corticosteroid that can be used to reduce inflammation. However, they can also suppress the immune system, which could make the infection worse. Therefore, it is important to identify the infecting organism and treat it with the appropriate antibiotics before using corticosteroids.

Explanation:

The patient has bilateral corneal deposits 1 week after starting prednisone therapy. This is a known side effect of prednisone, and it is likely that the deposits are due to a drug-induced inflammation of the cornea. Topical prednisolone therapy is the standard treatment for this condition, and it is likely to be effective in resolving the deposits and improving the patient's vision.

Explanation:

The patient is a man in his 60s who presented with a 1-year history of a mild, dry cough. He was otherwise asymptomatic and had no physical limitations. He had never smoked, and results of his physical examination were normal. Results of complete blood cell counts, basic metabolic panel, and liver function tests were all within normal limits. A chest radiograph revealed a 10 × 9-cm lobulated left lower lobe mass. Examination of a biopsy specimen showed a primary adenocarcinoma with an immunohistochemical profile of CDX2 positive, CK20 positive, TTF-1 negative, and napsin A negative. His EGFR (OMIM 131550), ALK (OMIM 105590), and ROS1 (OMIM 165020) genes were wild type, and results of testing for programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) were 0%. Results of upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy and colonoscopy did not reveal any evidence of a primary malignant neoplasm. Positron emission tomography showed no evidence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy or extrathoracic disease. Given the patient’s excellent performance status, he underwent a mediastinoscopy with left lower lobe lobectomy. Results of postoperative pathologic testing showed a 13-cm adenocarcinoma with similar immunohistochemical markers as in the prior biopsy specimen. Surgical margins were negative for involvement, with no large vessel or perineural invasion seen. Five sampled lymph nodes were negative for involvement. Repeat pathologic interpretation was performed.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is PEA. PEA is a rare subtype of adenocarcinoma that arises from the pulmonary epithelium. It is characterized by a distinctive immunohistochemical profile, including positivity for CDX2 and CK20 and negativity for TTF-1 and napsin A. PEA is typically a non-smoker's cancer, and it is often diagnosed at an advanced stage. The prognosis for PEA is poor, with a median survival of approximately 1 year.

The other possible diagnoses in this case are metastatic colorectal cancer, adenocarcinoma of unknown primary, and lymphoma. Metastatic colorectal cancer is a common cause of adenocarcinoma in the lung, but it is unlikely in this case given the patient's history of never smoking and the negative results of his upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy and colonoscopy. Adenocarcinoma of unknown primary is a diagnosis of exclusion, and it is only made after a thorough investigation has failed to identify a primary tumor. Lymphoma is a rare cause of adenocarcinoma in the lung, and it is unlikely in this case given the patient's age and the negative results of his positron emission tomography scan.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis in this case is PEA.

The patient has a history of atrial flutter, which is a type of arrhythmia that can cause palpitations. The physical examination findings are consistent with right ventricular hypertrophy, which can be a complication of atrial flutter. The 12-lead electrocardiogram shows marked right axis deviation with poor R wave progression across the precordial leads V1-V6, which are findings that are consistent with right ventricular hypertrophy. An electrocardiogram with right-sided precordial leads would provide further information about the extent of right ventricular hypertrophy and the presence of any other abnormalities.

High-sensitivity troponin I is a blood test that is used to detect the presence of myocardial injury. Myocardial injury can be caused by a variety of conditions, including arrhythmias, heart attacks, and pulmonary embolism. In this case, the patient has a history of atrial flutter and right ventricular hypertrophy, which are risk factors for myocardial injury. However, the physical examination and 12-lead electrocardiogram findings are not consistent with myocardial injury. Therefore, obtaining a high-sensitivity troponin I level is not necessary at this time.

D-dimer is a blood test that is used to detect the presence of blood clots. Blood clots can be a complication of atrial flutter. However, the physical examination and 12-lead electrocardiogram findings are not consistent with blood clots. Therefore, obtaining a D-dimer level is not necessary at this time.

Ventilation/perfusion lung scan is a test that is used to detect the presence of pulmonary embolism. Pulmonary embolism is a blockage of a blood vessel in the lung. It is a serious condition that can be life-threatening. The patient has a history of atrial flutter, which is a risk factor for pulmonary embolism. However, the physical examination and 12-lead electrocardiogram findings are not consistent with pulmonary embolism.

Explanation: The patient is a woman in her 60s with a 3-month history of right-sided sinus pressure progressing to dental pain. She was prescribed antibiotics and steroids by her family physician, which initially provided intermittent, symptomatic improvement; however, she ultimately experienced a progressive decrease in tactile sensation on her face, anosmia, and changes in her right peripheral vision. She had a remote 2 pack-year smoking history. Sinus computed tomography (CT) and neck magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a large expansile mass arising from the right side of the skull base and nasopharynx with extension into the pterygopalatine fossa, masticator, parapharyngeal, retropharyngeal, and carotid spaces. In addition, imaging showed involvement of the right posterior orbit with erosion of the posterior maxillary sinus wall, anterior and middle cranial fossa with erosion through the cribriform plate, and cavernous sinus. Physical examination revealed slight right-sided facial fullness, grossly intact extraocular motion, decreased vision in the right lateral field, and palpable bilateral level 2 neck lymph nodes. Flexible laryngoscopy revealed a right-sided lobulated mass involving the medial middle turbinate, posterior septum, and nasal floor, as well as the posterior aspect of the maxillary sinus extending superiorly to the nasopharynx and skull base posteriorly. The mass extended into the left superior nasopharynx and superior septum. In-office biopsy specimens were obtained and revealed a primitive small round cell tumor with the following immunohistochemical (IHC) staining profile: diffusely positive for desmin, myogenin, and CD56; focally positive for low-molecular-weight kininogen (LMWCK), p63, and S-100; and negative for AE1/AE3, CK 5/6, CK7, CK20, p40, chromogranin, SOX10, HMB45, CD99, and CD20.

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is esthesioneuroblastoma. Esthesioneuroblastoma is a rare, malignant neuroendocrine tumor that arises from the olfactory epithelium. It is the most common type of sinonasal sarcoma. Esthesioneuroblastoma typically presents in adults in the 5th to 6th decade of life. The most common presenting symptoms are nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and anosmia. Imaging studies typically reveal a mass in the nasal cavity or paranasal sinuses. The diagnosis of esthesioneuroblastoma is made by biopsy. Treatment typically involves surgery, followed by radiation therapy and chemotherapy. The prognosis for patients with esthesioneuroblastoma is variable, but overall the disease is considered to be highly aggressive.

The other options are not as likely in this patient. Ewing sarcoma is a rare, malignant bone tumor that typically presents in children and adolescents. It is not typically associated with sinonasal involvement. Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma is a rare, malignant soft tissue tumor that can occur anywhere in the body. It is not typically associated with sinonasal involvement. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer of the lymph nodes. It is not typically associated with sinonasal involvement.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is esthesioneuroblastoma.

Explanation:

The patient presented with a history of COPD and dyspnea, which is consistent with amyloidosis. Amyloidosis is a condition in which abnormal proteins build up in the body's tissues and organs, leading to a variety of symptoms. These symptoms can vary depending on the organs that are affected. In the case of the patient, the amyloid deposits were located in the epiglottis, which is a flap of cartilage that covers the opening to the larynx (voice box). This caused the epiglottis to enlarge and narrow the airway, making it difficult for the patient to breathe.

The CT scan of the neck showed a submucosal soft-tissue mass containing few punctate calcifications centered in the epiglottis. This is a characteristic finding of amyloidosis. The other options are incorrect because they do not typically cause submucosal soft-tissue masses with punctate calcifications.

Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that can occur in the epiglottis. However, it is not typically associated with submucosal soft-tissue masses or punctate calcifications.

Lymphoma is a type of cancer that can affect the lymph nodes. However, it is not typically associated with submucosal soft-tissue masses or punctate calcifications.

Rhabdomyosarcoma is a type of cancer that can affect the skeletal muscles. However, it is not typically associated with submucosal soft-tissue masses or punctate calcifications.

Explanation:

A sigmoid sinus diverticulum is a sac-like protrusion of the sigmoid sinus, a vein that drains blood from the brain. It is a common finding, occurring in up to 20% of people. Most sigmoid sinus diverticula are asymptomatic, but they can cause symptoms such as pulsatile tinnitus, headache, and facial pain.

The patient in the case report presents with right pulsatile tinnitus that is exacerbated by holding her breath and turning her head to the left. Compression of her right neck and turning her head to the right decreases the loudness of the tinnitus. These findings are consistent with a sigmoid sinus diverticulum.

The CT temporal bone scan shows a well-defined, round, hypodense mass in the right temporal bone. This mass is located in the posterior fossa, adjacent to the sigmoid sinus. The mass is not associated with any bone erosion or soft tissue calcification. These findings are consistent with a sigmoid sinus diverticulum.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Carotid cochlear dehiscence is a rare condition in which there is a defect in the bone that separates the internal carotid artery from the cochlea, the inner ear structure that is responsible for hearing. Symptoms of carotid cochlear dehiscence include pulsatile tinnitus, hearing loss, and vertigo. The CT temporal bone scan in the case report does not show any evidence of a carotid cochlear dehiscence.
* Semicircular canal dehiscence is a rare condition in which there is a defect in the bone that separates the semicircular canals, the inner ear structures that are responsible for balance, from the middle ear. Symptoms of semicircular canal dehiscence include hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo. The CT temporal bone scan in the case report does not show any evidence of a semicircular canal dehiscence.
* Aberrant internal carotid artery is a rare condition in which the internal carotid artery, the main artery that supplies blood to the brain, takes an abnormal course. Symptoms of aberrant internal carotid artery can vary depending on the location of the anomaly. The CT temporal bone scan in the case report does not show any evidence of an aberrant internal carotid artery.

Explanation:
The patient has a history of right ear skin cancer that was excised by a dermatologist. The current presentation of a tubular neck mass along the lateral border of the SCM muscle, with MRI findings of an enhancing tubular structure along the lateral surface of the SCM muscle, is consistent with perineural spread of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.

Thrombophlebitis of the external jugular vein is a less likely diagnosis in this case, as the patient does not have any symptoms of venous thrombosis, such as fever, chills, or redness and swelling in the neck. Additionally, the MRI findings do not show any evidence of venous thrombosis.

A traumatic neuroma is a benign tumor that can develop at the site of a nerve injury. This is a less likely diagnosis in this case, as the patient does not have any history of trauma to the neck. Additionally, the MRI findings do not show any evidence of a traumatic neuroma.

A primary nerve sheath tumor is a rare tumor that can arise from the Schwann cells that myelinate nerve fibers. This is a less likely diagnosis in this case, as the patient does not have any history of cancer. Additionally, the MRI findings do not show any evidence of a primary nerve sheath tumor.

Perineural spread of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma is the most likely diagnosis in this case, given the patient's history of right ear skin cancer, the current presentation of a tubular neck mass along the lateral border of the SCM muscle, and the MRI findings of an enhancing tubular structure along the lateral surface of the SCM muscle.

Explanation:

The patient's rash is most consistent with intertrigo, a type of dermatitis that occurs in moist, skin-to-skin areas such as the armpits and groin. Intertrigo is often caused by a combination of factors, including friction, heat, and moisture. It can be exacerbated by obesity, diabetes, and poor hygiene.

The patient's history of a similar rash in his sister, who has diabetes, suggests that the patient may also have diabetes. Diabetes can increase the risk of developing intertrigo, as it can cause the skin to become dry and irritated. Additionally, diabetes can impair the body's ability to fight infection, which can lead to secondary bacterial infections in the skin.

Obtaining a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) level will help to determine the patient's blood sugar control over the past 2-3 months. An elevated HbA1C level would be consistent with diabetes. If the patient does have diabetes, it is important to manage the condition effectively to reduce the risk of complications, such as intertrigo.

Prescribing topical ketoconazole or a topical corticosteroid would not be the first-line treatment for intertrigo in a patient with diabetes. Topical ketoconazole is an antifungal medication that is used to treat fungal infections of the skin. Topical corticosteroids are used to reduce inflammation and itching. However, these medications can worsen the skin barrier function in patients with diabetes, which can increase the risk of infection.

Surgical excision is not typically indicated for the treatment of intertrigo. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to remove infected tissue or to release areas of skin that are bound together. However, surgery is usually not the first-line treatment for intertrigo.

In conclusion, the correct answer is: **B. Obtain glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) level.** This is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient's rash.

Erythema nodosum is a common, self-limited, inflammatory disorder of the skin characterized by tender, erythematous nodules on the lower extremities. It is often associated with underlying systemic diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, sarcoidosis, and infections.

The patient in the case presented with a painful eruption on his bilateral lower legs. He had a history of panhypopituitarism, septo-optic dysplasia, developmental delay, duodenal stricture, and a history of pancreatitis. He had not applied any topical medications to his legs or had recent exposure to hot tubs or fish tanks at the home. He had a history of keratosis pilaris on the lower legs and was otherwise well with no fevers, recent upper respiratory infections, abdominal pain, vomiting, or diarrhea.

Physical examination showed a man in no apparent distress. On the bilateral anterior legs were scattered tender, pink to purple nodules, and plaques. There was also a background of pinpoint folliculocentric papules on leg and thighs consistent with keratosis pilaris. There was 2+ pitting edema of the lower extremities. A punch biopsy specimen was obtained for histopathology and microbiology cultures. Routine complete blood cell count and complete metabolic panel had results within normal limits.

The histopathologic images of the biopsy specimen showed subcutaneous tissue with superficial and deep, dermal and perivascular inflammation, fibrosis, and fat necrosis. This is consistent with the diagnosis of erythema nodosum.

Lichen amyloidosis is a rare, chronic, acquired dermatosis characterized by the development of asymptomatic, hypopigmented, atrophic, keratotic, and folliculocentric papules on the trunk and extremities. The lesions are typically found in older adults, and women are more commonly affected than men. The etiology of lichen amyloidosis is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder. The lesions of lichen amyloidosis are thought to result from the deposition of amyloid protein in the papillary dermis.

The diagnosis of lichen amyloidosis is made clinically, based on the characteristic appearance of the lesions. Histopathologic examination of a biopsy specimen can confirm the diagnosis. The treatment of lichen amyloidosis is not always necessary, as the lesions are often asymptomatic. However, if the lesions are symptomatic, they can be treated with topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, or laser therapy.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not describe the clinical presentation of the patient in the case. Guttate vitiligo is characterized by the development of small, depigmented macules on the trunk and extremities. Folliculocentric lichen sclerosus et atrophicus is characterized by the development of atrophic, white papules on the genital area. Eruptive tumors of the follicular infundibulum is a rare, benign skin condition characterized by the development of small, erythematous papules on the face and neck.

Blood testing revealed an elevated creatinine level of 1.7 mg/dL (to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4), an elevated lactate level of 29.7 mg/dL (to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 0.111), an international normalized ratio of 4.6, a lowered hemoglobin level of 10.7 g/dL (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10), and a lowered hematocrit level of 27.2%; all other results were unremarkable. Given his coagulopathy, low hematocrit level, and abdominal pain, a computed tomography angiogram was performed to rule out bleeding.

The computed tomography angiogram showed gallstones in the neck of the gallbladder, high-density material within the lumen, and free intraperitoneal fluid. This finding is consistent with a diagnosis of perforated hemorrhagic calculous cholecystitis.

Perforated hemorrhagic calculous cholecystitis is a serious condition that can lead to death. It is caused by a gallstone that becomes lodged in the neck of the gallbladder and blocks the cystic duct. This blockage leads to inflammation and infection of the gallbladder, which can eventually rupture. When the gallbladder ruptures, bile and infected material leak into the abdominal cavity, causing peritonitis. Peritonitis is a life-threatening condition that can cause shock, organ failure, and death.

The treatment for perforated hemorrhagic calculous cholecystitis is surgery to remove the gallbladder. This surgery is called a cholecystectomy. In some cases, the patient may also need to have a blood transfusion to replace the blood that has been lost.

The patient in this case was diagnosed with perforated hemorrhagic calculous cholecystitis and underwent a cholecystectomy. He made a good recovery and was discharged from the hospital 5 days after surgery.

The other possible diagnoses are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms and findings. Anaphylactic shock is a severe allergic reaction that can cause shock, respiratory failure, and death. It is not caused by gallstones. Spontaneous intra-abdominal hemorrhage is a bleeding disorder that can cause shock, organ failure, and death. It is not caused by gallstones. Septic shock is a life-threatening condition that is caused by an infection. It is not caused by gallstones.

 49%|████▊     | 741/1525 [2:49:44<2:53:50, 13.30s/it]The answer is C: Subclavian steal syndrome.

Explanation:

The patient has a history of coronary artery bypass graft using the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) to the left anterior descending (LAD) in 1997, which suggests that he has atherosclerotic disease. He also reports dyspnea on exertion and left leg claudication at 23 m, which are symptoms of peripheral arterial disease (PAD). Physical examination is notable for a diminished left radial pulse, which is a sign of PAD. In 2014, he experienced angina that resolved following placement of a drug-eluting stent in his LAD, which suggests that he has coronary artery disease (CAD).

The coronary angiogram shows a normal left coronary artery (LCA) and a significant stenosis of the left subclavian artery (LSA). This stenosis is likely causing the patient's symptoms of dyspnea on exertion and left leg claudication. When the left arm is exercised, the blood flow to the arm increases. This increased blood flow can cause a decrease in blood flow to the brain, which can cause symptoms such as dizziness, lightheadedness, and syncope. This is called subclavian steal syndrome.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms. Normal coronary angiography would not explain the patient's symptoms of dyspnea on exertion and left leg claudication. Coronary steal syndrome is a rare condition that occurs when a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) steals blood flow from the native coronary artery. This is not likely in this case because the patient had a LIMA to LAD CABG, which is a very safe and effective procedure. Subclavian stenosis is a narrowing of the subclavian artery. This can cause symptoms such as arm pain, numbness, and weakness. However, it would not explain the patient's symptoms of dyspnea on exertion and left leg claudication.

Explanation:
The patient in the case presented with a 2-month history of progressive dimming vision. He was found to have a right upper lobe lung mass that was biopsy-proven to be stage III non–small-cell lung cancer. On ophthalmic examination, he had bilateral mild anterior chamber inflammation, moderate vitreous haze, and inferior vitreous condensations. The posterior pole demonstrated bilateral diffuse retinal pigment epithelial alterations with a prominent leopard spot pattern and focal choroidal pigmented lesions. Macular subretinal fluid tracked to the inferior periphery in both eyes.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is metastatic choroidal neovascularization (CNV) secondary to the patient's lung cancer. CNV is a common complication of metastatic cancer, and it can lead to significant visual loss. The treatment for metastatic CNV is pars plana vitrectomy with drainage of subretinal fluid and laser photocoagulation of the CNV.

Choroidal biopsy is not indicated in this case because the diagnosis is already known. Serial plasmapheresis is not a treatment for metastatic CNV. Bilateral external-beam radiotherapy is not a first-line treatment for metastatic CNV.

Pars plana vitrectomy is a surgical procedure that is used to remove vitreous humor from the eye. The vitreous humor is a gel-like substance that fills the space between the lens and the retina. During pars plana vitrectomy, a small incision is made in the sclera (the white of the eye) and a vitreous cutter is inserted into the eye. The vitreous cutter is used to remove the vitreous humor.

Drainage of subretinal fluid is a procedure that is used to remove subretinal fluid from the eye. Subretinal fluid is fluid that accumulates between the retina and the choroid. During drainage of subretinal fluid, a small incision is made in the sclera and a needle is inserted into the eye. The needle is used to drain the subretinal fluid.

Laser photocoagulation is a procedure that is used to destroy abnormal blood vessels. In the case of metastatic CNV, laser photocoagulation is used to destroy the abnormal blood vessels that are causing the CNV.

The combination of pars plana vitrectomy with drainage of subretinal fluid and laser photocoagulation is the most effective treatment for metastatic CNV. This treatment can help to improve visual acuity and slow the progression of the disease.

Excisional biopsy is the most definitive way to diagnose a conjunctival nodule. The nodule in this case is firm, nonvascular, and slightly mobile, which are features that are suspicious for a malignancy. A culture of the lesion was positive for Propionibacterium acnes, which is a common skin bacteria. However, this finding is not specific for a particular diagnosis, and it is possible that the bacteria could be colonizing the surface of the nodule rather than being the cause of the lesion. Testing for herpes simplex, cytomegalovirus, and Epstein-Barr virus was negative, which makes these infections less likely.

Given the clinical features of the lesion and the negative test results, it is best to perform an excisional biopsy to obtain a definitive diagnosis. This will allow the treating physician to determine the best course of treatment for the patient.

The other options are not as appropriate in this case. Option A, initiating oral colchicine therapy, is a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, but it is not a treatment for conjunctival nodules. Option B, observing with serial examinations, is a reasonable approach for some types of conjunctival nodules, but it is not appropriate for a nodule that is suspicious for a malignancy. Option D, performing intralesional dexamethasone injection, is a treatment for some types of conjunctival nodules, but it is not appropriate for a nodule that is suspicious for a malignancy.

Explanation:

The patient in this case has persistent angiographic abnormalities after intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor therapy for retinopathy of prematurity. However, there is no evidence of retinal neovascularization or recurrence of ROP. In this situation, it is appropriate to observe the patient closely and perform laser photocoagulation to areas of peripheral retinal nonperfusion only if neovascularization or recurrence of ROP develops. Administering intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor therapy again or combined intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor therapy and laser photocoagulation to areas of nonperfusion is not necessary in the absence of neovascularization or recurrence of ROP. Performing pars plana vitrectomy is a more invasive procedure that is reserved for cases of severe ROP with retinal detachment.

The patient's history and examination are consistent with a diagnosis of orbital cavernous hemangioma, a benign vascular tumor. Cavernous hemangiomas are typically asymptomatic, but they can cause symptoms such as proptosis, eyelid swelling, and vision loss. In the case of this patient, the vision loss is likely due to compression of the optic nerve by the tumor.

The next step in management is to biopsy the orbital mass to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out other possible causes of the vision loss, such as a metastasis or an inflammatory process. A biopsy can also be used to determine the extent of the tumor and to plan for treatment.

Echocardiogram and Holter monitoring are not necessary in this case because the patient does not have any symptoms or signs of cardiac disease. Hypercoagulability workup is also not necessary because there is no evidence of thromboembolism in this patient.

Observing the patient without intervention is not an appropriate management option because the patient is at risk of further vision loss. Biopsy of the orbital mass is the most appropriate next step in management.

The patient has a history of restricted movements of the left eye since birth, which was diagnosed as an orbital capillary hemangioma at 3 months of age. He was treated with oral propranolol with no improvement. On examination, he has inferior displacement of the left globe with a severe limitation of supraduction and a mild limitation of horizontal movement in the left eye. He is unable to maintain fixation with the left eye. Repeated MRI with coronal images showed massive enlargement of the superior, inferior, and medial rectus muscles. The medial rectus mass extended nasally to produce bowing of the lamina papyrecea, with no extension into adjacent structures. The enlarged extraocular muscles were hypointense on T1- and T2-weighted sequences. An abnormal curvilinear signal in the intraconal fat was isointense with muscle.

These findings are consistent with congenital fibrosis of extraocular muscles (CFEOM), a rare genetic disorder characterized by fibrosis of the extraocular muscles. CFEOM is typically diagnosed in infancy or early childhood, and it is often associated with other systemic manifestations, such as intellectual disability, seizures, and hearing loss.

The treatment of CFEOM is aimed at improving the patient's vision and cosmesis. Strabismus surgery is often performed to correct the misalignment of the eyes. In some cases, orbital decompression may be necessary to relieve pressure on the optic nerve. Genetic testing can be helpful in confirming the diagnosis of CFEOM and identifying the specific gene mutation involved. This information can be used to provide genetic counseling to the patient and their family, and it can also be used to develop new treatment strategies.

In this case, the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging findings are all consistent with CFEOM. Genetic testing would be the next step in the evaluation, as it would confirm the diagnosis and help to identify the specific gene mutation involved. This information would be useful for providing genetic counseling to the patient and their family, and it could also be used to develop new treatment strategies.

A: Investigate for systemic involvement is not the next step in this case because the patient does not have any systemic manifestations of CFEOM.

C: Strabismus surgery is an option for the treatment of CFEOM, but it is not the next step in this case because the patient has not yet been diagnosed with the disorder.

D: Orbital biopsy is not an appropriate option for the treatment of CFEOM because it would not provide any useful information.

 49%|████▉     | 747/1525 [2:50:51<2:30:17, 11.59s/it]The correct answer is D: Inject intravitreal vancomycin and administer systemic vancomycin and prednisone.

The patient has chronic inflammation after YAG capsulotomy, which is a procedure to remove a posterior capsule opacity. The patient had initial improvement after treatment with intravitreal vancomycin and ceftazidime, but the inflammation recurred. Vitreous cultures yielded 1+ Propionibacterium acnes, which is a bacterium that can cause endophthalmitis, an infection of the vitreous humor.

Endophthalmitis is a serious condition that can lead to loss of vision. The most common treatment for endophthalmitis is intravitreal injection of antibiotics. In this case, the patient should receive intravitreal vancomycin, which is an antibiotic that is effective against Propionibacterium acnes. The patient should also receive systemic vancomycin, which is an antibiotic that is given by mouth or intravenously. Systemic antibiotics are necessary to treat endophthalmitis because the infection can spread from the vitreous humor to other parts of the body.

The patient should also receive prednisone, which is a corticosteroid that is used to reduce inflammation. Prednisone can help to reduce the inflammation associated with endophthalmitis and can also help to protect the retina from damage.

A: Prescribe topical moxifloxacin and consult an infectious diseases specialist is not the correct answer because topical moxifloxacin is an antibiotic that is used to treat superficial infections of the eye. It is not effective against Propionibacterium acnes, which is the bacterium that is causing the patient's endophthalmitis. Consulting an infectious diseases specialist is a good idea, but it is not the only treatment that the patient needs.

B: Perform another vitreous tap and intravitreal vancomycin injection is not the correct answer because the patient has already had a vitreous tap and intravitreal vancomycin injection. The cultures from the previous vitreous tap yielded 1+ Propionibacterium acnes, which means that the patient still has an infection. Another vitreous tap and intravitreal vancomycin injection are unlikely to be effective because the patient has already been treated with these medications.

C: Perform intraocular lens explantation, capsulectomy, and intravitreal vancomycin injection is not the correct answer because the patient does not have an intraocular lens. Intraocular lens explantation is a procedure to remove an intraocular lens, which is a lens that is implanted in the eye to correct vision. Capsulectomy is a procedure to remove the posterior capsule of the lens, which is a thin membrane that covers the lens. Both of these procedures are only necessary if the intraocular lens is infected or if the posterior capsule is ruptured. The patient does not have an intraocular lens, so these procedures are not necessary.

Explanation:
Mycosis fungoides is a rare type of skin cancer that starts in the T cells, a type of white blood cell. It is the most common type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, accounting for about 80% of cases.

Mycosis fungoides usually starts with small, scaly patches on the skin. These patches may be itchy or painful, and they may grow slowly over time. As the disease progresses, the patches may become larger and more numerous, and they may develop into tumors.

Mycosis fungoides is a serious disease, but it is treatable. Treatment options include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and skin-directed therapies. With treatment, most people with mycosis fungoides can live long and healthy lives.

The patient in the case presented with a 2-month history of gradually worsening pruritic plaques that initially involved the scalp, face, and neck, and later affected the anterior and posterior chest wall, abdomen, upper arms, and thighs; she also had nodules over the nose and cheeks. The lesions were thought to be exfoliative dermatitis secondary to valproic acid and phenytoin, but they worsened despite changing her medication. A biopsy specimen showed dense band-like lymphoid infiltrate in the superficial dermis with mild epidermotropism. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of mycosis fungoides.

Lymphomatoid papulosis is a chronic, relapsing skin disorder that is characterized by the appearance of small, red, scaly papules. The papules may be pruritic, but they are usually not painful. The condition is most common in young adults, and it is often associated with other autoimmune disorders, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

Reactive lymphomatoid reaction secondary to drugs is a rare condition that can occur in people who are taking certain medications, such as sulfasalazine and penicillin. The condition is characterized by the appearance of skin lesions that resemble those of lymphoma. The lesions usually resolve on their own once the medication is stopped.

Adult T-cell leukemia lymphoma is a rare type of cancer that starts in the T cells, a type of white blood cell. The disease is most common in people who are infected with the human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1). Adult T-cell leukemia lymphoma can cause a variety of symptoms, including fever, fatigue, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy. The disease is often fatal.

In conclusion, the patient in the case presented with a clinical picture that is most consistent with a diagnosis of mycosis fungoides. The other possible diagnoses are less likely based on the patient's history and physical examination.

The patient is a 30-year-old man with recurrent dyspnea and palpitations. Physical examination was unremarkable, except for sinus tachycardia. Laboratory test results were all within normal limits. The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm and early repolarization changes. Thirty-day event monitoring showed sinus tachycardia during episodes of palpitation. The transthoracic echocardiogram showed a mitral valve prolapse with mild regurgitation. The left ventricular ejection fraction was between 56% and 60%. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure was 24 mm Hg. A transesophageal echocardiogram was also performed, which confirmed the findings of the transthoracic echocardiogram.

The patient's symptoms and findings are consistent with mitral valve prolapse. Mitral valve prolapse is a condition in which the mitral valve, which separates the left atrium and the left ventricle, does not close properly. This can cause blood to flow back into the left atrium, which can lead to symptoms such as palpitations, chest pain, and shortness of breath.

The management of mitral valve prolapse depends on the severity of the condition. In mild cases, such as the patient in this case, the patient may not require any treatment. However, in more severe cases, treatment may be necessary to prevent complications such as heart failure. Treatment options for mitral valve prolapse include medications, surgery, and lifestyle changes.

In the patient in this case, the mitral valve prolapse is mild and there are no signs of complications. Therefore, the best course of treatment is to manage the patient medically and perform repeated transthoracic echocardiography in 6 months. This will allow the doctor to monitor the patient's condition and make sure that the mitral valve prolapse does not worsen.

Options B, C, and D are incorrect because they are more invasive procedures that are not necessary for the patient in this case. Transcatheter balloon mitral valvuloplasty is a procedure that is used to widen a narrowed mitral valve. Surgical mitral valve repair and annuloplasty are procedures that are used to repair a mitral valve that is not closing properly. Surgical left atriotomy and membrane resection is a procedure that is used to remove a membrane that is blocking the flow of blood through the left atrium. These procedures are only necessary for patients with more severe mitral valve prolapse.

Explanation: The patient is a 3-year-old boy with a history of sleep-disordered breathing. He was found to have a nasopharyngeal mass on nasal endoscopy and magnetic resonance imaging. The mass was firm, mobile, and heterogeneously enhancing. Given the vascularity of the tumor, the boy underwent preoperative embolization with interventional radiology. He was subsequently taken to the operating room, where endoscopic resection of the mass and division of the pedicle were performed without complication. Final pathologic results demonstrated keratinizing squamous cysts and collections of ductal structures set within a myxoid stroma, with small nests of primitive mesenchyme.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of salivary gland anlage tumor. Salivary gland anlage tumors are rare, benign neoplasms that arise from remnants of embryonic salivary gland tissue. They are most commonly found in the head and neck, and typically present in children or young adults. The most common symptoms are a mass in the head or neck, pain, and facial nerve paralysis. Salivary gland anlage tumors are usually treated with surgery. The prognosis is excellent, with most patients experiencing no recurrence after surgery.

The other possible diagnoses are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Dermoid: Dermoids are benign tumors that are composed of skin and its appendages (hair, sweat glands, and sebaceous glands). They are most commonly found in the head and neck, and typically present in children. The most common symptoms are a mass in the head or neck, pain, and facial nerve paralysis. Dermoids are usually treated with surgery. The prognosis is excellent, with most patients experiencing no recurrence after surgery. However, the patient in this case does not have any symptoms of a dermoid, and the mass on magnetic resonance imaging is not consistent with a dermoid.
* Nasopharyngeal carcinoma: Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a rare, malignant neoplasm that arises from the nasopharynx. It is most common in people of Chinese descent, and typically presents in adults. The most common symptoms are a mass in the neck, headache, and epistaxis. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is usually treated with a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. The prognosis is variable, depending on the stage of the disease. However, the patient in this case is a young child, and the mass on magnetic resonance imaging is not consistent with nasopharyngeal carcinoma.
* Hemangioma: Hemangiomas are benign tumors that are composed of blood vessels. They are the most common type of tumor in infants and children, and typically regress spontaneously. The most common symptoms are a mass on the skin, bleeding, and pain. Hemangiomas are usually treated with observation or, if necessary, surgery. The prognosis is excellent, with most patients experiencing no long-term problems. However, the patient in this case does not have any symptoms of a hemangioma, and the mass on magnetic resonance imaging is not consistent with a hemangioma.

 49%|████▉     | 751/1525 [2:51:40<2:38:27, 12.28s/it]The answer is: **B. Sialolith**

Explanation:

A sialolith is a stone that forms in a salivary gland. It is the most common cause of a hard swelling in the inner cheek. Sialoliths are usually caused by a blockage of the salivary gland duct. This blockage can be caused by infection, inflammation, or a foreign object.

Sialoliths are often asymptomatic. However, they can cause pain, swelling, and infection. If a sialolith is infected, it can cause fever, chills, and difficulty opening the mouth.

Sialoliths are diagnosed with a physical examination and imaging tests, such as an X-ray or CT scan. Treatment for sialoliths depends on the size and location of the stone. Small stones may pass on their own. Larger stones may need to be removed by a doctor.

A mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a type of cancer that starts in the mucous glands. It is the most common type of salivary gland cancer. Mucoepidermoid carcinomas are usually slow-growing and have a good prognosis. However, they can be aggressive if they are not treated early.

A lipoma is a type of fatty tumor that can grow anywhere in the body, including the mouth. Lipomas are usually benign, but they can sometimes become cancerous.

A mucocele is a type of cyst that can form in the salivary glands. It is caused by a blockage of the salivary gland duct. Mucoceles are usually small and painless. However, they can grow large and cause pain.

In this case, the patient has a hard swelling on the inner cheek that is associated with pain and recent trauma. This is most consistent with a diagnosis of sialolith. The other options are less likely because they do not typically cause pain or swelling after trauma.

Pleomorphic adenomas are the most common type of benign tumor of the salivary glands. They are typically slow-growing and painless, and can occur in any of the salivary glands. The most common symptom is a painless mass in the affected area. On imaging, pleomorphic adenomas are typically well-circumscribed and hypodense. On histopathology, they are composed of a mixture of epithelial and mesenchymal elements. Treatment is surgical excision.

In this case, the patient is a woman in her 30s with a history of bruxism and long-term use of a bite guard. She presented with pain centering on left submandibular area for 2 years. She was initially prescribed a muscle relaxant without notable improvement. Physical examination revealed a mild firmness in the left submandibular area. The mucosa of the oral cavity and floor of mouth was normal. Cranial nerve function, including tongue mobility and sensation, was also normal. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a 1.7 × 1.5 × 1.4-cm mass, adjacent to the left submandibular gland. Scattered, nonenlarged lymph nodes were observed. An ultrasonography-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy was nondiagnostic owing to an inability to obtain sufficient tissue. The patient underwent surgical exploration with left submandibular gland excision and resection of the left submandibular mass. Histopathologic findings showed spindle cell neoplasm with morphologic features and no malignant neoplasm identified. Results from immunohistochemical analysis were positive for S100 and negative for smooth muscle actin, CD34, and pankeratin.

Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is submandibular gland pleomorphic adenoma. This is supported by the patient's history of bruxism, which is a risk factor for the development of pleomorphic adenomas. The mass is located in the submandibular gland, which is the most common site for pleomorphic adenomas. The mass is well-circumscribed and hypodense on imaging, which are typical features of pleomorphic adenomas. The histopathologic findings show a spindle cell neoplasm with morphologic features, which is consistent with a pleomorphic adenoma. The results of immunohistochemical analysis are also consistent with a pleomorphic adenoma, as they are positive for S100 and negative for smooth muscle actin, CD34, and pankeratin.

The other possible diagnoses are not as likely. Chronic lymphadenitis is a common condition that can cause lymph nodes to enlarge. However, it is not typically associated with pain or a mass in the submandibular area. Hypoglossal nerve schwannoma is a rare tumor that can arise from the hypoglossal nerve. It is typically associated with weakness or paralysis of the tongue. Chronic submandibular sialadenitis is a chronic inflammation of the submandibular gland. It is typically associated with pain, swelling, and tenderness in the submandibular area.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis in this case is submandibular gland pleomorphic adenoma.

Explanation:

The patient is a male smoker in his 60s who presented with a right supraclavicular cutaneous mass that had persisted for 2 years. This mass underwent progressive growth during the first year but subsequently stabilized. Despite causing occasional pruritus, the lesion was otherwise asymptomatic. A shave biopsy specimen revealed islands of large epithelioid cells with increased mitotic index surrounded by a dense lymphocytic infiltrate. The tumor cells expressed p16 and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), p63, and CK903, and were negative for prostate-specific antigen, CDX2, thyroid transcription factor 1, S-100, chromogranin, synaptophysin, and CD56. In situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) was negative.

The differential diagnosis for a cutaneous mass in a male smoker includes a number of neoplasms, including metastatic carcinoma, melanoma, and lymphoma. The presence of a dense lymphocytic infiltrate in the biopsy specimen, as well as the expression of p16 and EMA, is suggestive of a lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma. Lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma is a rare type of carcinoma that is typically associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection. It is most commonly seen in the nasopharynx, but can also occur in other sites, including the skin. The treatment of lymphoepithelioma-like carcinoma is typically surgical excision, with or without radiation therapy.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma: This is a less likely diagnosis given the patient's age and the lack of other clinical features suggestive of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, such as nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and hearing loss.
* Melanoma: This is a less likely diagnosis given the patient's age and the absence of other clinical features suggestive of melanoma, such as a history of sun exposure, a family history of melanoma, and an atypical mole.
* Cutaneous lymphadenoma: This is a less likely diagnosis given the patient's age and the presence of a dense lymphocytic infiltrate in the biopsy specimen.

Explanation:

The patient has been diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) based on her symptoms and the results of her esophageal physiologic testing. She has failed to respond to treatment with a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and famotidine. The next step in management is to try a different class of medication, such as a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). Nortriptyline is a TCA that has been shown to be effective in the treatment of GERD. It works by decreasing the production of stomach acid.

Increasing the dose of esomeprazole or adding a second PPI is not likely to be effective, as the patient has already failed to respond to treatment with a PPI. A barium esophagogram is not necessary, as the patient has already had an EGD which was normal. Referral to a surgeon for antireflux surgery is premature, as the patient has not yet failed to respond to medical therapy.

 50%|████▉     | 755/1525 [2:52:37<2:54:56, 13.63s/it]The correct answer is: B. Obtain a biopsy of the nodule.

A biopsy is the removal of a small piece of tissue for examination under a microscope. It is the only way to confirm a diagnosis of cancer. The nodule in this case is concerning for malignancy because it is firm, irregularly shaped, and multilobulated. It is also ulcerated and has a friable yellow-red plaque. These features are all suggestive of malignancy.

A swab and culture may be useful to identify any infectious organisms that may be present, but it will not provide a definitive diagnosis of cancer. Topical steroids are not indicated for a peristomal nodule, as they may mask the underlying condition and make it difficult to diagnose. Wound care for barrier protection may be helpful to protect the skin around the stoma, but it will not treat the underlying condition.

Therefore, the best course of action is to obtain a biopsy of the nodule to confirm a diagnosis of cancer and to determine the best course of treatment.

Explanation:

Annular lichenoid dermatitis of youth (ALDY) is a chronic, relapsing, and self-limiting skin disease characterized by annular or polycyclic, erythematous, scaly patches that typically occur on the trunk and extremities of children and young adults. The etiology of ALDY is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder.

The clinical presentation of ALDY is variable, but the most common findings are annular or polycyclic, erythematous, scaly patches that typically occur on the trunk and extremities. The lesions may be pruritic, but they are usually not painful. The diagnosis of ALDY is made based on clinical findings and a skin biopsy. The histopathologic findings in ALDY are characteristic, with a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate in the papillary dermis and vacuolar changes at the dermoepidermal junction.

The treatment of ALDY is generally supportive, with emollients and topical corticosteroids to relieve itching and inflammation. In some cases, systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents may be necessary. The prognosis for ALDY is good, with most patients experiencing spontaneous resolution of the lesions within a few months to a year.

The other options are incorrect because they do not fit the clinical presentation of the patient in the case. Pigmented purpuric dermatosis is a disorder characterized by purpuric macules and papules on the lower extremities. Mycosis fungoides is a type of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma that typically presents with patches or plaques of erythema on the skin. Secondary syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection that can cause a variety of skin lesions, including annular lesions.

Explanation:

The patient presented with a 6-month history of a nonhealing ulcer and multiple indurated plaques on the legs. The first lesion appeared as an erythematous papule, which grew and subsequently ulcerated. Within a few months, she developed other indurated plaques on her legs. The ulcer was painful on palpation, but the plaques were mostly asymptomatic. The patient did not have fevers, chills, weight loss, dyspnea, chest pain, cough, or hemoptysis. She had moved to Canada from China 30 years ago and was unsure about tuberculosis (TB) exposure and Bacillus Calmette–Guérin vaccine status. Her medical history included atrial fibrillation, type 2 diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, and Parkinson disease. Physical examination showed a 5 × 4-cm, well-demarcated, oval ulcer with a violaceous, dusky border and central yellow fibrin mixed with granulation tissue on the left lateral aspect of the calf. There were numerous violaceous to dull red, indurated plaques on the posterior aspect of the legs. Wound cultures were negative for bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi.

The most likely diagnosis is erythema induratum, a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory condition of the subcutaneous fat. It is characterized by the development of indurated plaques on the lower legs, often in association with deep venous thrombosis (DVT). The plaques are usually violaceous or dusky red in color and may ulcerate. Erythema induratum is most common in women, especially those with a history of obesity, diabetes, or DVT. The exact cause of erythema induratum is unknown, but it is thought to be an immune-mediated disorder. Treatment is typically with corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents.

The other possible diagnoses are not as likely in this case. Infective panniculitides are a group of disorders that cause inflammation of the subcutaneous fat. They can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or parasites. The most common infective panniculitis is cellulitis, which is characterized by the development of tender, erythematous skin with fever and chills. Erythema nodosum is a non-infectious inflammatory disorder that typically affects the lower legs. It is characterized by the development of tender, erythematous nodules that often resolve within a few weeks. Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare, chronic, inflammatory skin disorder that can cause ulceration of the skin. It is often associated with underlying systemic diseases, such as Crohn disease or rheumatoid arthritis.

Explanation:
Prurigo pigmentosa is a chronic, pruritic, papular eruption that typically affects young adults. It is characterized by the presence of discrete, erythematous, scaly papules that often coalesce to form reticulated patches. The eruption is typically located on the trunk and extremities, and it may be associated with severe pruritus. The pathogenesis of prurigo pigmentosa is unknown, but it is thought to be a reaction to an underlying inflammatory process. There is no cure for prurigo pigmentosa, but the symptoms can be managed with topical corticosteroids and antihistamines.

In the case described above, the patient presents with a 6-year history of recurrent, pruritic skin eruptions involving the middle and lower back. She has been treated with potent topical corticosteroids and oral prednisone, with no improvement. She denies use of heating pads, space heaters, or other forms of external radiation. Physical examination shows several discrete, erythematous, scaly papules admixed with light brown reticulated macules and patches. Punch biopsy specimens show eosinophilic spongiosis with interface dermatitis, dyskeratosis, and neutrophilic exocytosis. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of prurigo pigmentosa.

The other possible diagnoses can be excluded based on the following information:

* Erythema ab igne is a localized, erythematous, and hyperpigmented eruption that is caused by prolonged exposure to heat. It is typically seen in elderly people who use heating pads or space heaters. The patient in the case described above does not use heating pads or space heaters, and her eruption is not localized to an area of skin that has been exposed to heat.
* Dowling-Degos disease is a rare, chronic, progressive dermatosis that is characterized by the development of hyperpigmented, reticulated macules and patches. It is typically seen in middle-aged and elderly people. The patient in the case described above is young, and her eruption does not have the characteristic reticulated pattern of Dowling-Degos disease.
* Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis is a rare, chronic, papular eruption that is characterized by the development of confluent, reticulated, papillomatous lesions. It is typically seen in young adults. The patient in the case described above does not have the characteristic papular lesions of confluent and reticulated papillomatosis.

 50%|████▉     | 759/1525 [2:53:25<2:40:46, 12.59s/it]The answer is A. Glioma.

A glioma is a type of brain tumor that starts in the glial cells, which support and protect nerve cells. Gliomas are the most common type of primary brain tumor, meaning they start in the brain itself.

Gliomas can be classified into four main types: astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas, ependymomas, and mixed gliomas. Astrocytomas are the most common type of glioma, and they can be further divided into low-grade and high-grade astrocytomas. Low-grade astrocytomas grow slowly and are less likely to spread to other parts of the brain. High-grade astrocytomas grow more quickly and are more likely to spread to other parts of the brain.

Oligodendrogliomas are less common than astrocytomas, and they tend to grow more slowly. Ependymomas are rare, and they usually start in the lining of the ventricles, which are the fluid-filled spaces in the brain. Mixed gliomas are a combination of two or more types of glioma.

The symptoms of a glioma can vary depending on the size and location of the tumor. Common symptoms include headache, seizures, weakness, numbness, and vision problems.

The treatment for a glioma depends on the type, size, and location of the tumor. Treatment options may include surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

In the case of the adolescent boy in the question, the most likely diagnosis is a glioma. The patient presented with cognitive and behavioral changes, headaches, and progressively worsening weakness of the left arm and leg. These symptoms are consistent with a glioma. The MRI findings of a suspicious lesion in the right basal ganglia, which is a part of the brain that controls movement, is also consistent with a glioma.

The other possible diagnoses, infarction, germinoma, and demyelination, are less likely. Infarction is a blockage of blood flow to the brain, which can cause stroke. Germinoma is a rare type of brain tumor that starts in germ cells, which are the cells that produce sperm or eggs. Demyelination is a condition in which the myelin sheath, which protects nerve cells, is damaged.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for the adolescent boy in the question is a glioma. The patient's symptoms and MRI findings are consistent with a glioma. The other possible diagnoses, infarction, germinoma, and demyelination, are less likely.

The child and his father demonstrate a lateral displacement of the inner canthi, which is a characteristic feature of Waardenburg syndrome type 1. Other features of Waardenburg syndrome type 1 include dystopia canthorum (lateral displacement of the inner canthi), heterochromia iridis (different colored irises), white forelock, and hearing loss. In the child, the hearing loss is not present, but this may be due to the fact that he is still young. The father has hearing loss, which is consistent with Waardenburg syndrome type 1.

Stickler syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the connective tissue. It can cause hearing loss, vision problems, skeletal abnormalities, and joint problems. The child in this case does not have any of the other features of Stickler syndrome, so it is not the correct diagnosis.

X-linked Alport syndrome is a genetic disorder that affects the kidneys. It can cause kidney failure, hearing loss, and eye problems. The child in this case does not have any of the other features of X-linked Alport syndrome, so it is not the correct diagnosis.

Autosomal dominant GJB2 gene mutation is a genetic disorder that affects the inner ear. It can cause hearing loss. The child in this case does not have any of the other features of autosomal dominant GJB2 gene mutation, so it is not the correct diagnosis.

Explanation: The patient has a history of ulcerative colitis, which is a chronic inflammatory disease of the colon. She was recently discharged from the hospital for a flare of her UC, which was managed with prednisone. She is now presenting with lower abdominal pain, diarrhea, and tenderness to palpation in the left lower quadrant. Her complete blood cell count and comprehensive metabolic panel results are unremarkable. Computed tomographic scan of the abdomen/pelvis demonstrates a thickened colon from the middescending colon to the rectosigmoid. There is also a 2.7-cm intramural abscess in the descending colon. These findings are consistent with a flare of ulcerative colitis.

Conversion to Crohn disease is a rare complication of ulcerative colitis. It is characterized by the development of new inflammatory lesions in the small intestine, in addition to the colon. This patient does not have any symptoms or findings consistent with Crohn disease.

Adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer that can develop in the colon. It is more common in patients with ulcerative colitis, but this patient does not have any symptoms or findings consistent with cancer.

Lymphoma is a type of cancer that can develop in the lymph nodes. It is not associated with ulcerative colitis.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a flare of ulcerative colitis.

Explanation:
The patient has multiple yellow-white subretinal lesions with associated hemorrhages and vitritis in the left eye. These findings are consistent with fungal endophthalmitis, which is a sight-threatening infection of the eye. The most common cause of fungal endophthalmitis in patients with leukemia is Candida.

The treatment of fungal endophthalmitis is vitrectomy with subretinal biopsy and intravitreal antifungal injection. Vitrectomy is a surgical procedure in which a small incision is made in the eye and the vitreous humor (the clear gel that fills the inside of the eye) is removed. The subretinal biopsy is a procedure in which a small piece of tissue is taken from under the retina. The intravitreal antifungal injection is an injection of antifungal medication into the vitreous humor.

In this case, the patient is already receiving systemic antifungals (amphotericin B) for his skin infection. However, systemic antifungals are not effective in treating fungal endophthalmitis. Vitrectomy with subretinal biopsy and intravitreal antifungal injection are the only effective treatments for fungal endophthalmitis.

The other answers are incorrect because they are not the standard of care for fungal endophthalmitis. Vitreous tap and inject is not a standard treatment for fungal endophthalmitis. Change systemic antimicrobials is not a standard treatment for fungal endophthalmitis. Perform lumbar puncture is not a standard treatment for fungal endophthalmitis.

Explanation:
The patient has an intraorbital foreign body, which is a potentially sight-threatening condition. The foreign body should be removed as soon as possible to prevent infection, inflammation, and damage to the optic nerve. The patient also has canalicular lacerations, which should be repaired to prevent infection and to restore tear drainage. The best course of action is to repair the canalicular lacerations and then perform an orbitotomy to remove the foreign body.

A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study is not necessary in this case, as it would not provide any additional information that would change the management of the patient. Observation is also not an appropriate management option, as it would allow the foreign body to remain in place and potentially cause further damage to the eye. Repairing the canalicular lacerations without removing the foreign body would also be a mistake, as it would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

The patient is a young woman with no history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, or smoking. Her only medication is oral contraception (OCP). She presents with acute monocular vision loss in the left eye. The fundus examination of the left eye shows tortuosity and dilation of all branches of the retinal vein, disc edema, scattered intraretinal hemorrhages, and nasal macula nerve fiber layer infarcts. The vitreous is clear, macula flat, and there is no retinal neovascularization. Results of optical coherence tomography confirmed the absence of cystoid macular edema and demonstrated nerve fiber layer thickening and hyperreflectivity, consistent with a nerve fiber layer infarct.

The differential diagnosis for this patient's presentation includes retinal vein occlusion, central retinal artery occlusion, optic neuritis, and anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Retinal vein occlusion is the most likely diagnosis in this patient, given the history of blurred vision in the left eye that she noticed on waking, the fundus examination findings, and the results of optical coherence tomography.

The management of retinal vein occlusion depends on the type of occlusion and the severity of the visual loss. For patients with nonischemic retinal vein occlusion, treatment is typically aimed at reducing intraocular pressure and preventing the development of complications, such as neovascularization. For patients with ischemic retinal vein occlusion, treatment is typically aimed at improving vision and preventing further visual loss.

In this patient, the next step in management is to review her medical and family history for hypercoagulable or inflammatory systemic diseases. These conditions can increase the risk of retinal vein occlusion. If the patient has a history of one of these conditions, further testing may be necessary to determine the underlying cause of the occlusion. Treatment will then be aimed at managing the underlying condition and preventing further visual loss.

A, B, and D are incorrect because they are not the next steps in management for this patient. Intravitreal corticosteroid injection and intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor injection are treatments that are used for patients with retinal vein occlusion, but they are not appropriate for this patient because she has no evidence of neovascularization. Panretinal photocoagulation is a treatment that is used for patients with diabetic retinopathy, but it is not appropriate for this patient because she does not have diabetes.

The patient's presentation is consistent with uveitis, a condition that can be caused by a variety of factors, including infection, autoimmune disease, and trauma. In this case, the patient's history of cigarette use and alcohol dependence, as well as the presence of pulmonary nodules, suggest that the uveitis may be due to tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection that can cause a variety of symptoms, including fever, night sweats, and weight loss. It can also spread to other parts of the body, including the eyes.

The gold standard for diagnosing tuberculosis is sputum culture, but in this case the results were negative. This is not uncommon, as tuberculosis can be difficult to culture. The interferon γ release assay (QuantiFERON-TB gold) is a more sensitive test for tuberculosis, and it was positive in this case. This finding, along with the patient's clinical presentation, strongly suggests that the patient has tuberculosis.

The treatment for tuberculosis is a combination of four medications: rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol. This combination is known as RIPE therapy. RIPE therapy is very effective in treating tuberculosis, and it is important to complete the full course of treatment, even if the patient begins to feel better.

A, B, and D are incorrect because they are not the standard of care for treating tuberculosis uveitis. An incisional biopsy is not necessary to diagnose tuberculosis, and it can actually increase the risk of spreading the infection. Oral prednisone is a steroid medication that can be used to treat inflammation, but it is not the first-line treatment for tuberculosis. Injecting sub-Tenon triamcinolone is a procedure that is used to treat inflammation in the eye, but it is not effective in treating tuberculosis.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C: Initiate rifampin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol (RIPE) therapy.

Explanation:

The patient is a young man with a history of a small mass in the right scrotum that was evaluated 5 years previously and was reassured to be a nonmalignant lesion. He now presents with a 2-month history of vague, right upper-quadrant abdominal pain, with associated 5-kg weight loss, loss of appetite, and increasing abdominal distension. Physical examination reveals a distended abdomen with a palpable left abdominal mass. Testicular examination reveals an approximately 1-cm firm right spermatic cord nodule. Laboratory tests show lactate dehydrogenase levels of 818 U/L, with no significant β-human chorionic gonadotropin and α-fetoprotein levels. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen reveals innumerable masses throughout the abdomen and pelvis, with the largest measuring 17.5 × 14 × 14 cm and a 3.9-cm enhancing lesion in the left hepatic lobe, and a small amount of ascites. Testicular sonogram discloses a 1.5-cm right epididymal cyst. Percutaneous biopsy and histologic examination of the dominant left abdominal mass reveal neoplastic cells that are positive for cytokeratin, desmin but negative for S100. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is positive for EWS-WT1 rearrangement.

The constellation of findings in this patient is most consistent with metastatic testicular carcinoma. The patient is a young man with a history of a testicular mass that was initially thought to be benign. He now presents with disseminated disease, as evidenced by the multiple abdominal masses and liver metastasis. The CT scan findings are also consistent with metastatic testicular carcinoma, as is the positive FISH for EWS-WT1 rearrangement.

Metastatic neuroendocrine carcinoma, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, and advanced desmoplastic small round cell tumor are all possible diagnoses in this patient. However, the history, physical examination, laboratory tests, imaging findings, and pathologic findings are most consistent with metastatic testicular carcinoma.

Explanation:

The patient in this case has a history of sudden cardiac death in her family, as well as palpitations, breathlessness, chest pain, and episodes of light-headedness. Her physical examination and electrocardiogram are normal, but her 24-hour Holter monitor trace shows ventricular tachycardia. Given this history and presentation, it is important to determine the frequency of the ventricular tachycardia in order to assess the risk of sudden cardiac death. The best way to do this is to implant a device that will monitor the patient's heart rhythm continuously. This is a relatively safe and minimally invasive procedure that can provide valuable information about the patient's risk of sudden cardiac death.

Conducting an invasive electrophysiological study would not be the best next step in this case, as it is not as accurate as implanting a device to monitor the heart rhythm continuously. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and cardiac positron emission tomography are not indicated in this case, as they would not provide any additional information about the patient's risk of sudden cardiac death.

Explanation:
The patient is a healthy man in his 40s with a giant, left-sided neck mass that has been present for 12 months. The mass is ovoid and bilobulated, with fibrous septae in the central and inferior parts. It is located in the left lateral region of the neck and extends to the supraclavicular region. The mass is displacing the surrounding musculature and vascular structures but does not appear to be invading them. The patient has no history of neck trauma or infection.

The imaging findings are consistent with a branchial cleft cyst. Branchial cleft cysts are the most common congenital neck masses, accounting for approximately 70% of all such masses. They are thought to arise from abnormal development of the branchial arches, which are structures that form in the embryo and give rise to the face, neck, and upper respiratory tract. Branchial cleft cysts can occur anywhere along the line of the branchial arches, from the base of the skull to the supraclavicular fossa. They are most commonly located in the anterior triangle of the neck, just below the angle of the mandible.

Branchial cleft cysts are usually asymptomatic and are discovered incidentally on physical examination. However, they can become large and symptomatic, causing pain, dyspnea, and neck swelling. The diagnosis is usually made on imaging studies, such as ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

The treatment of branchial cleft cysts is surgical excision. This is usually a straightforward procedure that can be performed under local anesthesia. The cyst is removed in its entirety, with care taken to avoid injury to the surrounding structures. The prognosis for patients with branchial cleft cysts is excellent. The vast majority of patients have a good outcome after surgery, with no recurrence of the cyst.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Glomus tumor: Glomus tumors are rare, benign tumors that arise from the glomus bodies, which are small, specialized sensory organs that are found in the skin and other tissues. Glomus tumors are most commonly located in the hands and feet, but they can also occur in the head and neck. They are typically small, painful masses that are often blue or purple in color. The diagnosis is usually made on imaging studies, such as CT or MRI. Treatment is surgical excision.
* Liposarcoma: Liposarcoma is a rare, malignant tumor that arises from fat cells. It is the most common type of soft tissue sarcoma. Liposarcomas can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the abdomen and retroperitoneum. They are typically large, soft masses that are often painless. The diagnosis is usually made on imaging studies, such as CT or MRI. Treatment is surgical excision, followed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy.
* Cervical lymphatic malformation: Cervical lymphatic malformations are congenital anomalies of the lymphatic system. They are typically present at birth and can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the head and neck. They can be classified as simple lymphatic malformations, which are small, unilocular cysts, or complex lymphatic malformations, which are larger, multilocular cysts with internal septae. The diagnosis is usually made on imaging studies, such as ultrasound, CT, or MRI. Treatment is surgical excision.

Mycobacterial abscess is the most likely diagnosis in this patient because she has a history of cystic fibrosis, which is a risk factor for mycobacterial infection. She also underwent bilateral endoscopic sinus surgery and medial maxillectomy 4 months after bilateral lung transplantation, which would have made her more susceptible to infection. The clinical presentation of mycobacterial abscess is consistent with the patient's symptoms, including throat pain, swelling, and purulent drainage. The radiographic findings of a rim-enhancing, multilocular hypodense collection extending from the left nasopharynx inferiorly to the level of the right palatine tonsil are also consistent with mycobacterial abscess.

Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a rare complication of solid organ transplantation that can occur in up to 10% of patients. PTLD is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that typically presents with fever, lymphadenopathy, and organomegaly. The patient in this case does not have any of the typical symptoms of PTLD, and her radiographic findings are not consistent with PTLD.

Acute invasive fungal sinusitis is a rare but serious infection that can occur in patients with underlying medical conditions, such as cystic fibrosis. Acute invasive fungal sinusitis typically presents with fever, facial pain, and purulent drainage. The patient in this case does not have any of the typical symptoms of acute invasive fungal sinusitis, and her radiographic findings are not consistent with acute invasive fungal sinusitis.

Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a rare cancer that occurs in the nasopharynx. Nasopharyngeal carcinoma typically presents with unilateral nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and otalgia. The patient in this case does not have any of the typical symptoms of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and her radiographic findings are not consistent with nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is mycobacterial abscess.

Explanation:

Florid osseous dysplasia is a rare, benign bone disorder characterized by the formation of multiple, well-demarcated, radiopaque lesions in the craniofacial bones. The lesions are typically asymptomatic and are discovered incidentally on imaging studies. However, they can occasionally cause symptoms such as facial asymmetry, exophthalmos, and dental malocclusion.

The diagnosis of florid osseous dysplasia is made based on clinical and radiographic findings. The lesions are typically seen on CT scans as well-defined, round or oval, radiopaque masses. There is no specific treatment for florid osseous dysplasia, and the lesions typically remain stable over time. However, surgery may be considered if the lesions are causing symptoms.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Paget disease of bone is a chronic, progressive disease characterized by the replacement of normal bone with abnormal bone. The lesions in Paget disease of bone are typically lytic, or radiolucent, on imaging studies.
* Fibrous dysplasia is a non-neoplastic, fibro-osseous lesion characterized by the replacement of normal bone with fibrous tissue and abnormal bone. The lesions in fibrous dysplasia can be either lytic or sclerotic, or mixed, on imaging studies.
* Gardner syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple polyps in the colon and other parts of the gastrointestinal tract. Patients with Gardner syndrome are also at an increased risk of developing other tumors, including osteomas, desmoid tumors, and medulloblastomas.

Explanation:

The patient is a young boy with a 2-week history of left facial and eye pain with intermittent diplopia on upward and lateral gaze. He was otherwise healthy and exhibited no constitutional complaints. His remaining medical, surgical, family, and social history was noncontributory. Examination showed a healthy-appearing child with left abducens nerve palsy and an afferent pupillary defect. There was no chemosis, exophthalmos, or enophthalmos. Findings from nasal endoscopy were unremarkable. A computed tomographic scan of the sinuses without contrast showed a well-circumscribed posterior-medial extraconal mass extending into the orbital apex with smooth, nonaggressive bony remodeling and expansion of the left superior orbital fissure with further dorsal extension into the left cavernous sinus. Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits showed that orbital component was inseparable from medial rectus muscle. Tumor also resulted in lateral displacement and compression of the left optic nerve. The patient underwent an image-guided left endoscopic orbital decompression with biopsy of the orbital mass. Representative hematoxylin-eosin–stained sections are shown in the Figure, C and D. The tumor was negative for FUS (FUsed in Sarcoma; also termed TLS, Translocated in LipoSarcoma)-CHOP (C/EBP HOmologous Protein; also termed DDIT3, DNA Damage-Inducible Transcript 3) fusion oncogene on fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH).

A lipoblastoma is a benign tumor of adipose tissue that typically occurs in children. It is most commonly found in the extremities, but can also occur in the trunk and head and neck. Lipoblastomas are usually well-circumscribed and non-aggressive, and they rarely metastasize.

The patient in this case presents with a typical history and physical examination for a lipoblastoma. The CT scan and MRI findings are also consistent with a lipoblastoma. The negative FUS-CHOP fusion oncogene test further supports the diagnosis of a lipoblastoma.

The other options are incorrect because they are not typically seen in children. Liposarcoma is a malignant tumor of adipose tissue that can occur at any age, but it is more common in adults. Teratoma is a germ cell tumor that can contain a variety of tissues, including adipose tissue. It is most commonly found in the ovaries and testes, but it can also occur in the head and neck.

The patient has a history of a pyogenic granuloma, which is a benign skin lesion that can be caused by a variety of factors, including infection. The patient's current presentation, with a tender ulcerated nodule encompassing the nail bed with near-complete nail loss and purulent drainage, is concerning for a possible infection. Performing tissue culture for bacterial and fungal organisms will help to identify the specific organism(s) that are causing the infection, so that appropriate treatment can be given.

The other options are not as appropriate in this case. Cryotherapy is a treatment that can be used to freeze and destroy skin lesions, but it is not the best treatment for an infection. Immunohistochemical analysis is a test that can be used to identify specific proteins in tissue, but it is not necessary in this case because the diagnosis of pyogenic granuloma is already known. Reassurance is not a necessary or appropriate treatment in this case, as the patient has a significant clinical presentation that requires further evaluation and treatment.

Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a serious adverse reaction to heparin therapy that can lead to life-threatening thrombosis. It is caused by the formation of antibodies against heparin-platelet factor 4 (PF4) complexes. These complexes bind to platelets and activate them, leading to platelet aggregation and thrombus formation.

The diagnosis of HIT is based on a history of heparin exposure, a decline in platelet count of 50% or more from baseline, and the presence of anti-PF4 antibodies. Treatment of HIT involves discontinuing heparin and starting alternative anticoagulation therapy. Argatroban is a direct thrombin inhibitor that is effective in treating HIT.

In this case, the patient has a history of heparin exposure, a decline in platelet count of 50% or more from baseline, and the presence of anti-PF4 antibodies. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of HIT. Therefore, the appropriate treatment is to discontinue heparin and start alternative anticoagulation therapy with argatroban.

The other options are incorrect. Option A is incorrect because continuing heparin in the setting of HIT can lead to life-threatening thrombosis. Option C is incorrect because antibiotic-induced thrombocytopenia is a different condition than HIT. Option D is incorrect because transfusing platelets is not indicated in the setting of HIT.

Explanation:

* The patient is a middle-aged man from India, which is a region where leprosy is endemic.
* The patient has a painful nonhealing foot ulcer of 1-year duration. This is a classic presentation of leprosy.
* The patient has multiple hypopigmented asymptomatic lesions on his face and scalp. These lesions are characteristic of leprosy.
* The patient was previously treated with multidrug therapy for leprosy, but there was no appreciable clinical improvement. This suggests that the patient has a multibacillary form of leprosy, which is more resistant to treatment.
* The skin punch biopsy specimens showed acute ulceration of the epidermis with granulation tissue and infiltrating neutrophils and macrophages. This is consistent with a diagnosis of leprosy.
* The histologic analysis showed intracellular and extracellular inclusion bodies. These inclusion bodies are characteristic of Mycobacterium leprae, the bacterium that causes leprosy.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is borderline lepromatous leprosy with trophic ulcer.

B. Tropical phagedenic ulcer is an ulcerative skin condition that is caused by infection with a bacterium called Fusobacterium necrophorum. It is characterized by a rapidly spreading, painful ulcer with undermined edges. The patient in this case does not have any of the characteristic features of tropical phagedenic ulcer, such as a rapidly spreading ulcer or undermined edges.

C. Post–kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis is a skin condition that is caused by infection with a parasite called Leishmania donovani. It is characterized by multiple, well-defined, hypopigmented macules or papules. The patient in this case does not have any of the characteristic features of post–kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis.

D. Cutaneous diphtheria is a skin condition that is caused by infection with a bacterium called Corynebacterium diphtheriae. It is characterized by a painful, erythematous papule or vesicle that progresses to a necrotic ulcer. The patient in this case does not have any of the characteristic features of cutaneous diphtheria.

Explanation:
Cutaneous collagenous vasculopathy is a rare, idiopathic, small vessel vasculopathy characterized by hyaline deposits within the papillary dermis. It typically presents as a single or multiple, well-demarcated, erythematous, scaly plaques on the lower extremities. The lesions are often associated with telangiectasias and may be pruritic. The diagnosis is made by biopsy, which shows concentric deposits of hyaline material surrounding dilated and markedly thickened capillaries within the papillary dermis. The course of the disease is variable, with some patients experiencing spontaneous resolution while others have persistent or recurrent lesions. There is no specific treatment for cutaneous collagenous vasculopathy, but topical corticosteroids or calcineurin inhibitors may be helpful in some cases.

The other options are incorrect because they do not fit the clinical presentation of the patient. Essential telangiectasia is a common, benign condition characterized by the development of small, dilated blood vessels on the skin. It is typically seen on the face, hands, and feet. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is a type of vasculitis that is characterized by inflammation and necrosis of small blood vessels. It typically presents with purpura, petechiae, and ecchymosis. Pigmented purpuric dermatosis, Schamberg type is a chronic, relapsing skin condition characterized by the development of small, pigmented purpuric macules on the lower extremities. It is often associated with a history of venous insufficiency.

Explanation:
A brown tumor is a localized area of bone resorption that occurs in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. It is caused by the increased activity of osteoclasts, which are cells that break down bone. Brown tumors are typically found in the mandible, ribs, and long bones. They are usually asymptomatic, but they can cause pain, swelling, and tenderness. The diagnosis is made based on the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging studies. Treatment is aimed at the underlying cause of the hyperparathyroidism, which is usually surgical removal of one or more parathyroid glands.

In this case, the patient has a history of primary hyperparathyroidism, which is a known cause of brown tumors. The patient also has laboratory findings consistent with hyperparathyroidism, including hypercalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and elevated serum parathyroid hormone levels. Radiography of the patient's finger shows complete lysis of the underlying phalanx and periosteal bone resorption in the phalangeal tuft band. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of brown tumor.

Giant cell tumor, giant cell granuloma, and chondromyxoid fibroma are all benign tumors that can occur in bone. However, they are not associated with primary hyperparathyroidism. Therefore, these diagnoses are less likely in this case.

Explanation:
The patient is a 6-year-old boy who presented to the emergency department after experiencing a bicycle handlebar injury. He complained about abdominal pain and had vomited twice. At physical examination, he had normal vitals results with pain during palpation of the left abdominal region without guarding. His hemoglobin level was 12.3 g/dL, amylase 68 U/L, and lipase 25 U/L. A plain chest radiography result showed no signs of traumatic injury. Abdominal ultrasonography results showed a bowel loop with a thickened wall in the left abdominal region with no free abdominal fluid. He was admitted to the pediatric ward for close observation. The next day, his vomiting persisted, especially after oral intake. Computed tomography with oral and intravenous contrast was performed, which showed a thickened bowel wall with a linear hypodensity in the submucosa, consistent with an intramural small bowel hematoma.

Intramural small bowel hematoma is a rare but serious complication of abdominal trauma. It is caused by a tear in the small bowel wall, which allows blood to leak into the submucosa. The most common symptom is abdominal pain, which is often severe and persistent. Other symptoms may include vomiting, diarrhea, and fever. The diagnosis is made with imaging studies, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Treatment is usually conservative, with supportive care and bowel rest. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to repair the tear.

The other possible diagnoses are all less likely in this case. Abdominal wall hematoma is a collection of blood in the abdominal wall. It is usually caused by a blunt trauma to the abdomen, such as a fall or a car accident. The patient would typically have a history of trauma, and the physical examination would reveal tenderness and ecchymosis over the site of the hematoma. Small-bowel perforation is a hole in the wall of the small intestine. It is usually caused by a foreign object, such as a piece of food or a sharp object. The patient would typically have abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. Traumatic pancreatic injury is a tear in the pancreas. It is usually caused by a blunt trauma to the abdomen, such as a fall or a car accident. The patient would typically have abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.

 51%|█████     | 779/1525 [2:57:46<2:16:28, 10.98s/it]Answer: A. Acute appendicitis

Explanation:
The patient is a woman in her mid-20s who was 8 weeks pregnant presented to the emergency department for abdominal pain localized in the right iliac fossa (RIF), numbness in the right lower limb, and nausea and vomiting. On examination she had tenderness in the RIF with a positive Blumberg sign; blood testing showed leukocyte count 10 450/μL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001) without any shift, C-reactive protein 1.29 mg/dL (to convert to nanomoles per liter, multiply by 0.331), and hemoglobin 11.4 g/dL (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10). The Alvarado score was 7. A transabdominal ultrasonographic scan showed a tubular structure in the RIF consistent with a mildly inflamed appendix and stratification of the appendiceal wall (7 mm in the proximal and 11 mm in the appendiceal distal tract). A small amount of free fluid was present in the Douglas pouch. A transvaginal ultrasonographic scan confirmed normal intrauterine gestation with a vital embryo. Working diagnosis was uncomplicated appendicitis and initial conservative management was amoxicillin clavulanate because of the potential risks of miscarriage associated with performing an avoidable appendectomy and general anesthesia during early gestation. The patient initially improved and was discharged home 2 days later with an Alvarado score of 4; oral antibiotic therapy was continued. Three days later she returned to the emergency department with recurrent pain; the clinical and ultrasonographic findings were unchanged, without evidence of complicated appendicitis, intra-abdominal fluid collection, or abscess. The Alvarado score was 5. The patient was admitted to the surgical ward and given intravenous antibiotics. In the next 48 hours the symptoms and pain did not resolve, although inflammatory markers were low and the patient was not septic. The surgeon on call requested an urgent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) investigation (Figure 1).Magnetic resonance imaging showed the gestational chamber and a normal intrauterine pregnancy as well as the presence of a tubular structure in the right iliac fossa (RIF) (A) and what appeared to be an inflamed, thickened appendix (9.83 mm in the proximal appendix) (B).

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is acute appendicitis. The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with appendicitis, and the laboratory findings are supportive of this diagnosis. The transabdominal ultrasonographic scan showed a tubular structure in the RIF consistent with a mildly inflamed appendix. The transvaginal ultrasonographic scan confirmed normal intrauterine gestation with a vital embryo. The MRI investigation showed the gestational chamber and a normal intrauterine pregnancy as well as the presence of a tubular structure in the right iliac fossa (RIF) and what appeared to be an inflamed, thickened appendix.

Salpingitis or sactosalpinx (eg, pyosalpinx or hydrosalpinx) is a possible diagnosis, but it is less likely than acute appendicitis. The patient does not have any symptoms or signs of salpingitis, and the laboratory findings are not supportive of this diagnosis. The transabdominal ultrasonographic scan did not show any evidence of salpingitis. The MRI investigation did not show any evidence of salpingitis.

Heterotopic pregnancy is a possible diagnosis, but it is less likely than acute appendicitis. The patient does not have any symptoms or signs of heterotopic pregnancy, and the laboratory findings are not supportive of this diagnosis. The transabdominal ultrasonographic scan did not show any evidence of heterotopic pregnancy. The MRI investigation did not show any evidence of heterotopic pregnancy.

Nonspecific abdominal pain or pelvic inflammatory disease is a possible diagnosis, but it is less likely than acute appendicitis. The patient does not have any symptoms or signs of nonspecific abdominal pain or pelvic inflammatory disease, and the laboratory findings are not supportive of this diagnosis. The transabdominal ultrasonographic scan did not show any evidence of nonspecific abdominal pain or pelvic inflammatory disease. The MRI investigation did not show any evidence of nonspecific abdominal pain or pelvic inflammatory disease.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is acute appendicitis.

 51%|█████     | 780/1525 [2:58:02<2:37:01, 12.65s/it]The correct answer is: **D. Observe.**

The patient's symptoms and history are consistent with West Nile virus (WNV) encephalitis. WNV is a viral infection that can cause a variety of neurological symptoms, including floaters. In most cases, WNV infection is mild and self-limiting. However, in some cases, it can cause more serious complications, such as meningitis, encephalitis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome.

In this case, the patient has a history of WNV encephalitis and is currently experiencing new-onset floaters. However, she does not have any other symptoms, such as blurry vision, eye pain, or photopsia. Additionally, her visual acuity is 20/20 OU and her intraocular pressure is 14 mm Hg OU. These findings suggest that the patient's floaters are likely due to WNV encephalitis and are not caused by a more serious condition, such as retinal detachment or vitreous hemorrhage.

Given the patient's history and current symptoms, it is reasonable to observe her for a period of time to see if her floaters resolve on their own. If the floaters do not resolve, or if the patient develops any new symptoms, then further testing, such as a vitreous biopsy or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, may be warranted.

Here is a table summarizing the rationale for each answer choice:

| Answer Choice | Rationale |
| --- | --- |
| A. Order vitreous biopsy | A vitreous biopsy is a surgical procedure in which a small sample of vitreous humor is removed from the eye. This procedure is typically performed to diagnose or treat a variety of eye conditions, such as retinal detachment, vitreous hemorrhage, and uveitis. In this case, there is no evidence that the patient has any of these conditions, so a vitreous biopsy is not warranted. |
| B. Order magnetic resonance imaging of the brain | A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is a non-invasive imaging test that uses a magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of the inside of the body. MRI scans are often used to diagnose a variety of medical conditions, including brain tumors, stroke, and multiple sclerosis. In this case, the patient has a history of WNV encephalitis, which can cause inflammation of the brain. However, she does not have any other symptoms, such as headache, fever, or seizures, that would suggest that she has a recurrence of her encephalitis. Therefore, an MRI scan is not necessary at this time. |
| C. Order biopsy of chorioretinal lesion | A chorioretinal lesion is a condition that affects the choroid and retina, two of the layers of tissue that line the back of the eye. Chorioretinal lesions can be caused by a variety of factors, including infection, inflammation, and tumors. In this case, the patient has a history of WNV encephalitis, which can cause inflammation of the choroid and retina. However, she does not have any other symptoms, such as blurry vision, eye pain, or photopsia, that would suggest that she has a chorioretinal lesion. Therefore, a biopsy of the chorioretinal lesion is not necessary at this time. |
| D. Observe | Observation is the process of monitoring a patient's condition without taking any active treatment. In this case, the patient has a history of WNV encephalitis and is currently experiencing new-onset floaters. However, she does not have any other symptoms, such as blurry vision, eye pain, or photopsia. Additionally, her visual acuity is 20/20 OU and her intraocular pressure is 14 mm Hg OU. These findings suggest that the patient's floaters are likely due to WNV encephalitis and are not caused by a more serious condition, such as retinal detachment or vitreous hemorrhage. Given the patient's history and current symptoms, it is reasonable to observe her for a period of time to see if her floaters resolve on their own. If the floaters do not resolve, or if the patient develops any new symptoms, then further testing, such as a vitreous biopsy or magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, may be warranted.

The patient is a 16-year-old girl with a history of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma and stem cell transplant who presents with blurry vision in the left eye. One day prior, she developed a new-onset right facial palsy in addition to bilateral eyelid, lip, and feet swelling. Ophthalmologic evaluation revealed visual acuities of 20/20 OD and 20/800 OS. The left eye showed a relative afferent pupillary defect and decreased color vision. Extraocular movements, confrontation visual fields, and intraocular pressures were within normal limits. Anterior segment examination was unremarkable in both eyes. Dilated fundus examination revealed optic nerve head edema and peripapillary hemorrhages bilaterally, greater in the left eye than in the right eye. Scattered peripheral hemorrhages were present, consistent with thrombocytopenia at the time.

The most likely diagnosis is optic nerve compression by lymphoma. The patient's history of T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma and stem cell transplant makes her at risk for this complication. The clinical findings of optic nerve head edema, peripapillary hemorrhages, and relative afferent pupillary defect are all consistent with optic nerve compression.

The next step in management is to obtain a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbits and brain. This will help to confirm the diagnosis of optic nerve compression and identify the extent of the disease. If the MRI shows evidence of optic nerve compression, the patient will need to be treated with corticosteroids and/or radiation therapy.

The other options are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate next steps in management. Option A, observe, is not appropriate because the patient is at risk for permanent vision loss if the optic nerve compression is not treated. Option B, perform a lumbar puncture, is not necessary to make the diagnosis of optic nerve compression. Option D, perform optic nerve decompression, is not necessary if the patient is treated with corticosteroids and/or radiation therapy.

The patient has a small, yellowish orange discontinuity found in the inferior peripapillary region of the optic conus in the right eye. This is a peripapillary intrachoroidal cavitation, which is a rare condition that can be caused by a number of things, including trauma, inflammation, and tumors. It is not usually associated with any symptoms, but it can sometimes lead to visual field defects or serous macular detachment.

In this case, the patient has no symptoms and her visual fields are full. Therefore, the most appropriate course of action is to order visual field testing and observe closely for serous macular detachment. If the patient develops any symptoms or her visual fields worsen, then further treatment, such as laser therapy, may be necessary.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits is not necessary because the patient has no symptoms and her visual fields are full. Immediately demarcating the region with indirect argon laser barricade is not necessary because the patient has no symptoms and her visual fields are full.

Explanation:
The patient in the case presented has a creamy elevated lesion after transscleral cyclophotocoagulation. This is a concerning finding, as it could be a sign of infection. The patient also has a history of diabetes and bilateral ocular trauma, which puts him at increased risk for infection.

The most appropriate next step in management is to perform exploratory surgery in the operating room and start intravenous antibiotics. This will allow the surgeon to directly visualize the lesion and obtain cultures to identify the infecting organism. The surgeon can also debride any infected tissue and start intravenous antibiotics to treat the infection.

Obtaining cultures at the slitlamp is not an adequate way to diagnose or treat an infection in this case. The lesion is too deep to be visualized with the slitlamp, and cultures obtained from the surface of the eye may not be representative of the organism that is causing the infection.

Performing a vitreous tap and injecting antibiotics is not an appropriate next step in management. This procedure is invasive and carries a risk of complications, such as infection and retinal detachment. It is also not clear that this procedure would be effective in treating the infection in this case.

Starting a high dose of systemic steroids is not an appropriate next step in management. Steroids can suppress the immune system, which could make the infection worse. They can also increase the risk of complications, such as cataracts and glaucoma.

In conclusion, the most appropriate next step in management is to perform exploratory surgery in the operating room and start intravenous antibiotics. This will allow the surgeon to directly visualize the lesion and obtain cultures to identify the infecting organism. The surgeon can also debride any infected tissue and start intravenous antibiotics to treat the infection.

Explanation: The patient has a history of recurrent oral cancer, including a palatal graft and a left buccal mucosa lesion. She has also had three recurrences of SCC in rapid succession. Each malignant neoplasm was locally resected and the patient was also treated with adjuvant radiotherapy for the last episode. She remained asymptomatic, and a routine surveillance clinical examination uncovered a sixth lesion at the margin of a palatal graft.

The PET scan results showed focal fludeoxyglucose F 18 localization within the known oral cavity SCC and in a small, level IIA lymph node, located lateral to the upper right internal jugular vein. There was unexpected, prominent, metabolic activity in the medial and asymmetrically enlarged left vocal cord.

The combination of the patient's history, the PET scan findings, and the presence of a left vocal cord lesion with increased metabolic activity is highly suggestive of primary laryngeal carcinoma in the setting of extensive, recurrent head and neck SCC.

The other options are incorrect because:

* Metastatic squamous cell carcinoma is less likely than primary laryngeal carcinoma in this patient, given her history of recurrent oral cancer.
* Inflammatory reaction is unlikely to cause the degree of metabolic activity seen on the PET scan.
* Postradiation change is unlikely to cause the asymmetric enlargement of the left vocal cord seen on the PET scan.

The patient's presentation is consistent with cardiomyopathy, a disease of the heart muscle. Cardiomyopathy can be caused by a variety of factors, including genetic mutations, viral infections, and autoimmune disorders. Genetic testing can help to identify the specific genetic mutation that is causing the patient's cardiomyopathy. This information can be used to guide treatment and to provide information about the patient's prognosis.

Treadmill stress test and cardiac catheterization are both tests that can be used to assess the function of the heart. However, these tests would not be able to identify the specific genetic mutation that is causing the patient's cardiomyopathy. Electrophysiological study is a test that is used to assess the electrical activity of the heart. This test would not be able to identify the specific genetic mutation that is causing the patient's cardiomyopathy.

Therefore, genetic testing is the best next step in the management of this patient.

A glomus tumor is a rare, benign neoplasm of the glomus body, a small, specialized vascular structure found in the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and other organs. Glomus tumors are typically painful and often occur in the hands, feet, and head and neck.

A solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) is a rare, benign tumor that can occur in any part of the body, but is most common in the abdomen. SFTs are typically slow-growing and asymptomatic, but can cause symptoms if they grow large enough to press on nearby structures.

A myopericytoma is a rare, benign tumor that arises from the pericytes, cells that surround blood vessels. Myopericytomas can occur in any part of the body, but are most common in the extremities. They are typically slow-growing and asymptomatic, but can cause symptoms if they grow large enough to press on nearby structures.

In the case of the asymptomatic septal mass, the histopathological analysis demonstrated a well-circumscribed submucosal lesion comprised of bland, round, syncytial cells, arranged in a concentric fashion around variably sized slit-like vascular spaces, a minority of which were staghorn in appearance. This finding is consistent with a myofibroma, which is a benign tumor of mesenchymal origin that is composed of bland, spindle-shaped cells arranged in a storiform or fascicular pattern. Myofibromas are typically immunopositive for smooth muscle actin and muscle specific actin, as was the case in the patient in this case.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not fit the histopathological findings in this case. Glomus tumors are typically composed of small, round cells with abundant cytoplasm and a characteristic "glomus body" appearance. SFTs are typically composed of spindle-shaped cells with a storiform or fascicular pattern. Myopericytomas are typically composed of spindle-shaped cells with a perivascular arrangement.

Explanation:

The patient in the case presented with a 6-month history of dysphagia, a 3-month history of a 2.268-kg weight loss (to convert to pounds, divide by 0.454), and a right neck mass. Tobacco history was minimal and distant, and alcohol use was social only. Physical examination, including flexible nasolaryngoscopy, was notable for a large smooth nonulcerated right base of tongue mass with almost complete pharyngeal airway obstruction, and a 4-cm right level II lymph node. Computed tomography (CT) imaging revealed a 3-cm base of tongue–lingual tonsil mass with multiple right Ib, IIa, and II/III nodes, the largest of which was 2.0 cm by 3.0 cm. Awake tracheotomy and direct laryngoscopy with biopsy of right base of tongue mass lesion was performed.

Histological analysis showed sheets and clusters of small round-oval uniform cells with minimal cytoplasm, granular chromatin pattern, and prominent nuclear molding (Figure, A) with positive immunoreactivity for cytokeratin (CK) 7 (Figure, B) and synaptophysin (Figure, C); a high mitotic rate was also exhibited (Figure, D). The cells were negative for CK 5 and 6, CK 20, NUT, p63, and chromogranin. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detected human papillomavirus (HPV) 16 DNA and did not detect HPV 6, 11, and 18 DNA.

The histopathological findings are most consistent with Merkel cell carcinoma. Merkel cell carcinoma is a rare, aggressive neuroendocrine carcinoma that typically arises in the skin of elderly adults. It is often associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, particularly HPV 16. The tumor cells are small, round, and uniform, with scant cytoplasm and prominent nuclear molding. They are positive for cytokeratin 7 and synaptophysin, and negative for CK 5 and 6, CK 20, NUT, p63, and chromogranin. Treatment for Merkel cell carcinoma typically involves surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. The prognosis for Merkel cell carcinoma is poor, with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 20%.

The other possible diagnoses are not as likely in this case. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of head and neck cancer, but it is not typically associated with HPV infection. Small-cell carcinoma is a type of lung cancer, but it can also occur in other sites, including the head and neck. Primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET) is a rare, aggressive tumor that typically arises in the central nervous system. It is not typically associated with HPV infection.

Explanation:

Intradiploic meningoencephalocele is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by herniation of meninges and brain tissue through a defect in the skull. It is most commonly seen in the occipital region, as in this case.

The patient's history of clear drainage from his left naris during activity is consistent with cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea, which is a common symptom of intracranial meningoceles. The CT scan showed a lytic lesion of the left occipital bone, which is also consistent with a meningocele. The MRI showed a lesion, isointense to CSF, with thinning of the bony cortex, which is further evidence of a meningocele.

Multiple myeloma, Paget disease, and fibrous dysplasia are all possible causes of lytic lesions of the skull, but they are not associated with cerebrospinal fluid rhinorrhea. Therefore, the diagnosis of intradiploic meningoencephalocele is the most likely explanation for the patient's symptoms and imaging findings.

The patient's history of congenital nystagmus, platinum white hair, and a history of cutaneous melanoma are all consistent with the diagnosis of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome. This is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding diathesis, and increased risk of gastrointestinal and pulmonary fibrosis. Patients with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome are at increased risk of infection due to their impaired immune system. Therefore, it is important to inquire about a history of frequent infections in order to make the diagnosis and provide appropriate treatment.

The other options are not as relevant to the patient's presentation. A dilated ophthalmic examination may be helpful to rule out other causes of nystagmus, but it is not necessary in the setting of a known diagnosis of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome. Molecular genetic testing is not necessary for the diagnosis of Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, but it may be helpful to confirm the diagnosis and to screen for other family members who may be affected. Counseling to avoid sun exposure is important for all patients with Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome, but it is not the most important next step in this patient's management.

Explanation: The patient has a rapidly enlarging tender nodule on her right fifth digit with central ulceration. This is concerning for a neoplasm, such as a basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma. The most appropriate next step is to biopsy the lesion to obtain a definitive diagnosis. Incision and drainage is not appropriate without a diagnosis, as it could potentially spread the lesion. Prescribing an anti-inflammatory agent would not address the underlying cause of the lesion. A touch preparation is not a reliable method for diagnosing skin lesions.

Explanation:

Granuloma annulare is a common, benign skin condition that is characterized by the formation of annular, or ring-shaped, lesions. The lesions are usually small, raised, and pink or red, and they may be scaly or crusted. Granuloma annulare can occur anywhere on the body, but it is most common on the hands, feet, and arms. The exact cause of granuloma annulare is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder. Treatment is usually not necessary, as the lesions often go away on their own. However, if the lesions are large or unsightly, they may be treated with topical or oral steroids.

In the case of the toddler in the question, the patient has a history of neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), which is a genetic disorder that can cause the development of tumors throughout the body, including the skin. NF1 is also associated with an increased risk of developing certain other skin conditions, including granuloma annulare. The patient's rash is consistent with the typical presentation of granuloma annulare, with multiple annular, indurated, dusky red plaques with central clearing and trailing scale. The histopathologic examination of a biopsy of the lesion showed a perivascular and periadnexal infiltrate, which is also consistent with granuloma annulare.

The other possible diagnoses are not as likely in this case. Erythema annulare centrifugum is a skin condition that is characterized by the formation of annular lesions that have a central clearing. However, erythema annulare centrifugum is not associated with NF1, and it is not typically associated with a history of fever. Interstitial granulomatous dermatitis is a rare skin condition that is characterized by the formation of granulomas, which are small, inflammatory nodules, in the skin. However, interstitial granulomatous dermatitis is not typically associated with NF1, and it is not typically associated with a history of fever. Leukemia cutis is a skin condition that is characterized by the infiltration of leukemic cells into the skin. However, leukemia cutis is not typically associated with NF1, and it is not typically associated with a history of fever.

Explanation:
The patient in the case presented with a slowly progressive, asymptomatic cutaneous eruption on her hands and forearms, as well as an enlarging, painful ulcer on her left leg that developed 6 months earlier. Her medical history was notable for essential thrombocytosis, which had been complicated by portal vein thrombosis, and she had been receiving treatment with hydroxyurea and rivaroxaban for the past 2 years. Despite worsening cutaneous disease, she otherwise felt well and denied associated fevers, weakness, weight loss, myalgias, arthralgias, or other constitutional symptoms.

Physical examination revealed atrophic and reticulated violaceous plaques with a striking photoaccentuated distribution on the patient’s dorsal hands and forearms. Scaly, violaceous plaques were also present on the thenar eminences and radial aspects of her first 2 fingers bilaterally. Prominent poikiloderma was seen on her sun-exposed chest and neck, and a large, stellate ulcer was present on her left distal lower leg. A lesional skin biopsy was performed on the patient’s left forearm.

The histopathology of the skin biopsy showed perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with scattered histiocytes and occasional multinucleated giant cells. There was also mild perivascular fibrosis and vacuolar degeneration of the basal keratinocytes. These findings were consistent with a diagnosis of hydroxyurea-induced dermatomyositis-like eruption.

Hydroxyurea is a chemotherapeutic agent that is used to treat a variety of hematologic malignancies, including essential thrombocytosis. It is thought to work by inhibiting DNA synthesis. Hydroxyurea can also cause a variety of cutaneous side effects, including a dermatomyositis-like eruption. This eruption is characterized by violaceous, scaly plaques that are often photodistributed. It can also be associated with poikiloderma, which is a characteristic skin change that is characterized by atrophy, telangiectasia, and hyperpigmentation.

The diagnosis of hydroxyurea-induced dermatomyositis-like eruption is made clinically and supported by histopathology. The treatment of hydroxyurea-induced dermatomyositis-like eruption is discontinuation of hydroxyurea. In some cases, topical corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents may be necessary.

The other possible diagnoses in this case are all incorrect. Cutaneous lupus erythematosus is a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect the skin, joints, and other organs. It is characterized by a variety of skin lesions, including erythematous plaques, discoid lesions, and photosensitivity. Cutaneous microvascular occlusion secondary to essential thrombocytosis is a rare complication of essential thrombocytosis that can cause cutaneous ischemia and necrosis. It is characterized by painful, purplish lesions on the extremities. Hydroxyurea-induced dermatomyositis-like eruption is a rare side effect of hydroxyurea that can mimic the cutaneous findings of dermatomyositis. Polyarteritis nodosa is a systemic vasculitis that can affect the skin, kidneys, heart, and other organs. It is characterized by painful, tender nodules on the extremities.

Sneddon syndrome is a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by livedo reticularis, recurrent strokes, and antiphospholipid antibodies. The patient in this case presents with generalized net-like erythema (livedo reticularis), a history of 5 strokes, and antiphospholipid antibodies. The other options are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's presentation.

Cutis marmorata telangiectatica congenita (van Lohuizen syndrome) is a congenital disorder characterized by livedo reticularis that is present at birth. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disorder that can cause a variety of symptoms, including livedo reticularis, but it does not typically cause strokes.

 52%|█████▏    | 794/1525 [3:01:18<2:43:05, 13.39s/it]The correct answer is: A. Multiple sclerosis (MS).

Explanation:

MS is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system (CNS), which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. In MS, the body's immune system attacks the myelin sheath, which is a protective layer that surrounds nerve fibers. This damage can cause a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, numbness, weakness, vision problems, and problems with balance and coordination.

The symptoms of MS can vary widely from person to person, and they can come and go over time. Some people with MS have only mild symptoms, while others have more severe symptoms that can significantly impact their quality of life. There is no cure for MS, but there are treatments that can help to manage the symptoms and slow the progression of the disease.

The patient in this case presents with a history of recurrent episodes of dysarthria and ataxia. She also has a history of a demyelinating lesion on brain MRI, which is a characteristic finding in MS. The results of her CSF studies are also consistent with MS, as they show a mild lymphocytic pleocytosis and the absence of oligoclonal bands.

The other possible diagnoses in this case are all less likely. Central nervous system lymphoma is a rare cancer that affects the brain and spinal cord. It is more common in older adults, and it is typically associated with other symptoms, such as headache, seizures, and weakness. Autoimmune encephalitis is an autoimmune disorder that affects the brain. It is more common in women, and it is typically associated with other symptoms, such as fever, seizures, and changes in mental status. Neurosarcoidosis is a rare inflammatory disease that can affect any part of the body, including the CNS. It is more common in people of African descent, and it is typically associated with other symptoms, such as fever, weight loss, and fatigue.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for the patient in this case is MS. The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are all consistent with this diagnosis.

Explanation:

Angiokeratoma is a benign vascular skin lesion that is characterized by small, red or purple papules. It is most commonly seen on the lower extremities, but can also occur on the hands, feet, and mucous membranes. Angiokeratomas are often associated with hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), a genetic disorder that causes abnormal blood vessels throughout the body.

In the case of the 16-year-old boy, the lesion on his right lower back began as a stable red lesion when he was 7 years old. However, over the preceding month, it developed new black spots within it. This suggests that the lesion is changing rapidly, which is a characteristic of angiokeratoma. Additionally, the patient's family history is notable for dysplastic nevus syndrome in his father and melanoma in a paternal uncle and cousin. This increases the patient's risk of developing other types of skin cancer, including melanoma.

Melanoma is a type of skin cancer that can be fatal if not detected and treated early. It is characterized by a dark mole that changes in size, shape, or color. The patient's lesion does not meet the criteria for melanoma, as it is not a dark mole and has not changed in size, shape, or color.

Congenital nevus is a type of birthmark that is present at birth. It is typically a flat or raised lesion that can be any color, including black, brown, red, or blue. The patient's lesion is not a congenital nevus, as it did not appear until he was 7 years old.

Mastocytoma is a type of skin cancer that is caused by a growth of mast cells, which are cells that release chemicals that cause inflammation. It is characterized by a raised, red or purple lesion that can be itchy and painful. The patient's lesion does not meet the criteria for mastocytoma, as it is not raised, red or purple, and is not itchy or painful.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for the 16-year-old boy is angiokeratoma.

Explanation: The patient is a 40-year-old man with a 3-month history of a right breast mass slowly enlarging with associated pain. The mass is hard, irregular, mobile, and tethered to the overlying skin but not fixed to the underlying muscle. There are palpable ipsilateral lymph nodes. The left breast and axilla are normal. Right mediolateral oblique mammography shows a breast mass and axillary lymph nodes. Computed tomography of the chest shows the right breast mass involving the skin but not the pectoralis muscle. These findings are most consistent with carcinoma. Gynecomastia is a benign condition that causes enlargement of the male breast. It is usually caused by an imbalance of the hormones estrogen and testosterone. Lipoma is a benign tumor of fat cells. Epidermal inclusion cyst is a benign cyst that forms when skin cells become trapped in the skin. All of these conditions are less likely than carcinoma to cause a hard, irregular, mobile mass that is tethered to the overlying skin and not fixed to the underlying muscle. Additionally, carcinoma is more likely to be associated with palpable ipsilateral lymph nodes.

Explanation:

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with small-bowel ischemia. The laboratory values show evidence of an inflammatory response and metabolic acidosis. The computed tomography scan shows diffuse free fluid, dilated small bowel with thickened, hypoenhancing bowel walls, and markedly edematous mesentery. These findings are consistent with superior mesenteric artery thromboembolism.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract. It is characterized by recurrent episodes of diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss. The patient's history and physical examination do not suggest IBD. The laboratory values are not specific for IBD. The computed tomography scan does not show any evidence of bowel wall thickening or inflammation.

Small-bowel neoplasm is a rare tumor that can occur in any part of the small bowel. It is typically diagnosed in patients older than 50 years of age. The patient's history and physical examination do not suggest a small-bowel neoplasm. The laboratory values are not specific for a small-bowel neoplasm. The computed tomography scan does not show any evidence of a mass or tumor.

Mesenteric venous thrombosis is a rare condition that occurs when a blood clot forms in a vein in the mesentery. It is typically seen in patients with underlying conditions such as portal hypertension, malignancy, or inflammatory bowel disease. The patient's history and physical examination do not suggest mesenteric venous thrombosis. The laboratory values are not specific for mesenteric venous thrombosis. The computed tomography scan does not show any evidence of a thrombus in the mesentery.

Superior mesenteric artery thromboembolism is a rare condition that occurs when a blood clot forms in the superior mesenteric artery. It is typically seen in patients with underlying conditions such as atrial fibrillation, cardiac arrhythmia, or hypercoagulable states. The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with superior mesenteric artery thromboembolism. The laboratory values show evidence of an inflammatory response and metabolic acidosis. The computed tomography scan shows diffuse free fluid, dilated small bowel with thickened, hypoenhancing bowel walls, and markedly edematous mesentery.

Explanation:

The patient is a 7-day-old healthy infant with acute dacryocystitis and overlying preseptal cellulitis. The patient was initially treated with intravenous antibiotics and on day 2 of admission, ophthalmology was consulted. A bedside beveled percutaneous needle drainage was performed with a 25-gauge syringe. The lacrimal sac was decompressed and 3 mL of purulent discharge was aspirated. By day 3 of admission, the edema and preseptal cellulitis had improved.

At this point, the next step in management is to probe with silicone intubation of the lacrimal drainage system. This procedure is a minimally invasive way to open the nasolacrimal duct and allow drainage of the lacrimal sac. It is the preferred treatment for acute dacryocystitis in infants and children.

The other options are not appropriate at this time. Transition to oral antibiotics and discharge is premature, as the patient has not yet been fully treated for the infection. Perform lacrimal sac digital massage is not likely to be effective in this case, as the nasolacrimal duct is already blocked. Conduct endoscopic nasal exploration and marsupialization is a more invasive procedure that is reserved for patients who have failed other treatments.

The patient's history and physical examination findings are consistent with multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system (CNS). It is characterized by the destruction of myelin, the protective sheath that surrounds nerve fibers. This damage can lead to a variety of symptoms, including optic neuritis, which is inflammation of the optic nerve, and optic disc edema. MS can also cause retinal hemorrhages, which are bleeding in the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye.

Lumbar puncture is a procedure in which a needle is inserted into the spinal canal to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF is a clear fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. It is a valuable diagnostic tool for MS because it can be used to detect the presence of inflammatory cells and antibodies that are associated with the disease.

Corticosteroids are a type of medication that can be used to reduce inflammation. They can be helpful in treating the symptoms of MS, such as optic neuritis and optic disc edema. However, they do not slow the progression of the disease.

Rheumatology is a medical specialty that deals with diseases of the joints, bones, and muscles. A rheumatologist may be consulted to rule out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus.

Azithromycin is an antibiotic that is used to treat bacterial infections. It is not effective against MS.

Measuring the patient's blood pressure is important, but it is not the most important next step in the management of this patient. The patient's blood pressure should be monitored to ensure that it is well-controlled, but this does not need to be done immediately. The most important next step is to order a lumbar puncture to confirm the diagnosis of MS.

The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with post-inflammatory optic neuropathy (PION). PION is a rare but well-recognized complication of acute demyelinating syndromes, such as optic neuritis. It is characterized by optic nerve inflammation and swelling, which can lead to visual loss. The inflammation typically resolves within a few months, but some patients may experience permanent visual impairment.

In this case, the patient's visual loss is likely due to PION that developed in the setting of her Bell palsy. The Bell palsy is a self-limiting condition that typically resolves within a few weeks. The patient's oral prednisone is likely being used to treat the inflammation associated with her Bell palsy.

The most appropriate management for PION is to taper the oral prednisone and reassure the patient that the symptoms will gradually resolve. In most cases, the visual loss will improve over time. However, some patients may experience permanent visual impairment.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option B: Administer intravitreal injection of an anti–vascular endothelial growth factor agent is not indicated for PION. Anti-VEGF agents are used to treat retinal diseases characterized by abnormal blood vessel growth, such as wet age-related macular degeneration.
* Option C: Order brain neuroimaging and lumbar puncture is not necessary in this case. The patient's history and examination findings are not concerning for a central nervous system (CNS) infection or malignancy.
* Option D: Order an infectious and inflammatory workup is not necessary in this case. The patient's history and examination findings are not concerning for an infectious or inflammatory condition.

A Tzanck smear is a simple test that can be used to diagnose Stevens-Johnson syndrome. It involves scraping a sample of the lesion and then staining it with a special dye. If the sample contains cells that are characteristic of Stevens-Johnson syndrome, the test will be positive.

The other options are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate treatments for Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Corticosteroid eyedrops may be used to treat the eye inflammation associated with Stevens-Johnson syndrome, but they are not a definitive treatment for the condition. Echocardiography and intravenous immunoglobulin are treatments that are used for other conditions, such as Kawasaki disease and myocarditis, respectively. They are not appropriate treatments for Stevens-Johnson syndrome.

Institute contact precautions and prescribe mupirocin ointment to eyelid skin are important steps in preventing the spread of Stevens-Johnson syndrome to others. However, they are not definitive treatments for the condition.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with a spontaneous perinephric hematoma. The most common cause of spontaneous perinephric hematoma is a ruptured renal artery aneurysm. Other causes include trauma, coagulopathy, and tumor. The patient's history of mantle cell lymphoma is significant because ibrutinib, the medication she is taking, is associated with an increased risk of bleeding. The patient's CT scan shows a large hematoma in the left perinephric space, which is consistent with a ruptured renal artery aneurysm. The patient's other findings, including hypotension, conjunctival pallor, left renal angle tenderness, low hemoglobin, thrombocytopenia, and leukocytosis, are also consistent with a spontaneous perinephric hematoma.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm rupture is a less likely diagnosis because the patient does not have any risk factors for aortic aneurysm, such as smoking, hypertension, or atherosclerosis. The patient's CT scan does not show any evidence of an aortic aneurysm.

Splenic rupture is a less likely diagnosis because the patient does not have any risk factors for splenic rupture, such as trauma, coagulopathy, or tumor. The patient's CT scan does not show any evidence of splenic rupture.

Solitary fibrous tumors are rare, benign mesenchymal neoplasms that can occur in any part of the body, but are most common in the pleura (the membrane that lines the lungs), the peritoneum (the membrane that lines the abdominal cavity), and the soft tissues. They are typically slow-growing tumors that can cause symptoms depending on their location. In the sinonasal cavity, solitary fibrous tumors can cause nasal obstruction, epistaxis (nosebleed), and facial pain.

Pathologically, solitary fibrous tumors are characterized by a proliferation of spindle cells arranged in a storiform pattern. The tumor cells typically have bland nuclei and little atypia. Immunohistochemically, solitary fibrous tumors are typically positive for CD34 and vimentin, and negative for epithelial markers such as keratin.

The treatment of solitary fibrous tumors is surgical resection. In the sinonasal cavity, this can be performed endoscopically or via open surgery. Recurrence after surgery is rare.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma is a rare, aggressive sarcoma that can occur in the sinonasal cavity. It is typically composed of a mixture of epithelial and mesenchymal cells. Biphenotypic sinonasal sarcomas are high-grade tumors that are often fatal.
* Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor is a rare, malignant tumor that arises from the peripheral nerves. It can occur anywhere in the body, but is most common in the extremities. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors are high-grade tumors that are often fatal.

Explanation:

Infections (including viral, bacterial, and fungal infections) are the most common cause of parotid masses in children. Infectious pseudotumor is a benign condition that is characterized by a rapid-growing, painful mass in the parotid gland. It is usually caused by a viral infection, such as mumps or Epstein-Barr virus.

The diagnosis of infectious pseudotumor is made based on clinical presentation, imaging studies, and histopathology. Imaging studies, such as CT scan or MRI, can show a mass in the parotid gland that is often necrotic. Histopathology shows a granulomatous inflammation with necrosis.

The treatment of infectious pseudotumor is usually surgical excision of the mass. However, in some cases, the mass may resolve spontaneously with treatment of the underlying infection.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a malignant salivary gland tumor that is rare in children. It is usually a slow-growing tumor that does not cause pain.
* Histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis is a rare inflammatory condition that can affect lymph nodes in any part of the body. It is usually seen in children and young adults.
* Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a systemic vasculitis that can affect any part of the body, including the parotid gland. It is usually seen in adults.

The physical examination findings of biphasic stridor and a weak cry are also consistent with subglottic stenosis. The patient's presentation with increased work of breathing, tachypnea, retractions, weak cry, and stridor suggests that the subglottic stenosis has progressed to a critical degree. The lack of response to racemic epinephrine, albuterol, and steroids suggests that the subglottic stenosis is not due to inflammation. The positive viral panel for rhinovirus is consistent with a viral etiology for the subglottic stenosis. The direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy findings of a narrowed subglottic lumen with smooth borders are also consistent with subglottic stenosis. The capnography findings of a prolonged expiratory phase with quick chest wall rise on inspiration and slow fall with expiration are consistent with a restrictive lung disease, such as subglottic stenosis.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely. Laryngotracheitis (croup) is a viral infection that typically presents with a barking cough and inspiratory stridor. Subglottic cysts are typically asymptomatic and are often found incidentally on imaging studies. Subglottic hemangiomas are rare tumors that typically present in infancy with stridor and respiratory distress.

Explanation: The patient has a history of prostate cancer, which is a common cancer that can spread to other parts of the body, including the skin. The nodules are located in the inguinal folds, which are areas where the skin folds over itself. This is a common site for metastatic prostate cancer to spread. The nodules are also erythematous, which means they are red, and painful. This is also a common finding in metastatic prostate cancer. The other options are incorrect because they do not explain all of the patient's symptoms. Deep fungal infections are not typically painful, and they do not usually occur in the inguinal folds. Cutaneous malakoplakia is a rare skin condition that is not associated with prostate cancer. Granular cell tumors are also rare, and they are not typically painful.

 53%|█████▎    | 808/1525 [3:04:27<2:37:59, 13.22s/it]Answer: C. Secondary syphilis.

Explanation:

The patient is a previously healthy man in his 30s with a 4-month history of asymptomatic cutaneous lesions. The lesions are annular, red, and scaly, with satellite lesions. They are located on the trunk and extremities, and there are papulosquamous lesions on the left sole. The palms are spared, and there is no regional lymph node enlargement or systemic involvement.

The most likely diagnosis is secondary syphilis. Secondary syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection that is caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. It is characterized by a widespread rash that can involve the skin, mucous membranes, and lymph nodes. The rash is often described as annular, red, and scaly, with satellite lesions. It is also common for patients with secondary syphilis to have papulosquamous lesions on the soles of their feet.

The diagnosis of secondary syphilis is confirmed by serologic testing. The Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) test and the rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test are both non-treponemal tests that can be used to screen for syphilis. If the VDRL or RPR test is positive, a treponemal test such as the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) test should be performed to confirm the diagnosis.

The treatment for secondary syphilis is penicillin. Benzathine penicillin G is the preferred treatment, and it is given as a single intramuscular injection. Patients with penicillin allergy may be treated with doxycycline or erythromycin.

With treatment, the prognosis for secondary syphilis is good. Most patients will experience a complete resolution of their symptoms within a few weeks of treatment. However, if left untreated, secondary syphilis can progress to tertiary syphilis, which is a more serious and potentially life-threatening condition.

The other possible diagnoses are all less likely than secondary syphilis. Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune disease that is characterized by red, scaly patches of skin. The lesions of psoriasis are often described as well-demarcated and "island-like." They are typically located on the elbows, knees, scalp, and lower back. Psoriasis is not a sexually transmitted infection, and it is not associated with a positive VDRL or RPR test.

Lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease that can affect the skin, joints, kidneys, and other organs. The skin lesions of lupus erythematosus are often described as malar rash, discoid rash, or photosensitivity. The malar rash is a butterfly-shaped rash that is located on the cheeks and bridge of the nose. The discoid rash is a scaly, red rash that is often found on the face, scalp, and ears. Photosensitivity is a reaction to sunlight that can cause the skin to become red, swollen, and itchy. Lupus erythematosus is not a sexually transmitted infection, and it is not associated with a positive VDRL or RPR test.

T-cell lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the T cells, a type of white blood cell. T-cell lymphoma can cause a variety of symptoms, including skin lesions, lymph node enlargement, and fever. The skin lesions of T-cell lymphoma are often described as papules, plaques, or tumors. They can be located anywhere on the body, but they are most commonly found on the head and neck. T-cell lymphoma is not a sexually transmitted infection, and it is not associated with a positive VDRL or RPR test.

 53%|█████▎    | 809/1525 [3:04:43<2:46:01, 13.91s/it]The correct answer is: **B. Subcutaneous sarcoidosis**

Subcutaneous sarcoidosis is a rare condition that occurs when abnormal collections of immune cells called granulomas form in the subcutaneous fat. These granulomas can cause pain, swelling, and tenderness. The condition is most common in people who live in areas with a lot of dust or pollution.

The patient in this case has several features that are consistent with subcutaneous sarcoidosis. He is a middle-aged man, which is the age group that is most commonly affected by the condition. He also has a history of exposure to mold, which can trigger the development of sarcoidosis. The patient's laboratory tests showed that he has an elevated level of calcium in his blood, which is a common finding in people with sarcoidosis.

The patient's chest CT scan showed hilar lymphadenopathy, which is the enlargement of lymph nodes in the chest. This finding is also consistent with sarcoidosis. The patient's biopsy showed nodular aggregations of epithelioid histiocytes with sparse peripheral lymphocytes, extending from the deep dermis into the subcutis. This finding is also characteristic of sarcoidosis.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for the patient in this case is subcutaneous sarcoidosis.

The other possible diagnoses are:

* Sporotrichosis: This is a fungal infection that can cause skin lesions, lymphadenopathy, and arthritis. The patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with sporotrichosis.
* Tumoral calcinosis: This is a rare condition that causes calcium deposits to form in the skin and subcutaneous tissue. The patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with tumoral calcinosis.
* Erythema nodosum: This is a skin condition that causes red, painful nodules to form on the lower legs. The patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with erythema nodosum.

Explanation:
The patient has a history of eczema and multiple food allergies, which has led to a restrictive diet that is low in vitamin A. Vitamin A is essential for the proper function of the cornea, which is the clear front part of the eye. Vitamin A deficiency can lead to a condition called xerophthalmia, which is characterized by dry eyes, night blindness, and corneal scarring. The patient's presentation is consistent with xerophthalmia, and the diagnosis is supported by the findings on examination, including the presence of Bitot spots (dry, keratinized patches on the conjunctiva) and corneal epitheliopathy. The other options are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's presentation. Glaucoma is a condition that is characterized by increased pressure in the eye, which can lead to optic nerve damage and vision loss. Sjögren syndrome is an autoimmune disorder that can affect the glands that produce tears and saliva, leading to dry eyes and mouth. Bilateral cataracts are clouding of the lens of the eye, which can lead to vision loss.

 53%|█████▎    | 811/1525 [3:05:10<2:42:13, 13.63s/it]The answer is: B. Acute appendicitis.

Acute appendicitis is a common medical condition that occurs when the appendix, a small, finger-shaped organ that projects from the colon, becomes inflamed. The most common symptom of acute appendicitis is abdominal pain, which is usually located in the right lower abdomen. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, fever, and loss of appetite.

The diagnosis of acute appendicitis is usually made based on the patient's history and physical examination. Imaging tests, such as a CT scan or ultrasound, may be helpful to confirm the diagnosis.

Treatment for acute appendicitis is usually surgical removal of the appendix (appendectomy). This procedure is usually performed laparoscopically, which means that small incisions are made in the abdomen and a camera and surgical instruments are inserted through the incisions to remove the appendix.

Acute appendicitis is a serious condition that can lead to complications if not treated promptly. These complications may include rupture of the appendix, infection, and peritonitis.

The following are the reasons why the other options are incorrect:

* Desmoid tumors are rare, slow-growing tumors that usually occur in the abdominal wall. They are not associated with abdominal pain or other symptoms of appendicitis.
* Lymphoma is a type of cancer that can affect the lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, and other organs. It is not associated with abdominal pain or other symptoms of appendicitis.
* Carcinoid tumors are rare, slow-growing tumors that usually occur in the gastrointestinal tract. They are not associated with abdominal pain or other symptoms of appendicitis.

Mesenteric ischemia is a condition in which the blood supply to the intestines is blocked, which can lead to tissue death. It is a medical emergency and requires prompt treatment.

The patient in this case has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus, a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect many parts of the body, including the blood vessels. Lupus can increase the risk of developing mesenteric ischemia.

The patient's symptoms, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, and distention, are consistent with mesenteric ischemia. The abdominal CT scan showed evidence of thickened small bowel and free fluid, which are also consistent with mesenteric ischemia.

The other possible diagnoses are not as likely in this case. Superior mesenteric venous thrombosis is a rare condition that is more common in older adults and in people with cancer. Lupus enteritis is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that is more common in young women. Superior mesenteric artery embolism is a blockage of the artery that supplies blood to the small intestine. It is more common in people with atrial fibrillation, a type of irregular heartbeat.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is mesenteric ischemia. This is a serious condition that requires prompt treatment.

The patient has profound vision loss with no light perception vision and nonreactive pupils. This is consistent with bilateral optic nerve injury, which is a known complication of severe hypotension and anemia. The patient's magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was normal, which suggests that the optic nerve injury is not due to a mass lesion or other intracranial pathology.

The prognosis for patients with bilateral optic nerve injury is poor. Most patients do not recover significant vision, and some may develop permanent blindness. Therefore, it is important to counsel the patient about the potential for permanent vision loss and to provide support and resources to help him cope with this condition.

The other options are incorrect because they are not appropriate or necessary in this case. Option A (test patient with optokinetic nystagmus drum) is not necessary because the patient has no light perception vision. Option B (repeat magnetic resonance imaging of the brain) is not necessary because the patient's initial magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was normal. Option D (test pupils with dilute pilocarpine) is not necessary because the patient's pupils are nonreactive.

Explanation:
The patient's symptoms are consistent with atypical trigeminal neuralgia, which is a chronic pain condition that affects the trigeminal nerve. The trigeminal nerve is responsible for sensation in the face, and atypical trigeminal neuralgia can cause severe facial pain, numbness, and tingling. The pain is often described as sharp, stabbing, or electric-like, and it can be triggered by certain activities, such as talking, chewing, or washing the face.

There is no cure for atypical trigeminal neuralgia, but there are treatments that can help to manage the pain. The most common treatment is medication, such as carbamazepine or gabapentin. These medications can help to reduce the frequency and severity of the pain. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to relieve the pain.

In this case, the patient's symptoms have been present for 3 weeks and have failed to improve with treatment. Additionally, the patient has numbness in the distribution of the ophthalmic and maxillary branches of the right trigeminal nerve, including complete corneal anesthesia. These findings are concerning for a possible underlying cause of the patient's pain, such as a tumor or a stroke. Therefore, the next step in management is to order a contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. This test will allow the physician to visualize the brain and rule out any underlying structural abnormalities.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Option A, ordering a computed tomography (CT) scan of the brain with angiography, is not necessary because the patient does not have any signs or symptoms of a stroke. Option B, prescribing analgesia to treat atypical trigeminal neuralgia and referring the patient to a neurologist, is premature because the patient has not yet had a thorough evaluation to rule out any underlying causes of the pain. Option D, continuing treatment for blepharitis, is not appropriate because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with blepharitis.

The patient is a 5-year-old girl with a history of unilateral congenital ptosis of the left eye. She has no history of developmental delay, trauma, or systemic illness. Her best-corrected visual acuity is 20/30 OD and 20/40 OS. There is notable asymmetry in the following eyelid measurements: palpebral fissure height (10 mm OD; 5-6 mm OS) and margin reflex distance 1 (3.5 mm OD; 0.5-1.5 mm OS). In addition, elevation of the left upper eyelid is observed with lateral jaw thrust but not with anterior-posterior jaw movements or with mouth opening and closing. The levator function is 14 mm OU, and the margin crease distances are 5 mm OD and 6 mm OS. The remainder of the anterior and posterior segment slitlamp examination is unremarkable.

The patient's history and examination are consistent with congenital ptosis of the left eye. The most common cause of congenital ptosis is a defect in the levator muscle, which is responsible for elevating the upper eyelid. Other causes of congenital ptosis include Horner syndrome, myasthenia gravis, and third nerve palsy.

The management of congenital ptosis depends on the severity of the ptosis, the patient's age, and the presence of any other ocular abnormalities. In mild cases, observation may be all that is necessary. In more severe cases, surgery may be indicated to improve the patient's cosmesis and visual function.

In the patient described above, the ptosis is mild and there is no evidence of other ocular abnormalities. Therefore, the best option at this time is to observe the ptosis carefully and discuss surgical repair with the patient and her parents when she is older.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Genetic testing is not indicated in a patient with isolated congenital ptosis. Urgent neuroimaging is not indicated in a patient with isolated congenital ptosis. Oral corticosteroids are not indicated in the management of congenital ptosis.

Excisional biopsy is the removal of the entire mass, including the lateral rectus muscle. This is the most definitive way to diagnose the mass and determine its type. If the mass is malignant, excisional biopsy will also provide the most effective treatment.

Chemotherapy is not the best treatment for this patient because the mass is not likely to be responsive to chemotherapy. Chemotherapy can also have serious side effects, which would not be justified in this case.

Incisional biopsy is a less invasive procedure than excisional biopsy. In incisional biopsy, a small piece of the mass is removed for biopsy. This procedure is less likely to cause complications than excisional biopsy, but it is also less likely to provide a definitive diagnosis.

Corticosteroid treatment is not the best treatment for this patient because the mass is not likely to be responsive to corticosteroids. Corticosteroids can also have serious side effects, which would not be justified in this case.

Excisional biopsy is the best treatment for this patient because it is the most definitive way to diagnose the mass and determine its type. If the mass is malignant, excisional biopsy will also provide the most effective treatment.

Explanation:

The patient was diagnosed with multiple myeloma (MM), which is a cancer of plasma cells. Plasma cells are a type of white blood cell that produce antibodies. In MM, plasma cells become cancerous and produce abnormal antibodies, called monoclonal proteins. Monoclonal proteins can be detected in the blood or urine.

The patient's initial SPEP-IF showed an M-IgA κ band, which is a monoclonal protein of the IgA type. Two months later, SPEP-IF demonstrated a new M-IgG κ band in the same electrophoretic position as the M-IgA κ, with the 2 distinguishable only by IF and measured at 0.1 g/dL. This suggests that the patient's myeloma cells had evolved to produce both IgA- and IgG-type monoclonal proteins.

The patient's serum free κ/λ ratio gradually decreased to 4.86 one year later. This suggests that the patient's myeloma was responding to treatment.

The other possible explanations for the patient's test results are incorrect.

* Immune dysregulation from multiagent therapy resulting in a new M-protein is unlikely because the patient's M-protein was already present before treatment began.
* New MGUS or B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder, such as monoclonal B lymphocytosis is unlikely because the patient's M-protein was of the IgA type, which is not typically seen in these conditions.
* Therapeutic monoclonal antibody at serum concentration detectable by SPEP-IF is unlikely because the patient was not receiving any monoclonal antibody therapy.

The patient has a history of syncope, which is a sudden loss of consciousness. The most common cause of syncope is vasovagal syncope, which is a transient decrease in blood pressure and heart rate that leads to cerebral hypoperfusion. Other possible causes of syncope include arrhythmias, structural heart disease, and neurological disorders.

The patient's history and physical examination are not specific for any particular cause of syncope. The electrocardiogram shows sinus bradycardia, first-degree atrioventricular block, left posterior fascicle block, and right bundle branch block. These findings are non-specific and could be seen in a variety of conditions, including sinus node dysfunction, atrioventricular block, and cardiomyopathy. The transthoracic echocardiogram shows an ejection fraction of 50% without regional variation. This finding is also non-specific and could be seen in a variety of conditions, including cardiomyopathy, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. The exercise stress single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) shows transient high-grade atrioventricular block but no ischemic ST-segment changes or defects on perfusion imaging. This finding is suggestive of a vasovagal mechanism for the patient's syncope. However, it is also possible that the patient has an arrhythmia that is only triggered by exercise.

The cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (cMRI) with gadolinium contrast-enhanced first-pass myocardial perfusion imaging at rest and contrast-enhanced late gadolinium enhancement imaging revealed low-normal left ventricular systolic function but no other abnormalities. This finding does not provide any additional information about the cause of the patient's syncope.

Given the patient's history, physical examination, and test results, the most appropriate next step is to order 30-day event monitoring. This will allow the patient to be monitored for arrhythmias that may be causing his syncope. If an arrhythmia is detected, the patient can be treated with antiarrhythmic medications or other interventions. If no arrhythmia is detected, the patient may have a vasovagal or orthostatic cause of syncope. In this case, the patient can be treated with lifestyle modifications, such as avoiding standing for long periods of time and drinking plenty of fluids.

Invasive electrophysiologic testing (EPS) is not necessary in this patient because the patient's history and physical examination are not suggestive of an arrhythmia. Coronary angiography is not necessary in this patient because the patient's electrocardiogram and cMRI are not suggestive of coronary artery disease. Cardiac fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) is not necessary in this patient because the patient's history and physical examination are not suggestive of a cardiac malignancy.

The patient has a new-onset rash, fever, and pulmonary infiltrates. The rash is consistent with a drug reaction, and the pulmonary infiltrates could be due to infection, drug toxicity, or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). The patient's fevers have persisted despite antibiotic therapy, and his skin biopsy showed subtle vacuolar change and rare epidermal dyskeratosis, which are findings that are consistent with GVHD.

To further evaluate the patient's condition, it is important to perform bronchoscopy and biopsy of the pulmonary lesions. This will help to determine the cause of the pulmonary infiltrates and guide further management. If the lesions are due to infection, the patient will need to be treated with antibiotics. If the lesions are due to drug toxicity, the patient will need to stop the offending drug. If the lesions are due to GVHD, the patient will need to be treated with corticosteroids.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Initiate empirical antiviral and antifungal therapy is incorrect because the patient's fevers have persisted despite antibiotic therapy. This suggests that the patient's fevers are not due to infection.
* Option B: Discontinue antibiotic therapy and consider systemic corticosteroids is incorrect because the patient's rash is consistent with a drug reaction. Discontinuation of the offending drug is the first step in treating a drug reaction.
* Option C: Obtain ferritin and soluble IL2Rα testing is incorrect because these tests are not helpful in diagnosing the cause of the patient's pulmonary infiltrates.

The patient's pain medication regimen includes methadone, immediate-release morphine, and gabapentin. Methadone is a long-acting opioid agonist that is used to treat chronic pain. Morphine is a short-acting opioid agonist that is used to treat acute pain. Gabapentin is an anticonvulsant that is used to treat neuropathic pain.

The urine drug screen results show that the patient is positive for methadone, morphine, hydromorphone, and codeine. Methadone, morphine, and hydromorphone are all opioids. Codeine is a non-opioid analgesic that is often used in combination with opioids.

The patient's pain medication regimen includes all of the drugs that were detected in the urine drug screen. Therefore, the patient is taking methadone, morphine, hydromorphone, and codeine.

A: The patient is taking methadone and morphine.

This answer is incorrect because the urine drug screen results also show that the patient is positive for hydromorphone and codeine.

Fournier gangrene is a rare, life-threatening necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum. It is most commonly caused by polymicrobial infection with gram-negative rods, such as Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Bacteroides fragilis. The patient in this case does not have any risk factors for Fournier gangrene, such as diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or immunosuppression. In addition, the patient's scrotal ulcerations did not develop until 12 days after the start of chemotherapy, which is too late for Fournier gangrene to develop.

A deep fungal infection is a possible diagnosis, but it is less likely than scrotal ulceration secondary to induction chemotherapy with ATRA. The patient's scrotal ulcerations did not respond to empiric antifungal therapy, which suggests that they are not caused by a fungal infection. In addition, the patient's peripheral blood cultures and skin swabs from the lesions did not identify a fungal infection.

A mycobacterial infection is also a possible diagnosis, but it is less likely than scrotal ulceration secondary to induction chemotherapy with ATRA. The patient's scrotal ulcerations did not respond to empiric antibiotic therapy, which suggests that they are not caused by a mycobacterial infection. In addition, the patient's peripheral blood cultures and skin swabs from the lesions did not identify a mycobacterial infection.

The most likely diagnosis is scrotal ulceration secondary to induction chemotherapy with ATRA. This is a well-described complication of ATRA treatment, and the patient's clinical presentation is consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's scrotal ulcerations developed after the start of chemotherapy, and they did not respond to empiric antibiotic or antifungal therapy. In addition, the patient's peripheral blood cultures and skin swabs from the lesions did not identify a bacterial or fungal infection.

Explanation:

Malignant atrophic papulosis (MAP) is a rare, idiopathic, cutaneous disorder characterized by the development of asymptomatic, non-tender, 5- to 10-mm, porcelain-white atrophic papules with an erythematous halo. The lesions are typically distributed on the trunk, neck, and upper and lower extremities, and they may be associated with atrophic white scars. The diagnosis of MAP is made clinically, and it is confirmed by biopsy, which shows characteristic features of atrophic epidermis, wedge-shaped avascular necrosis in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue, and perivascular lymphocytic infiltration.

The etiology of MAP is unknown, but it is thought to be a clonal disorder of T cells. MAP is associated with an increased risk of lymphoma, and it is considered to be a paraneoplastic syndrome. The treatment of MAP is not well-established, but it may include topical corticosteroids, systemic corticosteroids, or other immunosuppressive agents.

The other options are incorrect because they do not fit the clinical presentation of the patient. Pancreatitis panniculitis is a rare, inflammatory disorder of the pancreas and subcutaneous fat. Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic, autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organ systems. Lymphomatoid papulosis is a rare, chronic, cutaneous disorder characterized by the development of recurrent, self-healing papules.

**Explanation:**

The patient in the case presented with a 1-year history of pruritic erythema on the trunk and extremities. The erythema did not respond to topical corticosteroid, oral roxithromycin (300 mg/d), or narrow-band UV-B phototherapy. The patient had a history of type 2 diabetes and hypertension and was treated with glimepiride, sitagliptin phosphate hydrate, and amlodipine besylate. The patient also had polymyalgia, which was treated with a low dose of prednisolone. The prednisolone therapy had been discontinued 2 months before her visit to the dermatology clinic when she had been hospitalized with pneumonia. Multiple tense blisters had subsequently appeared on the palms. Physical examination at the first visit revealed scaly erythematous plaques on the whole body and tense blisters on the arms, hands, soles, and buttocks. Neither scar formation or mucosal involvement was observed. A skin biopsy specimen was obtained from a bulla on the forearm. Histopathologic analysis revealed a subepidermal bulla with inflammatory infiltrates of neutrophils. The results of an IgG chemiluminescence enzyme immunoassay for bullous pemphigoid (BP) 180 noncollagenous (NC) 16A were negative. After treatment with oral prednisolone, 20 mg/d, the lesions healed without scar or milia formation.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is linear IgA dermatosis. Linear IgA dermatosis is a subepidermal autoimmune bullous disease characterized by the deposition of linear IgA antibodies at the basement membrane zone. It is most commonly seen in adults, but can also occur in children. The most common presentation is of tense blisters on the hands, feet, and buttocks. The blisters may also occur on the trunk and extremities. The disease is usually self-limited, but can recur. Treatment is with oral corticosteroids, which usually result in rapid resolution of the lesions.

The other possible diagnoses in this case are bullous pemphigoid, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, and anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid. Bullous pemphigoid is a subepidermal autoimmune bullous disease characterized by the deposition of IgG antibodies at the basement membrane zone. It is the most common autoimmune bullous disease, and is most commonly seen in elderly people. The most common presentation is of tense blisters on the trunk and extremities. The blisters may also occur on the mucous membranes. The disease is usually chronic, and treatment is with oral corticosteroids. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita is a subepidermal autoimmune bullous disease characterized by the deposition of IgG antibodies at the anchoring fibrils. It is most commonly seen in adults, but can also occur in children. The most common presentation is of blisters that are easily traumatized, particularly on the hands and feet. The disease is usually chronic, and treatment is with oral corticosteroids. Anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid is a subepidermal autoimmune bullous disease characterized by the deposition of IgG antibodies against laminin γ1. It is most commonly seen in adults, but can also occur in children. The most common presentation is of blisters on the hands and feet. The disease is usually chronic, and treatment is with oral corticosteroids.

In this case, the patient's history and physical examination are most consistent with linear IgA dermatosis. The patient's blisters were on the hands, feet, and buttocks, which are common sites for linear IgA dermatosis. The patient's blisters were also subepidermal, which is characteristic of linear IgA dermatosis. The patient's blisters did not scar, which is also characteristic of linear IgA dermatosis. The patient's blisters responded to treatment with oral corticosteroids, which is the standard treatment for linear IgA dermatosis.

The patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with bullous pemphigoid. Bullous pemphigoid is more likely to cause blisters on the trunk and extremities, and is more likely to scar. Bullous pemphigoid is also more likely to be chronic, and is not as responsive to treatment with oral corticosteroids.

The patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita is more likely to cause blisters that are easily traumatized, particularly on the hands and feet. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita is also more likely to be chronic, and is not as responsive to treatment with oral corticosteroids.

The patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid. Anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid is more likely to cause blisters on the hands and feet. Anti–laminin γ1 pemphigoid is also more likely to be chronic, and is not as responsive to treatment with oral corticosteroids.

Explanation:

Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS) is a rare, autosomal dominant autoinflammatory disorder characterized by recurrent fevers, urticaria, arthralgias, and sensorineural hearing loss. It is caused by mutations in the NOD2 gene, which encodes a protein involved in the innate immune response.

The clinical features of MWS usually begin in childhood, with recurrent fevers, urticaria, and arthralgias. The fevers are typically high-grade (>39°C) and last for 3-5 days. The urticaria is nonpruritic and typically involves the trunk, extremities, and face. The arthralgias are usually migratory and involve small joints. Sensorineural hearing loss is a late-onset feature of MWS and can be progressive.

The diagnosis of MWS is based on clinical features and genetic testing. There is no cure for MWS, but treatment can help to control the symptoms. Treatment typically includes nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), colchicine, and anakinra.

The other options are incorrect because they do not fit the clinical features of the case. Chronic urticaria is a common skin condition characterized by hives that last for more than 6 weeks. Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS) is a rare, autosomal dominant autoinflammatory disorder characterized by recurrent fevers, urticaria, arthralgias, and flushing after exposure to cold temperatures. Neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disorder (NOMID) is a rare, autosomal recessive autoinflammatory disorder characterized by fever, rash, lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, and coagulopathy.

Explanation:

The patient's presentation is consistent with compartment syndrome. She has a history of an unsuccessful attempt to insert a PICC line into the right basilic vein, which is a common site for this complication. She developed right upper extremity pain and swelling the following day, which are also classic symptoms of compartment syndrome. On physical examination, she had tense and tender swelling of the right upper extremity that was more marked in the upper arm and caused significant impairment in motor function. This is consistent with the increased pressure in the compartment that can lead to nerve and muscle damage. The right radial pulse was absent, which is a late sign of compartment syndrome. Duplex ultrasonographic imaging of the right upper extremity demonstrated a 12.8 × 2.6-cm heterogeneous fluid collection with active color flow. This is consistent with an intracompartmental hematoma, which is a common complication of compartment syndrome.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Extensive deep vein thrombosis of the upper extremity is unlikely given the patient's history and presentation. She did not have any risk factors for deep vein thrombosis, such as prolonged immobilization or a history of clotting disorders. Additionally, deep vein thrombosis would not typically cause the patient's symptoms of pain, swelling, and motor impairment.
* Secondary lymphedema of the upper extremity is also unlikely given the patient's history and presentation. She did not have any risk factors for lymphedema, such as surgery or radiation therapy to the lymph nodes. Additionally, lymphedema would not typically cause the patient's symptoms of pain, swelling, and motor impairment.
* Brachial artery pseudoaneurysm is a rare complication of intravenous infusion therapy. It is typically caused by a puncture of the brachial artery during the insertion of the intravenous line. The patient's history and presentation are not consistent with a brachial artery pseudoaneurysm. She did not have any pain or swelling in the antecubital fossa, which is the typical location for a brachial artery pseudoaneurysm. Additionally, a brachial artery pseudoaneurysm would not typically cause the patient's symptoms of pain, swelling, and motor impairment.

Explanation:
The patient's history of smoking and chronic hypertension puts him at increased risk for the development of aneurysms. The CECT and mesenteric angiography findings show an intra-abdominal hyperdense mass and free fluid in the upper abdomen, as well as an aneurysm. These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of a ruptured peripancreatic pseudoaneurysm.

Hemorrhagic pancreatitis is a rare but serious complication of pancreatitis. It is characterized by bleeding into the pancreas and surrounding tissues. The patient's history and physical examination do not suggest that he is suffering from hemorrhagic pancreatitis.

Acute perforation of a bleeding peptic ulcer is a common cause of upper abdominal pain. The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with this diagnosis, but the CECT and mesenteric angiography findings do not show any evidence of a perforated ulcer.

Rupture of a jejunal artery aneurysm is a rare but serious complication of abdominal aortic aneurysms. The patient's history and physical examination do not suggest that he is suffering from this condition, and the CECT and mesenteric angiography findings do not show any evidence of a jejunal artery aneurysm.

The patient has a choroidal mass that is causing a shallow anterior chamber and elevated intraocular pressure. The mass is non-enhancing on MRI, which suggests that it is not a tumor. The most likely diagnosis is a serous choroidal detachment, which is a condition in which fluid accumulates between the choroid and the retina. Sclerotomies are a surgical procedure that is used to treat serous choroidal detachments by creating small openings in the sclera (the white of the eye) to allow fluid to drain.

A fine-needle aspiration biopsy is not necessary in this case because the diagnosis is already clear. Plaque radiotherapy is a treatment option for choroidal tumors, but it is not effective for serous choroidal detachments. Oral corticosteroids are a treatment option for inflammatory conditions, but they are not effective for serous choroidal detachments.

Therefore, the best course of treatment for this patient is to proceed with sclerotomies. This will allow the fluid to drain and relieve the pressure on the optic nerve, which should improve the patient's vision.

The patient is a 11-year-old boy who presented with impaired vision after an episode of fever and vomiting. Ophthalmologic examination revealed bilateral mydriasis, with a reduced pupillary response to light and accommodation. Diluted norepinephrine (0.1%) was instilled in both eyes, which elicited supersensitive dilatation of the pupils bilaterally owing to reinnervation and upregulation of the postsynaptic receptors, consistent with tonic pupils. Uncorrected Snellen visual acuity was 20/32 OU for distance and 20/200 OU for near. Ocular motility was normal. Results of slitlamp examination and ophthalmoscopy showed no abnormalities.

The patient's history and examination are consistent with autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy. Autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy is a rare, acquired disorder of the autonomic nervous system. It is characterized by progressive autonomic dysfunction, including pupillary abnormalities, gastrointestinal, urinary, and sexual dysfunction, and orthostatic hypotension. The diagnosis is made based on the clinical presentation and supported by laboratory testing, such as a positive anti-ganglioside antibody test.

The treatment for autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy is supportive. Treatment may include medications to manage the symptoms, such as midodrine for orthostatic hypotension, and physical therapy to help with rehabilitation. In some cases, immunosuppressive therapy may be necessary.

The patient in this case should have a blood sample drawn to investigate for autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy. This is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient.

The other options are not appropriate next steps in the management of this patient. Prescribing phototropic variofocal glasses would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Starting pilocarpine eyedrops would not be helpful in this case, as the patient's pupils are already dilated. Recommending genetic testing is not appropriate at this time, as there is no evidence that the patient has a genetic disorder.

The patient has a peaked pupil, which is a sign of peripheral anterior synechiae (PAS). PAS is a condition in which the iris adheres to the trabecular meshwork, which can block the flow of aqueous humor and lead to glaucoma. In this case, the patient also has pain in the eye, which is a common symptom of glaucoma.

An ultrasonographic biomicroscopy (UBM) is a non-invasive imaging technique that can be used to evaluate the anterior segment of the eye. UBM can be used to diagnose PAS and to assess the severity of the condition. In this case, UBM would be helpful to confirm the diagnosis of PAS and to determine whether the patient needs treatment for glaucoma.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Continuing to administer mitomycin C could make the patient's condition worse. Mitomycin C is a chemotherapy drug that is used to treat conjunctival melanoma. However, it can also damage the trabecular meshwork and lead to glaucoma.
* Option C: Biopsying the limbal area around 9:30 would not be helpful in this case. The patient has already had a biopsy of the area, and the results were negative for atypia.
* Option D: Delaying mitomycin C therapy would not be helpful in this case. The patient is already experiencing pain, and delaying treatment could make her condition worse.

The patient's history of bilateral peripheral visual field loss, which has remained unchanged for 5 years, is concerning for glaucoma. Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that damage the optic nerve and can lead to vision loss. The most common type of glaucoma is open-angle glaucoma, which is caused by a build-up of fluid in the eye. This build-up of fluid can damage the optic nerve and lead to vision loss.

The patient's visual field testing reveals bilateral inferior arcuate defects, which are consistent with glaucoma. The patient's intraocular pressure is also elevated, which is another risk factor for glaucoma.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the best test to diagnose glaucoma. MRI can show the optic nerve and the structures around it. This can help to determine if the patient has glaucoma and the extent of the damage to the optic nerve.

The other options are incorrect because they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's visual field loss. Reassuring the patient that the visual field loss is due to remote ischemic optic neuropathy is incorrect because the patient's history and examination findings are not consistent with this diagnosis. Reassuring the patient that the visual field loss is due to congenitally anomalous optic nerves is incorrect because the patient's history and examination findings are not consistent with this diagnosis. Performing selective laser trabeculoplasty is incorrect because the patient does not have open-angle glaucoma.

Explanation:

Erysipelas is a bacterial skin infection caused by group A streptococcus. It is characterized by a well-demarcated, erythematous, and edematous plaque with a raised border. The lesions are typically warm and tender to palpation. Erysipelas can occur anywhere on the body, but it is most common on the extremities and the face.

The patient in the case presentation presents with a 3-month history of a progressive, asymptomatic cutaneous eruption on her chest and back. The lesions are warm and indurated but nontender to palpation. The patient has a history of breast cancer, which is a risk factor for erysipelas. The physical examination findings and the patient's history are consistent with a diagnosis of erysipelas.

Carcinoma erysipeloides is a rare condition that is characterized by the development of erysipelas-like lesions in the setting of metastatic breast cancer. The lesions of carcinoma erysipeloides are typically nontender and are associated with systemic symptoms such as fever, chills, and malaise. The diagnosis of carcinoma erysipeloides is made by biopsy of the skin lesion.

Radiation dermatitis is a skin condition that can occur after exposure to radiation therapy. The lesions of radiation dermatitis are typically erythematous, edematous, and tender. Radiation dermatitis can occur anywhere on the body that was exposed to radiation therapy.

Radiation-induced morphea is a rare condition that can occur after exposure to radiation therapy. The lesions of radiation-induced morphea are typically indurated, atrophic, and hypopigmented. Radiation-induced morphea can occur anywhere on the body that was exposed to radiation therapy.

In conclusion, the patient in the case presentation most likely has erysipelas. The diagnosis of erysipelas is supported by the patient's history, the physical examination findings, and the laboratory results.

Therefore, it is important to perform a skeletal survey and refer for ophthalmologic consultation to rule out these syndromes.

Topical antifungals would not be appropriate treatment for café au lait spots, as they are not caused by a fungal infection. Taking a more detailed drug history is not necessary, as the patient's history is unremarkable. Stroking the skin lesion would not provide any useful information.

Explanation:

The patient's history of hypertension and elevated serum creatinine are consistent with chronic kidney disease. The presence of red blood cells, white blood cells, and protein in the urine suggests that the patient has glomerulonephritis, a kidney disease that affects the glomeruli, which are tiny blood vessels that filter waste products from the blood. The presence of casts in the urine is also consistent with glomerulonephritis.

Proliferative glomerulonephritis is a type of glomerulonephritis that is characterized by an increase in the number of cells in the glomeruli. This can lead to damage to the glomeruli and impaired kidney function.

The other possible diagnoses are not as likely as proliferative glomerulonephritis based on the patient's history and physical examination. Urinary tract infection is a possible diagnosis, but the patient's history and physical examination do not suggest that this is the most likely diagnosis. Nonproliferative glomerulonephritis is a type of glomerulonephritis that is characterized by a decrease in the number of cells in the glomeruli. This is less likely than proliferative glomerulonephritis based on the patient's history and physical examination. Hypertensive nephrosclerosis is a type of kidney disease that is caused by high blood pressure. This is less likely than proliferative glomerulonephritis based on the patient's history and physical examination.

Pemphigus foliaceus is an autoimmune blistering disorder characterized by flaccid blisters and erosions on the scalp, face, and upper trunk. It is the most common form of pemphigus, accounting for about 80% of cases.

The patient in the case presentation presents with multiple erythematous crusted plaques on her trunk that had appeared 4 weeks previously, sparing her limbs and facial region. This is consistent with the clinical presentation of pemphigus foliaceus.

The patient also has a long-standing history of several outbreaks of skin lesions limited to both axillae and groin. This is also consistent with pemphigus foliaceus, as the disease is often recurrent.

The patient's physical examination revealed multiple annular erythematous plaques surrounded by a peripheral crusted and pustular collarette on her trunk. This is a classic finding in pemphigus foliaceus.

A biopsy specimen was taken from the periphery of the lesion for hematoxylin-eosin stain and direct immunofluorescence. The hematoxylin-eosin stain revealed suprabasilar acantholysis, which is a characteristic finding in pemphigus foliaceus. The direct immunofluorescence showed IgG and C3 deposits at the dermoepidermal junction, which is another characteristic finding in pemphigus foliaceus.

A skin swab specimen from a pustular lesion was taken for microbiological culture. The culture was negative, which rules out infection as a cause of the patient's skin lesions.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is pemphigus foliaceus.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Generalized Hailey-Hailey disease is a genetic disorder characterized by flaccid blisters and erosions on the flexural surfaces of the skin. It is not associated with suprabasilar acantholysis or IgG and C3 deposits at the dermoepidermal junction.
* IgA pemphigus is a rare autoimmune blistering disorder characterized by subcorneal blisters and erosions. It is not associated with suprabasilar acantholysis or IgG and C3 deposits at the dermoepidermal junction.
* Pemphigus vulgaris is a severe autoimmune blistering disorder characterized by flaccid blisters and erosions on the mucous membranes and skin. It is associated with suprabasilar acantholysis and IgG and C3 deposits at the dermoepidermal junction. However, the patient in the case presentation does not have any oral or genital lesions, which are common in pemphigus vulgaris.

Explanation:
The most likely diagnosis is oral melanocytic nevus. This is a benign lesion that is characterized by a proliferation of melanocytes in the epithelium. The lesions are usually asymptomatic and are often discovered incidentally. The clinical appearance of oral melanocytic nevi can vary, but they are typically small, smooth, and pigmented lesions. The diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical appearance and histopathologic findings. Oral melanocytic nevi are generally not associated with any significant risk of malignant transformation. However, in some cases, they can progress to melanoma. Therefore, it is important to monitor these lesions closely for any changes in size, shape, or color.

Oral malignant melanoma is a rare but aggressive form of cancer that arises from melanocytes in the oral mucosa. The lesions are typically black or brown and can be either nodular or ulcerated. They can occur anywhere in the mouth, but are most common on the hard palate and gingiva. Oral malignant melanoma is associated with a poor prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate of less than 50%.

Oral melanoacanthoma is a rare, benign neoplasm that is characterized by a proliferation of melanocytes and keratinocytes. The lesions are typically brown or black and can be either nodular or plaque-like. They can occur anywhere in the mouth, but are most common on the lips and buccal mucosa. Oral melanoacanthoma is not associated with any significant risk of malignant transformation.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is oral melanocytic nevus. This is a benign lesion that is characterized by a proliferation of melanocytes in the epithelium. The lesions are usually asymptomatic and are often discovered incidentally. The clinical appearance of oral melanocytic nevi can vary, but they are typically small, smooth, and pigmented lesions.

Herpes simplex virus is the most likely diagnosis because the patient has a vesicular rash on the lower back and left thigh, which are typical features of herpes simplex virus infection. The patient is also neutropenic, which puts her at increased risk for infection with herpes simplex virus.

Disseminated varicella zoster virus is less likely because the patient does not have a history of chickenpox. Listeriosis is less likely because the patient does not have any of the typical features of listeriosis, such as fever, headache, and stiff neck. Cutaneous Bacillus cereus infection is less likely because the patient does not have any of the typical features of cutaneous Bacillus cereus infection, such as fever, chills, and muscle aches.

The following are the reasons why herpes simplex virus is the most likely diagnosis:

* The patient has a vesicular rash on the lower back and left thigh, which are typical features of herpes simplex virus infection.
* The patient is neutropenic, which puts her at increased risk for infection with herpes simplex virus.
* The patient's history is consistent with herpes simplex virus infection. She has no history of chickenpox, which would make varicella zoster virus infection less likely. She also does not have any of the typical features of listeriosis or cutaneous Bacillus cereus infection.

The following are the reasons why disseminated varicella zoster virus is less likely:

* The patient does not have a history of chickenpox.
* The patient does not have any of the typical features of disseminated varicella zoster virus infection, such as fever, headache, and stiff neck.

The following are the reasons why listeriosis is less likely:

* The patient does not have any of the typical features of listeriosis, such as fever, headache, and stiff neck.
* The patient's history is not consistent with listeriosis. She has no history of exposure to listeria.

The following are the reasons why cutaneous Bacillus cereus infection is less likely:

* The patient does not have any of the typical features of cutaneous Bacillus cereus infection, such as fever, chills, and muscle aches.
* The patient's history is not consistent with cutaneous Bacillus cereus infection. She has no history of exposure to Bacillus cereus.

Neurocutaneous melanosis (NCL) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple congenital nevi (moles) and tumors of the nervous system. The lesions in NCL are often pigmented and can be found on the skin, eyes, and brain. The tumors of the nervous system can be benign or malignant, and they can cause a variety of neurological problems, including seizures, developmental delay, and mental retardation.

The patient in this case has a history of multiple congenital nevi, which is a characteristic finding in NCL. She also has multiple parenchymal lesions involving the pons, bilateral amygdala, and the left temporal pole. These lesions are consistent with the tumors that are seen in NCL. The patient's headache and memory problems are also consistent with the neurological problems that can be caused by NCL.

The other options are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's history, physical examination findings, or imaging studies. Metastatic melanoma is a cancer that spreads from the skin to other parts of the body, including the brain. Primary intracranial melanoma is a rare type of cancer that starts in the brain.

Necrotizing fasciitis is a serious infection of the skin and underlying tissues that can lead to death if not treated promptly. It is caused by bacteria that enter the body through a break in the skin, such as a cut or puncture wound. The bacteria then multiply and release toxins that destroy the surrounding tissue.

The symptoms of necrotizing fasciitis include:

* Rapidly spreading redness, swelling, and pain
* Fever
* Chills
* Vomiting
* Diarrhea
* Shock

If you think you may have necrotizing fasciitis, it is important to seek medical attention immediately. Treatment typically involves antibiotics and surgery to remove the infected tissue.

The other possible answers are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Pyomyositis is an infection of the muscle, not the skin.
* Nicolau syndrome (livedoid dermatitis) is a rare skin condition that is not caused by infection.
* Retained foreign body could be a cause of the patient's symptoms, but it is less likely than necrotizing fasciitis given the history and physical examination findings.

Explanation: The patient is a 4-year-old girl with a history of prematurity who presents with acute right lower quadrant abdominal pain. She has a mild leukocytosis and a normal urinalysis. Abdominal ultrasonography fails to show her appendix and demonstrates no secondary signs of inflammation. Computed tomography images of the abdomen and pelvis show an inflamed retrocecal mass. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of perforated appendicitis.

Meckel diverticulitis is a rare condition in children that is characterized by inflammation of a Meckel diverticulum, a small, blind pouch that can develop from the ileum. Meckel diverticulitis can present with abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. However, it is typically not associated with leukocytosis or a positive urinalysis.

Crohn disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract. Crohn disease can present with abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and fever. However, it is typically not associated with leukocytosis or a positive urinalysis.

Ectopic ovarian torsion is a rare condition in which an ovary twists on its own blood supply, resulting in ischemia and necrosis of the ovary.

Descending necrotizing mediastinitis (DNM) is a rare, life-threatening infection of the mediastinum, a central compartment of the chest that contains the heart, lungs, esophagus, and other important structures. It is most commonly caused by anaerobic bacteria, such as Bacteroides species, but can also be caused by other bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus.

DNM is typically preceded by an infection in the head, neck, or upper respiratory tract. The infection then spreads to the mediastinum through the bloodstream or lymphatic system. The infection can cause inflammation, necrosis (death of tissue), and abscess formation in the mediastinum.

The most common symptoms of DNM are fever, chest pain, and shortness of breath. Other symptoms may include neck swelling, cough, difficulty swallowing, and hoarseness.

DNM is a medical emergency and requires immediate treatment with antibiotics and surgery. Without treatment, DNM can be fatal.

The patient in the case presented with several symptoms that are consistent with DNM, including fever, chest pain, shortness of breath, and neck swelling. The computed tomographic scan also showed evidence of mediastinal edema and bilateral pleural effusions, which are findings that are often seen in patients with DNM. The barium swallow showed no extravasation of contrast, which ruled out esophageal perforation.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is DNM.

 55%|█████▌    | 842/1525 [3:12:10<2:47:55, 14.75s/it]The correct answer is: **A: Initiate systemic corticosteroids.**

The patient presented with aseptic meningitis and unilateral blurred vision. The most likely cause of the blurred vision is papilledema, which is swelling of the optic disc. Papilledema is a sign of increased intracranial pressure, which can be caused by a number of conditions, including aseptic meningitis. Systemic corticosteroids are the first-line treatment for papilledema. They reduce inflammation and lower intracranial pressure.

Intraocular corticosteroid injections are not typically used to treat papilledema. They can be used to treat inflammation of the optic nerve, but they are not as effective as systemic corticosteroids for reducing intracranial pressure.

Evaluating for systemic infectious disease is important, but it is not the most urgent treatment. The patient is already being treated for aseptic meningitis, and the most likely cause of the blurred vision is papilledema.

Beginning intravenous acyclovir is not appropriate for this patient. Acyclovir is used to treat herpes simplex virus encephalitis, which is a rare cause of aseptic meningitis. The patient does not have any symptoms of herpes simplex virus encephalitis, and her cerebrospinal fluid studies are negative for herpes simplex virus.

Therefore, the most appropriate treatment for this patient is to initiate systemic corticosteroids.

 55%|█████▌    | 843/1525 [3:12:26<2:53:06, 15.23s/it]The correct answer is: **B: Explore, irrigate, and close the wound.**

The patient has a deep midfacial laceration with a significant amount of clear fluid draining from the wound site. This suggests that the laceration may have injured the nasolacrimal system. The nasolacrimal system is a drainage system for tears. It consists of the lacrimal gland, which produces tears; the lacrimal ducts, which carry tears from the eyes to the nose; and the nasolacrimal sac, which stores tears before they drain into the nose.

If the nasolacrimal system is injured, tears may leak from the wound. This can cause irritation and infection. It is important to explore, irrigate, and close the wound to prevent these complications.

Exploring the wound involves opening it up and looking inside to see if the nasolacrimal system is injured. Irrigating the wound involves washing it out with sterile saline solution. Closing the wound involves suturing it shut.

Orders for computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the head are not necessary in this case. CT and MRI are imaging tests that can be used to diagnose injuries to the brain, skull, or other internal organs. However, the patient does not have any symptoms that suggest an injury to these areas. The clear fluid draining from the wound is most likely coming from the nasolacrimal system, not from an internal injury. Therefore, CT or MRI is not necessary.

The patient's history is important in order to determine the cause of the retinal whitening. It is possible that the retinal whitening is due to a number of different causes, including inflammation, infection, or autoimmune disease. Obtaining more information on the patient's history, such as their medical history, medications, and allergies, can help to narrow down the possible causes and guide treatment.

A systemic steroid injection is not the appropriate treatment for retinal whitening in the absence of inflammation. Foscarnet is an antiviral medication that is used to treat herpes simplex virus retinitis. It is not the appropriate treatment for retinal whitening in the absence of evidence of herpes simplex virus infection. Infectious and autoimmune workup may be necessary, but should not be the first step in the evaluation of a patient with retinal whitening.

The patient's pacemaker is programmed to a DDDR (dual-chamber, rate-adaptive) pacing mode with an AV delay of 300 milliseconds and tracking rates from 60 to 110 pulses per minute. The postventricular atrial refractory period is programmed to 200 milliseconds.

The postventricular atrial refractory period (PVARP) is a programmable parameter in dual-chamber pacemakers that determines the minimum amount of time that must elapse between the ventricular pacing stimulus and the next atrial pacing stimulus. The PVARP is designed to prevent ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation by ensuring that there is always an adequate time period for the ventricles to recover from the previous ventricular pacing stimulus.

In this case, the patient's PVARP is programmed to 200 milliseconds. This is a relatively short PVARP, which could increase the risk of ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. Therefore, the PVARP should be increased to 250 milliseconds to reduce the risk of these arrhythmias.

The other options are incorrect because they would not address the underlying problem, which is a short PVARP. Increasing the atrial pacing rate would not prevent ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. Shortening the programmed AV delay would not increase the time period for the ventricles to recover from the previous ventricular pacing stimulus. Referring the patient for pacemaker lead revision would not be necessary unless there is a problem with the pacemaker lead itself.

In conclusion, the correct answer is: **C. Increase the postventricular atrial refractory period to 250 milliseconds.**

Explanation: The patient's history of IgGκ multiple myeloma, the presence of multiple painful cutaneous nodules, and the immunohistochemical findings of a monoclonal plasma cell population in the biopsy specimens are all consistent with a diagnosis of plasmacytoma.

Hemangiomas are benign tumors of blood vessels. They are typically red or purple in color and can occur anywhere on the body. Neutrophilic dermatoses are a group of skin diseases characterized by the accumulation of neutrophils in the skin. They can cause a variety of symptoms, including redness, swelling, and itching. Leukemia cutis is a rare skin condition that occurs in patients with leukemia. It is characterized by the presence of leukemia cells in the skin.

The patient's history and physical examination findings are not consistent with a diagnosis of hemangioma, neutrophilic dermatoses, or leukemia cutis. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is plasmacytoma.

The patient has a number of risk factors for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, including granulomatous polyangiitis, end-stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis, and mild pulmonary fibrosis. However, his blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid test results are negative for Aspergillus galactomannan, which is a sensitive marker for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. Additionally, he does not have any clinical features of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, such as fever, chills, or worsening dyspnea. Therefore, it is most likely that the patient's test results reflect colonization with Aspergillus rather than invasive infection.

A. The patient has proven invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. This is incorrect because the patient's blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid test results are negative for Aspergillus galactomannan.

B. The patient has probable invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. This is incorrect because the patient does not have any clinical features of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.

D. The patient is not at risk for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and the results reflect colonization. This is correct because the patient has a number of risk factors for invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, but his test results are negative for Aspergillus galactomannan and he does not have any clinical features of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.

Explanation:
The most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is to obtain a biopsy for hematoxylin-eosin stain. This will allow for a definitive diagnosis of the lesion, which is essential for the initiation of appropriate therapy. The other options are not as appropriate. Obtaining a biopsy for fungal culture is not necessary, as the lesion is not typical of a fungal infection. Treating with cryotherapy or pulsed dye laser therapy is premature, as a definitive diagnosis has not yet been made.

 56%|█████▌    | 849/1525 [3:13:35<2:12:17, 11.74s/it]The correct answer is **B: The patient is not using hydrocodone but may be using cocaine.**

The patient reported no recent illicit substance or drug use and stated her last dose of hydrocodone was that day. However, the urine immunoassay drug screen showed a positive result for cocaine. This could mean that the patient is using cocaine, but it is also possible that she was exposed to cocaine second-hand, such as by being around someone who was smoking crack cocaine. Additionally, the urine immunoassay drug screen is not a perfect test and can sometimes give false-positive results. Therefore, it is important to consider all of the evidence before making a definitive diagnosis.

The patient's history of cocaine use is a risk factor for opioid misuse, but it is not a guarantee that she will misuse hydrocodone. The patient's pain is well-controlled with hydrocodone, and she has not had any problems with opioid misuse in the past. Additionally, the patient is taking hydrocodone as prescribed, and she is not taking any other medications that could interact with hydrocodone. Therefore, it is unlikely that the patient is misusing hydrocodone.

It is possible that the patient is using cocaine, but the evidence is not conclusive. The patient's history of cocaine use is a risk factor for cocaine misuse, but it is not a guarantee that she is using cocaine. Additionally, the urine immunoassay drug screen is not a perfect test and can sometimes give false-positive results. Therefore, it is important to continue to monitor the patient for signs of cocaine use. If the patient continues to report no recent illicit substance or drug use and the urine immunoassay drug screen continues to show a positive result for cocaine, then it may be necessary to perform additional testing, such as a gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) test, to confirm the presence of cocaine.

 56%|█████▌    | 850/1525 [3:13:45<2:07:08, 11.30s/it]The correct answer is: **B. Results should be repeated in 12 weeks to confirm diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome.**

The antiphospholipid syndrome is a disorder characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (APLAs) and recurrent thromboembolic events. APLAs are antibodies that bind to phospholipids, which are a type of fat found in cell membranes. These antibodies can interfere with the body's ability to form blood clots, which can lead to thrombosis.

The diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome is based on the presence of APLAs and a history of thromboembolic events. The most common APLAs are anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL) and anti-β2 glycoprotein I antibodies (anti-β2GPI). These antibodies can be detected in the blood using a variety of tests.

The diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome is confirmed if a person has two or more positive APLA tests and a history of thromboembolic events. The thromboembolic events can occur in any part of the body, but they are most commonly seen in the veins of the legs (deep vein thrombosis) and the lungs (pulmonary embolism).

The treatment of antiphospholipid syndrome is aimed at preventing further thromboembolic events. This is usually done with anticoagulant therapy, such as warfarin or heparin. Anticoagulants work by preventing the formation of blood clots.

The prognosis for people with antiphospholipid syndrome is generally good with treatment. However, the condition can be life-threatening if not treated.

In the case presented, the patient has a history of ischemic stroke, which is a thromboembolic event. He also has elevated titers of aCL and anti-β2GPI antibodies. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome. However, the diagnosis cannot be confirmed without a history of thromboembolic events. Therefore, the results should be repeated in 12 weeks to confirm the diagnosis.

A: Results are sufficient to diagnose antiphospholipid syndrome.
This is incorrect because the diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome requires a history of thromboembolic events.

C: Results are uninterpretable due to heparin therapy.
This is incorrect because heparin therapy does not affect the results of APLA tests.

D: Results are uninterpretable due to warfarin therapy.
This is incorrect because warfarin therapy can affect the results of APLA tests, but it is not likely to do so in this case. The patient has only been taking warfarin for a short period of time, and the results of the APLA tests were obtained before he started taking warfarin.

The patient presents with a number of clinical features that are characteristic of mastocytosis, including leonine facies, flushing, diarrhea, and seborrheic hyperplasia. The biopsy specimen from the skin of the forehead shows a sparse lymphocytic infiltrate close to follicular structure along with sebaceous hyperplasia. This is consistent with the diagnosis of mastocytosis, as mast cells are found in close proximity to hair follicles. The CT scan shows multiple metastatic hepatic masses, which is also a common finding in mastocytosis.

Leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae. It is characterized by skin lesions, nerve damage, and loss of sensation. Diarrhea is not a common symptom of leprosy.

Carcinoid syndrome is a rare condition that occurs when tumors of the endocrine system produce excessive amounts of hormones. Symptoms of carcinoid syndrome include flushing, diarrhea, wheezing, and heart palpitations. Leonine facies is not a common symptom of carcinoid syndrome.

Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease caused by the protozoan Leishmania. It is characterized by skin lesions, fever, and weight loss. Diarrhea is not a common symptom of leishmaniasis.

In conclusion, the patient's clinical presentation and the findings of the biopsy and CT scan are most consistent with the diagnosis of mastocytosis.

Explanation:

Duhring disease, also known as dermatitis herpetiformis, is a chronic, autoimmune blistering skin disease characterized by small, itchy blisters on the skin, usually on the elbows, knees, buttocks, and scalp. The blisters are often grouped together in a circinate or annular pattern, as described in the case.

Tinea corporis, also known as ringworm, is a fungal infection of the skin that can cause ring-shaped, scaly lesions. The lesions are often red and inflamed, and may be itchy. Tinea corporis is not an autoimmune disease, and does not typically cause blisters.

IgA pemphigus is a rare, autoimmune blistering skin disease characterized by subcorneal blisters and an intense IgA deposition at the dermal-epidermal junction. The blisters are often widespread, and may be associated with oral and genital lesions. IgA pemphigus is not a good match for the case, as the patient does not have oral or genital lesions, and the blisters are not widespread.

Psoriasis pustulosa is a rare, severe form of psoriasis characterized by pustules on the skin. The pustules are often associated with scaling, erythema, and inflammation. Psoriasis pustulosa is not a good match for the case, as the patient does not have pustules on the skin.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Duhring disease.

Explanation:

The patient is a 4-year-old girl with newly diagnosed acute lymphocytic leukemia, receiving her initial course of chemotherapy with vincristine, daunorubicin, and methotrexate. She developed a painful lesion on her left triceps, which was beneath an adhesive bandage placed where she had received DTaP (diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis) and polio vaccinations 3 weeks earlier. The lesion was tender and indurated, and it had a gray-violet color. The patient's white blood cell and neutrophil counts were low. Blood culture findings were negative. Punch biopsy specimens were obtained for histopathologic analysis and fungal culture.

The histopathologic examination of the biopsy specimen showed broad, nonseptate hyphae surrounding and infiltrating dermal blood vessels. This finding is characteristic of mucormycosis, a fungal infection that can occur in immunocompromised patients. The fungal culture grew Mucor species.

Mucormycosis is a serious infection that can be fatal if not treated promptly. The treatment for mucormycosis includes antifungal medications and surgical debridement of the infected tissue.

The other possible diagnoses are not as likely in this case. Cutaneous diphtheria is a bacterial infection that is typically characterized by a painful, ulcerated lesion on the skin. Pseudomonal ecthyma gangrenosum is a bacterial infection that is typically characterized by a rapidly spreading, necrotic skin lesion. Aspergillosis is a fungal infection that can occur in immunocompromised patients, but it is not typically associated with a painful, indurated lesion.

Explanation:

The most likely diagnosis for this neonate is herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. The history of preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) for 10 days and the presence of multiple, grouped vesicles and punched-out ulcerations on his scalp, axilla, extremities, and scrotum are classic findings of HSV infection in neonates. The initial laboratory evaluation findings of a high lymphocyte count (34%) and high aspartate aminotransferase level (117 IU/L) are also consistent with HSV infection. A chest radiograph demonstrating increased pulmonary markings bilaterally could be due to pneumonia, which is a common complication of HSV infection in neonates.

Candida albicans is a yeast that can cause candidiasis, a common skin infection in neonates. However, candidiasis typically presents as white, cheesy plaques on the mucous membranes, such as the mouth and diaper area. Transient neonatal pustular melanosis is a benign skin rash that is common in neonates. It presents as small, pustular lesions on the face, trunk, and extremities. Congenital varicella is a rare condition that occurs when a pregnant woman with varicella zoster virus (VZV) infection develops a rash during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. Congenital varicella can cause severe birth defects, including skin lesions, eye problems, and central nervous system problems.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for this neonate is HSV infection. The history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are all consistent with HSV infection.

Explanation:

The patient is a 28-year-old woman who presented with a sudden, diffuse, and painful enlargement of the upper quadrants of the left breast with edema and palpable axillary lymph nodes without clinical signs of inflammation or infection. She had neither fever nor skin redness but was experiencing fatigue. She had stopped breastfeeding 10 months before the emergency department admission, and she had a recent history of pneumonia self-medicated with antibiotics. She had no family history of breast or ovarian cancer and no history of drug addiction or hyaluronic acid or free silicone injections in the breast. She denied any trauma to the breast.

On physical examination, the patient had a 6-cm hard mass without nipple discharge or retraction and left axillary palpable lymph nodes. Breast ultrasonography revealed diffuse nonspecific hypoechogenicity of the breast tissue with periductal small cysts. Mammography revealed asymmetric density and distortion in the left upper quadrants.

Multiple 14-gauge ultrasound-guided biopsies in the upper quadrants of the left breast and fine-needle aspiration cytologic testing of an enlarged lymph node revealed granulomatous inflammation with epithelioid histiocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils. Lymph nodes were normal.

Blood test results were as follows: hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, human immunodeficiency virus enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and whole-blood interferon γ release assay (QuantiFERON), negative; IgG cytomegalovirus, positive; fibrinogen level, 234 mg/dL (to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 0.0294); erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 4 mm/h; leukocyte count, 7660/µL (to convert to ×109/L, multiply by 0.001); no acquired immunosuppression; and no hematologic disorders.

The most likely diagnosis is idiopathic granulomatous mastitis. This is a rare condition that typically affects women in their 30s and 40s. It is characterized by the formation of granulomas, which are small collections of inflammatory cells, in the breast tissue. The cause of idiopathic granulomatous mastitis is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder.

The treatment for idiopathic granulomatous mastitis is usually a combination of medications, such as corticosteroids and antibiotics. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the affected tissue. The prognosis for idiopathic granulomatous mastitis is generally good. With treatment, most women experience complete resolution of their symptoms.

The other possible diagnoses are inflammatory breast cancer, tuberculous mastitis, and mastitis caused by immunosuppression. However, these diagnoses are less likely given the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings.

Inflammatory breast cancer is a rare and aggressive type of breast cancer that typically presents with sudden, diffuse, and painful enlargement of the breast. The patient in this case does not have any of the classic risk factors for inflammatory breast cancer, such as a family history of breast cancer or a personal history of atypical ductal hyperplasia. Additionally, the patient's laboratory findings are not consistent with inflammatory breast cancer. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is typically elevated in inflammatory breast cancer, but it is normal in this patient.

Tuberculous mastitis is a rare infection of the breast caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is more common in developing countries than in developed countries. The patient in this case does not have any risk factors for tuberculous mastitis, such as travel to a developing country or contact with someone who has tuberculosis. Additionally, the patient's laboratory findings are not consistent with tuberculous mastitis. The ESR is typically elevated in tuberculous mastitis, but it is normal in this patient.

Mastitis caused by immunosuppression is a rare complication of immunosuppressive therapy. It is more common in patients who are receiving treatment for cancer, autoimmune disorders, or organ transplantation. The patient in this case does not have any risk factors for mastitis caused by immunosuppression. Additionally, the patient's laboratory findings are not consistent with mastitis caused by immunosuppression. The ESR is typically elevated in mastitis caused by immunosuppression, but it is normal in this patient.

Explanation:

* **Angiosarcoma** is a rare malignant tumor of the blood vessels. It is most commonly found in the skin, but can also occur in the liver, heart, and other organs. Angiosarcomas are highly aggressive tumors with a poor prognosis.
* **Leiomyosarcoma** is a rare malignant tumor of smooth muscle cells. It can occur in any organ that contains smooth muscle, but is most common in the uterus, stomach, and intestines. Leiomyosarcomas are typically slow-growing tumors, but can be aggressive and metastasize to other organs.
* **Pheochromocytoma** is a rare neuroendocrine tumor that originates in the adrenal glands. Pheochromocytomas are often associated with the symptoms of hypertension, headache, sweating, and palpitations. They can be benign or malignant, and can metastasize to other organs.
* **Unicentric Castleman disease** is a rare non-cancerous lymphoproliferative disorder that affects the lymph nodes. It is characterized by the enlargement of one or more lymph nodes, and can cause symptoms such as fever, fatigue, and weight loss. Unicentric Castleman disease is typically treated with surgery to remove the enlarged lymph nodes.

In this case, the patient is a 69-year-old man who presented with an incidental retroperitoneal mass. The mass was hypervascular, which suggests that it was supplied by a large number of blood vessels. This is consistent with the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma, which is a highly vascular tumor. The patient also had a slight elevation in normetanephrine levels, which is a hormone that is produced by pheochromocytomas. Additionally, the patient's symptoms were consistent with pheochromocytoma, including hypertension, headache, sweating, and palpitations.

Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is pheochromocytoma. The other options are less likely because they do not explain the patient's symptoms or the imaging findings.

The patient has a history of Alport syndrome, which is a genetic disorder that can cause kidney failure and vision problems. He has already been treated for keratouveitis, which is an inflammation of the cornea and the uvea, the middle layer of the eye. He now has some residual blurring of his vision in the right eye.

The patient's examination reveals a poor foveal light reflex with an irregular-shaped area of red discoloration in the fovea and surrounding subtle flecking of the retina in both eyes. No other abnormalities were found on ophthalmoscopic examination. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography showed an irregular foveal contour with trace epiretinal membrane formation, with no evidence of foveoschisis or outer retinal changes. Fundus autofluorescence was normal.

The findings on examination and optical coherence tomography are consistent with a diagnosis of pseudohole formation, which is a common finding in patients with Alport syndrome. Pseudoholes are not associated with significant visual loss and do not require treatment.

In this case, the best course of management is to observe the patient and repeat the spectral-domain optical coherence tomography in 6 months to 1 year. If the pseudoholes progress or if the patient develops any new visual symptoms, then further treatment may be necessary.

Answer B is incorrect because there is no evidence of active viral infection in the patient's eye. Aqueous/vitreous tap and injection of foscarnet intravitreally are treatments for active viral infections, such as herpes zoster ophthalmicus.

Answer A is incorrect because pars plana vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane peeling is a surgical procedure that is used to treat a variety of retinal conditions, including retinal detachment and macular holes. In this case, the patient does not have any of these conditions, so there is no need for surgery.

Answer D is incorrect because intravitreal injection of ocriplasmin is a treatment for macular holes. In this case, the patient does not have a macular hole, so there is no need for this treatment.

The patient's presentation is consistent with giant cell arteritis (GCA), a systemic vasculitis that typically affects patients over the age of 50. GCA can cause a variety of symptoms, including headache, scalp tenderness, jaw claudication, fever, weight loss, and visual disturbances. The most common visual finding in GCA is anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION), which is caused by inflammation of the optic nerve and can lead to sudden, painless vision loss.

In this case, the patient's history of jaw pain, weight loss, and vision loss is concerning for GCA. The physical examination findings of temporal artery tenderness and a small paracentral relative scotoma in the left eye are also consistent with GCA. The laboratory findings of an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) level are non-specific but support the diagnosis of GCA.

The treatment for GCA is high-dose systemic corticosteroids. The initial dose of prednisone is typically 1 mg/kg per day, which is then tapered over several months. Biopsy of the superficial temporal artery is often performed to confirm the diagnosis of GCA, but it is not always necessary if the clinical suspicion is high.

The other options are incorrect because they are not the standard treatment for GCA. Option A (Observe and recommend smoking cessation) is not appropriate because the patient's vision loss is likely due to GCA, which requires treatment with corticosteroids. Option B (Obtain a hypercoagulable laboratory workup) is not necessary because the patient's history and physical examination findings are not consistent with a hypercoagulable disorder. Option C (Perform diagnostic vitreous paracentesis and intravitreal antibiotic injection) is not appropriate because the patient's vision loss is not due to an infectious process.

The patient in this case has a circumscribed iris elevation in her right eye. This is a relatively common finding, and it is often not associated with any serious problems. In most cases, the elevation will resolve on its own without any treatment.

In some cases, the elevation may be caused by a more serious condition, such as a tumor. However, this is not likely in the patient in this case, as she does not have any other symptoms that suggest a tumor.

The best course of action in this case is to observe the elevation and repeat imaging in 6 months. This will allow the doctor to see if the elevation is resolving on its own. If it is not, then the doctor may need to perform further tests to determine the cause.

The other options are not as appropriate in this case. Option B, lesion biopsy, is not necessary as the patient does not have any symptoms that suggest a serious condition. Option C, systemic workup for occult malignancy, is also not necessary as the patient does not have any symptoms that suggest a systemic malignancy. Option D, attempt lesion rupture with neodymium-doped yttrium aluminum garnet laser, is not appropriate as it is not necessary to rupture the lesion and it could potentially make the problem worse.

 56%|█████▋    | 860/1525 [3:16:10<2:52:42, 15.58s/it]Answer: D. Perform a surgical drainage of the collection.

Explanation:

The patient has a history of Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome, which is a hereditary disorder characterized by arteriovenous malformations (AVMs). AVMs are abnormal connections between arteries and veins that can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most commonly found in the brain, spinal cord, and liver.

In this case, the patient developed a right orbital AVM after scuba diving. This is a known complication of scuba diving, as the pressure changes in the environment can cause AVMs to rupture. When an AVM ruptures, it can cause bleeding, swelling, and pressure within the orbit. This can lead to double vision, proptosis (bulging of the eye), and pain.

The patient's symptoms are consistent with a right orbital AVM. The MRI findings also show a fusiform heterogeneous peripherally enhancing extraconal mass within the superior orbit on the right, which is consistent with an AVM.

The treatment for a ruptured orbital AVM is surgical drainage of the collection. This is done to relieve the pressure within the orbit and prevent further damage to the eye. The surgery is usually performed under general anesthesia. The surgeon will make an incision in the eyelid and then drain the blood and clots from the AVM. The surgeon may also need to remove part of the AVM.

After surgery, the patient will need to wear an eye patch to protect the eye. They may also need to take medication to reduce swelling and pain. The patient will need to follow up with their doctor regularly to monitor the healing process.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Option A, observe, is not a definitive treatment for a ruptured orbital AVM. Option B, perform canthotomy and cantholysis, is a procedure that is used to open the eye socket. This procedure is not necessary in this case, as the patient does not have a retinal detachment. Option C, perform fine-needle aspiration, is a procedure that is used to remove fluid from a cyst or tumor. This procedure is not appropriate in this case, as the patient has a ruptured orbital AVM.

Explanation:

The patient is a 35-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and chronic lymphocytic leukemia who underwent allogenic bone marrow transplant approximately 9 months prior. Her bone marrow transplant had been complicated with severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) of skin and liver. She is currently being treated for an acute flare of chronic GVHD, which is complicated by diffuse alveolar hemorrhage. She is bradycardic to 40 beats per minute.

The patient's bradycardia is likely due to her GVHD. GVHD can cause a variety of cardiac arrhythmias, including bradycardia. The bradycardia is symptomatic, as the patient is complaining of shortness of breath.

The patient needs an emergent pacemaker to treat her bradycardia. A transvenous pacemaker is the preferred method of pacing in this patient because it is more reliable and has a lower risk of infection than a transcutaneous pacemaker.

The other options are not appropriate for this patient. Option A is not appropriate because the patient is symptomatic. Option B is not appropriate because the patient's bradycardia is likely due to her GVHD, and treatment of the GVHD will not resolve the bradycardia. Option D is not appropriate because a transcutaneous pacemaker is not as reliable or as safe as a transvenous pacemaker.

Explanation:
The patient in this case presented with a large, well-mucosalized mass emanating from the left pyriform sinus. The mass was nonenhancing on computed tomography scan, which suggests that it is a benign tumor. The microscopic examination of the mass revealed polygonal cells with peripherally placed nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm containing cross-striations. These findings are characteristic of granular cell tumors. Rhabdomyomas, paragangliomas, and hibernomas are all rare tumors that can occur in the larynx. However, they do not typically present with the same clinical features as the patient in this case. Rhabdomyomas are usually found in children and are often associated with tuberous sclerosis. Paragangliomas are typically found in the head and neck region and can be associated with pheochromocytoma. Hibernomas are usually found in the extremities and are often associated with cold intolerance.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for the patient in this case is granular cell tumor.

Explanation:

The patient in this case has a number of features that are consistent with leukemia cutis, including:

* A history of newly diagnosed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML)
* A recent onset of fever, cough, abdominal pain, difficulty swallowing, and 1 month of neutropenia
* A painful eruption on the scalp, face, and left leg that developed 24 hours prior to presentation
* Physical examination findings of multiple erythematous to violaceous, tender, edematous, targetoid nodules and plaques with central dusky appearance on the left forearm and right upper thigh
* Laboratory findings of a white blood cell count of 1.8 × 103/µL, an absolute neutrophil count of 246 cells/µL, and a cellular cytogenetics of AML that were notable for a 5q deletion and p53 mutation
* Histopathologic evaluation of punch biopsy specimens from the right arm and left thigh that showed a brisk neutrophilic infiltrate

Leukemia cutis is a rare but serious complication of leukemia that occurs when leukemic cells infiltrate the skin. It can be a sign of aggressive disease and is associated with a poor prognosis. The diagnosis of leukemia cutis is made based on clinical findings, histopathologic evaluation, and cytogenetic studies. Treatment typically involves chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.

Fusarium species infection and Bartonella henselae infection are both possible causes of the patient's skin lesions, but they are less likely than leukemia cutis given the patient's history and presentation. Sweet syndrome is a rare, febrile neutrophilic dermatosis that is not typically associated with leukemia.

Explanation:

The patient has a history of major depressive disorder and is currently experiencing symptoms of depression, including hopelessness, insomnia, and decreased energy. His mood had been controlled with bupropion, 300 mg/d, for the past several years; however, the recent death of his husband led to increased depressive symptoms. His total score on the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9) was 16, which is in the moderate range. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder.

Dysthymic disorder is a chronic form of depression that is characterized by less severe symptoms than major depressive disorder. The patient's symptoms do not meet the criteria for dysthymic disorder.

Depressive symptoms of at least moderate severity are a common finding in patients with major depressive disorder. The patient's symptoms meet the criteria for depressive symptoms of at least moderate severity.

Bipolar disorder is a mood disorder characterized by episodes of mania and depression. The patient does not have any symptoms of mania, so he does not have bipolar disorder.

The patient has a history of chronic hepatitis B infection, which is a risk factor for systemic vasculitis. The skin lesions are consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis, which is a type of systemic vasculitis. The patient also has arthralgias, which can be a symptom of systemic vasculitis. A skin biopsy showed extravasated erythrocytes, a neutrophilic infiltrate, fibrinoid necrosis, and broken-down neutrophils releasing nuclear debris, which are all findings consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis. A second skin punch biopsy was performed for direct immunofluorescence, which was negative. This finding does not rule out the diagnosis of systemic vasculitis, as direct immunofluorescence is not always positive in cases of leukocytoclastic vasculitis. Results of a complete blood cell count and comprehensive metabolic panel were unremarkable. These findings do not provide any evidence to support the diagnosis of systemic vasculitis.

In conclusion, the patient has a history of chronic hepatitis B infection, which is a risk factor for systemic vasculitis. The skin lesions are consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis, which is a type of systemic vasculitis. The patient also has arthralgias, which can be a symptom of systemic vasculitis. A skin biopsy showed findings consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis. A second skin punch biopsy was performed for direct immunofluorescence, which was negative. This finding does not rule out the diagnosis of systemic vasculitis. Results of a complete blood cell count and comprehensive metabolic panel were unremarkable. These findings do not provide any evidence to support the diagnosis of systemic vasculitis. Therefore, the next step in management should be to evaluate the patient for systemic vasculitis.

The following are the reasons why the other answers are incorrect:

* Answer A: Prescribe prednisone is incorrect because there is no evidence that the patient has systemic vasculitis. Prednisone is a corticosteroid that is used to treat inflammation. However, inflammation is not the only cause of skin lesions. In this case, the skin lesions are most likely due to leukocytoclastic vasculitis, which is a type of vasculitis. Vasculitis is a condition that affects the blood vessels. It can cause inflammation, bleeding, and necrosis of the blood vessels. Prednisone is not a first-line treatment for vasculitis. Other medications, such as cyclophosphamide or azathioprine, are typically used to treat vasculitis.
* Answer C: Prescribe a topical glucocorticoid is incorrect because there is no evidence that the patient has a localized skin condition. Topical glucocorticoids are used to treat inflammation of the skin. However, the patient's skin lesions are most likely due to leukocytoclastic vasculitis, which is a systemic condition. Topical glucocorticoids are not effective in treating systemic conditions.
* Answer D: Provide reassurance and observe patient is incorrect because the patient has a history of chronic hepatitis B infection, which is a risk factor for systemic vasculitis. The patient also has skin lesions that are consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis, which is a type of systemic vasculitis. The patient also has arthralgias, which can be a symptom of systemic vasculitis. A skin biopsy showed findings consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis.

Explanation:
The patient in the case presentation has reticulate hyperpigmentation, hypohidrosis, and sinopulmonary infections. These findings are consistent with X-linked reticulate pigmentary disorder (XLRPD). XLRPD is a rare, inherited disorder characterized by reticulate hyperpigmentation, hypohidrosis, and sinopulmonary infections. The disorder is caused by mutations in the ATP2C1 gene, which encodes a protein involved in the production of sweat. As a result of the mutation, patients with XLRPD have reduced sweat production, which can lead to heat intolerance and hypohidrosis. The reticulate hyperpigmentation is caused by the deposition of melanin in the skin. The sinopulmonary infections are caused by a weakened immune system. There is no cure for XLRPD, but treatment can help to manage the symptoms. Treatment may include medications to reduce sweating, antibiotics to treat infections, and lifestyle changes to stay cool.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Dermatopathia pigmentosa reticularis is a rare, acquired disorder characterized by reticulate hyperpigmentation on the trunk and extremities. The disorder is not associated with hypohidrosis or sinopulmonary infections.
* Dowling-Degos disease is a rare, acquired disorder characterized by reticulate hyperpigmentation on the face, neck, and upper extremities. The disorder is not associated with hypohidrosis or sinopulmonary infections.
* Dyskeratosis congenita is a rare, inherited disorder characterized by nail dystrophy, leukoplakia, and oral leukoplakia. The disorder is not associated with reticulate hyperpigmentation, hypohidrosis, or sinopulmonary infections.

 57%|█████▋    | 867/1525 [3:17:50<2:25:59, 13.31s/it]The answer is: A. Lichen planus pigmentosus.

Lichen planus pigmentosus is a chronic skin disorder characterized by the appearance of hyperpigmented macules and patches on the skin. It is most commonly seen in women of middle age or older, but it can occur in people of any age. The cause of lichen planus pigmentosus is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder.

The lesions of lichen planus pigmentosus are typically small, round, and flat. They may be brown, tan, or black in color. The lesions often occur on the lower legs, but they can also occur on the arms, trunk, and face. Lichen planus pigmentosus is usually a chronic condition, meaning that it can last for many years. However, the lesions often fade over time.

There is no cure for lichen planus pigmentosus, but there are treatments that can help to improve the appearance of the lesions. Treatment may include topical corticosteroids, oral medications, or light therapy.

In the case of the woman in the question, the diagnosis of lichen planus pigmentosus is supported by the following findings:

* The presence of asymptomatic, hyperpigmented macules distributed over the lower extremities.
* The absence of any history of trauma or prior lesions at these sites.
* The absence of fever, arthralgias, myalgias, or constitutional symptoms.
* The absence of any significant past medical history.
* The absence of any medications or supplements.
* The findings on physical examination.
* The findings on skin biopsy.

The diagnosis of leukocytoclastic vasculitis is less likely in this case because the woman does not have any of the characteristic symptoms of leukocytoclastic vasculitis, such as fever, arthralgias, myalgias, or constitutional symptoms. Additionally, the findings on physical examination and skin biopsy are not consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis.

The diagnosis of macular lymphocytic arteritis is also less likely in this case because the woman does not have any of the characteristic symptoms of macular lymphocytic arteritis, such as fever, arthralgias, myalgias, or constitutional symptoms. Additionally, the findings on physical examination and skin biopsy are not consistent with macular lymphocytic arteritis.

The diagnosis of erythema dyschromicum perstans is also less likely in this case because the woman does not have any of the characteristic symptoms of erythema dyschromicum perstans, such as fever, arthralgias, myalgias, or constitutional symptoms. Additionally, the findings on physical examination and skin biopsy are not consistent with erythema dyschromicum perstans.

Explanation:
The patient in this case presented with numerous grouped yellow-brown and red-brown papules on the upper eyelids, infraorbital rims, bilateral axillae, inframammary creases, lower back, buttocks, hips, inguinal folds, and proximal thighs. The lesions first appeared in her right axilla 6 months prior and were asymptomatic. The patient also noted a 3-month history of polyuria, polydipsia, and nocturia. Review of symptoms was otherwise negative. She had no notable medical or family history. On physical examination there were no other sites of involvement including mucosal surfaces. Shave biopsies were obtained from the right and left axillae and sent for histopathological examination.

The histopathology of the shave biopsies showed sheets of foamy histiocytes with Touton giant cells. This is consistent with the diagnosis of xanthoma disseminatum. Xanthogranuloma is a non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis characterized by the proliferation of histiocytes in the skin and other organs. Erdheim-Chester disease is a rare, non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis characterized by the proliferation of histiocytes in the skin, bones, and other organs. Generalized eruptive histiocytoma is a rare, benign, self-limited eruption of histiocytes in the skin.

The patient in this case has the typical clinical presentation of xanthoma disseminatum. The histopathology of the shave biopsies shows the characteristic features of xanthoma disseminatum. The patient does not have any of the features that are characteristic of Erdheim-Chester disease or generalized eruptive histiocytoma. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is xanthoma disseminatum.

Explanation:

Childhood bullous pemphigoid is a rare autoimmune blistering disease that typically affects children under the age of 10. It is characterized by the development of tense blisters on the hands, feet, and other acral areas. The blisters are usually preceded by the development of itchy papules or vesicles.

The diagnosis of childhood bullous pemphigoid is based on the clinical presentation and the results of a skin biopsy. The biopsy typically shows the presence of subepidermal blisters with a positive direct immunofluorescence for IgG and C3.

Treatment of childhood bullous pemphigoid is with systemic corticosteroids. In severe cases, other immunosuppressive agents may be necessary. The prognosis for childhood bullous pemphigoid is generally good, with most patients experiencing complete remission after treatment.

The other options are incorrect because they do not typically present with blisters on the hands and feet. Dyshidrotic eczema is a common skin condition that is characterized by the development of small, itchy blisters on the palms and soles. Bullous tinea is a fungal infection of the skin that can cause blisters, but these blisters are typically located on the trunk and extremities. Distal blistering dactylitis is a rare condition that is characterized by the development of blisters on the fingertips and toes.

Explanation:

A mucocele of the appendix is a cystic mass that forms in the appendix, a small, finger-shaped organ that projects from the colon. Mucoceles are usually caused by a blockage of the appendix's opening, which can lead to the accumulation of mucus.

Mucoceles are most common in people between the ages of 30 and 50, and they are more common in women than in men. The exact cause of mucoceles is unknown, but they are thought to be caused by a combination of factors, including infection, inflammation, and blockage of the appendix's opening.

Most mucoceles are small and do not cause any symptoms. However, larger mucoceles can cause abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. In rare cases, mucoceles can rupture, causing infection and peritonitis, a serious infection of the lining of the abdomen.

Treatment of mucoceles depends on the size and symptoms of the mass. Small, asymptomatic mucoceles may be monitored without treatment. However, larger mucoceles or those that cause symptoms may need to be surgically removed.

The CT scan shows a large, cystic mass in the right iliac fossa. This is consistent with a mucocele of the appendix. The other options are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms or the findings on the CT scan.

Appendix abscess: An appendix abscess is a collection of pus that forms in the appendix. It is usually caused by a bacterial infection. Appendix abscesses are typically treated with antibiotics and surgery to remove the appendix.

Cecal carcinoma: Cecal carcinoma is a type of cancer that starts in the cecum, the first part of the large intestine. Cecal carcinomas are typically diagnosed in people over the age of 50. The most common symptom of cecal carcinoma is abdominal pain. Other symptoms may include weight loss, nausea, vomiting, and blood in the stool. Cecal carcinomas are treated with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.

Neuroendocrine tumor: A neuroendocrine tumor is a type of cancer that starts in the cells that produce hormones. Neuroendocrine tumors can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the lungs, pancreas, and stomach. Neuroendocrine tumors are typically diagnosed in people over the age of 50. The most common symptom of neuroendocrine tumors is abdominal pain. Other symptoms may include weight loss, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Neuroendocrine tumors are treated with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.

Explanation:

The patient is a man in his 70s with a history of pancreatic adenocarcinoma who had undergone a Whipple procedure 2 years prior to presentation. He came to the emergency department with a 1-day history of waxing and waning sharp abdominal pain radiating to his back. He admitted to nausea but no vomiting, fevers, or chills. He reported having normal bowel movements and passing flatus without difficulty. On examination, he was afebrile and not tachycardic. He had a well-healed abdominal midline wound. His abdomen was soft, not distended, and mildly tender diffusely, worse in the epigastrium, without rebound, guarding, or any palpable masses. His bloodwork revealed an elevated lipase level of 2842 U/L (to convert to microkatals per liter, multiply by 0.0167) without leukocytosis or any electrolyte abnormalities. Liver function test results were within normal limits. Given a history of pancreaticoduodenectomy, the patient underwent computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis with oral and intravenous contrast for further evaluation.

The CT scan showed a dilated stomach with an air fluid level and a tubular solid structure within the body of the stomach. This is consistent with afferent loop syndrome, a complication of pancreaticoduodenectomy that occurs when the afferent loop, which is the portion of the jejunum that is anastomosed to the pancreatic remnant, becomes obstructed. This can lead to gastric distention, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain.

Tumor recurrence is a less likely diagnosis in this case given the patient's history and the absence of other signs or symptoms of malignancy. Marginal ulcers are ulcers that occur at the anastomotic site of a pancreaticoduodenectomy. They are typically seen within the first few months after surgery and are usually caused by ischemia or bile reflux. The patient in this case did not have any history of marginal ulcers and the CT scan did not show any evidence of anastomotic dehiscence or infection. Internal hernia is another rare complication of pancreaticoduodenectomy that can occur when a loop of bowel becomes herniated through a defect in the abdominal wall. This can lead to obstruction, ischemia, and necrosis of the bowel. The patient in this case did not have any history of internal hernia and the CT scan did not show any evidence of a hernia.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is afferent loop syndrome.

A biopsy is the removal of a small piece of tissue for examination under a microscope. It is the most reliable way to diagnose a conjunctival lesion. The other options are not as reliable. Time-domain anterior segment optical coherence tomography (TD-AS-OCT) is a non-invasive imaging technique that can be used to assess the structure of the anterior segment of the eye. It can be helpful in diagnosing certain conditions, such as glaucoma, but it is not as reliable as a biopsy for diagnosing a conjunctival lesion. Observing the patient is not a reliable way to diagnose a conjunctival lesion. The lesion may change over time, and it may be difficult to determine whether it is benign or malignant without a biopsy. Obtaining a culture of the lesion may be helpful in identifying the organism that is causing the lesion, but it will not provide information about the nature of the lesion.

In this case, the patient has a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and has received allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. He also has a history of herpes simplex keratitis with fungal infection in the right eye that led to corneal perforation requiring penetrating keratoplasty. These factors increase the patient's risk of developing a conjunctival lesion that is malignant. Therefore, it is important to perform a biopsy of the lesion to rule out malignancy.

The patient in the case has a well-circumscribed, round, solid, and minimally enhancing soft tissue mass in the superotemporal left orbit with an adjacent bone excavation and no calcifications. This is consistent with a diagnosis of a benign mixed tumor, also known as a pleomorphic adenoma. Benign mixed tumors are the most common type of orbital tumor, accounting for up to 50% of all orbital tumors. They are typically slow-growing and non-cancerous, but they can cause symptoms such as proptosis, diplopia, and vision loss.

The treatment of choice for a benign mixed tumor is excisional biopsy. This involves removing the entire tumor, which can be done through a small incision in the eyelid. Excisional biopsy is the most effective way to ensure that the tumor is completely removed and to prevent recurrence.

The other options are not appropriate for this patient. Option A, observing the patient, is not appropriate because the patient has a mass that is causing symptoms. Option B, starting administering steroids and/or antibiotics, is not appropriate because the patient does not have an infection. Option C, fine-needle aspiration biopsy, is not appropriate because it is not a reliable way to diagnose a benign mixed tumor. Fine-needle aspiration biopsy can only provide information about the cells that are present in the sample, but it cannot provide information about the architecture of the tumor. This is important because the architecture of the tumor can help to determine the type of tumor and the best treatment option.

Therefore, the answer is D. Excisional biopsy.

The patient in the case has a clinical presentation consistent with acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (APMPPE), a rare, idiopathic inflammatory disorder of the outer retina and retinal pigment epithelium. APMPPE is typically self-limiting, with most patients experiencing improvement in vision within 3 to 6 months. However, some patients may experience persistent visual loss.

There is no one-size-fits-all treatment for APMPPE. Some clinicians recommend oral corticosteroids, while others advocate for observation alone. Oral corticosteroids may be beneficial in patients with severe visual loss or those who do not improve with observation. However, corticosteroids can also have serious side effects, such as increased risk of infection, osteoporosis, and cataracts.

The decision of whether or not to treat a patient with APMPPE with oral corticosteroids should be made on a case-by-case basis, after careful consideration of the risks and benefits. In the case presented, the patient's best-corrected visual acuities are 20/40 OD and 20/25 OS. This suggests that he has not experienced significant visual loss. Additionally, he does not have any systemic symptoms, such as eye redness, pain, or photophobia. These findings suggest that the patient may be a good candidate for observation alone. However, the decision of whether or not to treat should be made in consultation with an ophthalmologist.

A: Recommend multivitamin supplementation is incorrect. Multivitamin supplementation is not a treatment for APMPPE.

B: Give an intravitreal anti-VEGF injection is incorrect. Intravitreal anti-VEGF injections are not indicated for the treatment of APMPPE.

D: Insist on observation for spontaneous resolution is incorrect. Observation alone may be appropriate for some patients with APMPPE, but it is not always the best option. The decision of whether or not to treat should be made on a case-by-case basis, after careful consideration of the risks and benefits.

The patient is in wide complex tachycardia, which is a life-threatening condition. The first step in management is to cardiovert the patient to sinus rhythm. This can be done with direct current cardioversion, which is the most effective way to convert wide complex tachycardia. After cardioversion, the patient should be evaluated for the underlying cause of the tachycardia, which is most likely coronary artery disease. The patient should have coronary angiography to assess the extent of her coronary artery disease and to determine if she is a candidate for revascularization.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* B) Give amiodarone for treatment of ventricular tachycardia: Amiodarone is a class III antiarrhythmic drug that can be used to treat ventricular tachycardia. However, it is not the first-line treatment for this condition. Direct current cardioversion is the most effective way to convert wide complex tachycardia.
* C) Give procainamide for treatment of preexcited atrial fibrillation: Procainamide is a class IA antiarrhythmic drug that can be used to treat preexcited atrial fibrillation. However, it is not the first-line treatment for this condition. Direct current cardioversion is the most effective way to convert wide complex tachycardia.
* D) Give adenosine for treatment of supraventricular tachycardia: Adenosine is a class III antiarrhythmic drug that can be used to treat supraventricular tachycardia. However, it is not the first-line treatment for wide complex tachycardia. Direct current cardioversion is the most effective way to convert wide complex tachycardia.

Explanation:

The patient has hypercalciuria due to idiopathic hypercalciuria. This is the most common cause of hypercalciuria in adults. It is characterized by increased urinary calcium excretion in the absence of an obvious cause, such as hyperparathyroidism, primary hyperaldosteronism, or vitamin D intoxication. The exact cause of idiopathic hypercalciuria is unknown, but it may be due to a defect in the renal tubular reabsorption of calcium.

The patient in this case has a history of recurrent nephrolithiasis, which is a risk factor for idiopathic hypercalciuria. He also has a normal serum calcium level, which suggests that his hypercalciuria is not due to primary hyperparathyroidism. His urine calcium excretion is also elevated, which is a characteristic finding in idiopathic hypercalciuria.

The other options are incorrect. Option A is incorrect because the patient does not have distal renal tubular acidosis. This is a rare disorder that is characterized by impaired renal tubular reabsorption of bicarbonate. Patients with distal renal tubular acidosis have a low serum bicarbonate level and an elevated urinary bicarbonate level. Option B is incorrect because the patient does not have a high animal protein intake. Animal protein intake can increase urinary calcium excretion, but this is not the case in this patient. Option C is incorrect because the patient does not have a high salt intake. Salt intake can also increase urinary calcium excretion, but this is not the case in this patient.

IMT is a rare, benign mesenchymal tumor that occurs most commonly in children and young adults. It typically presents as a rapidly growing mass in the head and neck region. The tumor is composed of spindle cells with a storiform pattern and a moderate lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate. IMT is positive for CD68 and factor XIIIa, and negative for smooth muscle actin, desmin, cytokeratin, and CD34.

The other options are incorrect because:

* Nodular fasciitis is a benign, reactive lesion that typically presents as a small, painless mass. It is composed of myofibroblasts in a haphazard arrangement. Nodular fasciitis is positive for vimentin and negative for CD68 and factor XIIIa.
* Spindle cell carcinoma is a rare, aggressive form of cancer that can arise from a variety of tissues. It is composed of spindle cells with a high mitotic rate and nuclear atypia. Spindle cell carcinoma is positive for vimentin, desmin, and CD34, and negative for CD68 and factor XIIIa.
* Rhabdomyosarcoma is a malignant tumor of skeletal muscle. It typically presents as a rapidly growing mass in the head and neck region. The tumor is composed of rhabdomyoblasts, which are cells with a striated appearance. Rhabdomyosarcoma is positive for desmin, myogenin, and actin, and negative for vimentin and CD68.

Plasmablastic lymphoma is a rare, aggressive B-cell lymphoma that typically occurs in older adults. It is characterized by the presence of plasmablasts, which are a type of B-cell that produces antibodies. Plasmablastic lymphoma often presents with lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes), fever, and weight loss. It can also involve other organs, such as the skin, bones, and gastrointestinal tract.

The diagnosis of plasmablastic lymphoma is based on a biopsy of involved tissue. The biopsy will show a proliferation of plasmablasts. Immunohistochemical staining will show that the plasmablasts express CD138 and EBV-EBER.

The treatment of plasmablastic lymphoma is typically with chemotherapy. Radiation therapy may also be used in some cases. The prognosis for plasmablastic lymphoma is poor, with a median survival of only 12-18 months.

The other options are incorrect because they are not associated with the clinical presentation and findings in this case. Burkitt lymphoma is a rare, aggressive B-cell lymphoma that typically occurs in children and young adults. It is characterized by the presence of large, Burkitt cells, which are a type of B-cell that produces large amounts of the antibody IgM. Burkitt lymphoma often presents with lymphadenopathy, fever, and weight loss. It can also involve other organs, such as the bone marrow, central nervous system, and gastrointestinal tract.

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is a common type of B-cell lymphoma that can occur at any age. It is characterized by the presence of large, diffusely infiltrating B-cells. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma often presents with lymphadenopathy, fever, and weight loss. It can also involve other organs, such as the bone marrow, liver, and spleen.

Kaposi sarcoma is a rare, vascular neoplasm that is associated with human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8). It typically occurs in older adults, especially those with HIV/AIDS. Kaposi sarcoma often presents with skin lesions, but it can also involve other organs, such as the lymph nodes, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract.

Explanation:
The most likely diagnosis is ectopic hamartomatous thymoma. This is a rare tumor that typically occurs in the anterior mediastinum, but can also occur in the neck. It is composed of a mixture of mature thymic epithelial cells, adipose tissue, and skeletal muscle. The tumor is usually benign, but can rarely be malignant.

The patient in this case is a man in his 70s with a 6-year history of a painless lump in his left supraclavicular region. The mass is smooth, soft, and fluctuant, and is located near the sternocleidomastoid muscle. There is no continuity between the tumor and the thyroid gland. Imaging studies show a poorly circumscribed, heterogeneous, and cystic mass. Fine-needle aspiration cytology reveals cystic elements but no atypical cells. Positron emission tomography shows hypermetabolism in the mass.

The combination of these findings is most consistent with a diagnosis of ectopic hamartomatous thymoma. The tumor is typically slow-growing and asymptomatic, but can occasionally cause compression of surrounding structures. Treatment is usually surgical resection, with good long-term outcomes.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely. Synovial sarcoma is a rare malignant tumor that typically occurs in the extremities. It is not typically seen in the neck. Cervical neurilemmoma is a benign tumor that arises from the Schwann cells of the peripheral nerves. It is typically located in the neck, but can also occur in the extremities. Pleomorphic adenoma is a benign tumor that arises from the salivary glands. It is typically located in the parotid gland, but can also occur in the submandibular gland.

Explanation:
The patient is an elderly man with a history of right-sided nasal congestion and epistaxis. He has no history of nasal trauma or surgery. The CT scan shows opacification of the right nasal cavity with tissue protruding into the nasopharynx and complete opacification of the right maxillary, anterior ethmoid, and frontal sinuses. The biopsy shows sheets of atypical, pleomorphic epithelioid cells, some with prominent pigment. The immunohistochemical stains are positive for HMB-45 and S-100.

These findings are most consistent with sinonasal mucosal melanoma. Sinonasal mucosal melanoma is a rare malignancy that accounts for <1% of all melanomas. It is most common in elderly men with a history of chronic nasal obstruction or epistaxis. The CT scan findings are typical of sinonasal mucosal melanoma, and the biopsy findings are diagnostic.

The treatment for sinonasal mucosal melanoma is surgical resection with adjuvant radiation therapy. The prognosis is poor, with a 5-year survival rate of <20%.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely in this case. Leiomyosarcoma is a soft tissue sarcoma that is most common in the extremities. Olfactory neuroblastoma is a rare neuroendocrine tumor that is most common in children. Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma is a high-grade malignancy that is most common in elderly men.

 58%|█████▊    | 882/1525 [3:21:22<2:38:44, 14.81s/it]Answer: C. Perform a bone marrow biopsy.

Explanation: The patient's presentation is concerning for acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). APL is characterized by a high white blood cell count with a predominance of blasts, as well as a characteristic appearance on peripheral blood smear. The patient's laboratory evaluation shows a white blood cell count of 2.4 × 103/µL, with 54% blasts. This is consistent with the diagnosis of APL.

The next step in the management of this patient is to perform a bone marrow biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and to assess the extent of the disease. The bone marrow biopsy will also help to determine the patient's prognosis and to guide treatment.

Cytarabine and daunorubicin are chemotherapy drugs that are used to treat APL. However, they should not be started before the bone marrow biopsy is performed. This is because these drugs can cause a life-threatening condition called tumor lysis syndrome in patients with high white blood cell counts.

A central venous catheter is a device that is inserted into a vein in the chest or neck. It is used to deliver fluids, medications, and blood products. It is also used to obtain blood samples. However, there is no indication that the patient needs a central venous catheter at this time.

Therefore, the next step in the management of this patient is to perform a bone marrow biopsy.

Explanation:

The patient in this case presents with a history of chronic paroxysmal palpitations, flushing, a pale complexion, and diaphoresis. These symptoms are consistent with pheochromocytoma, a rare catecholamine-secreting tumor of the adrenal medulla. Pheochromocytomas are often associated with hypertension, but can also present with other symptoms such as palpitations, sweating, and flushing.

The laboratory tests in this case show elevated urinary metanephrines and normetanephrines, which are metabolites of catecholamines. These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to obtain imaging studies of the adrenal glands to look for a pheochromocytoma. If a pheochromocytoma is found, it can be treated with surgery or medication.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms in a consistent manner. Adrenocortical carcinoma is a rare cancer of the adrenal cortex that can cause symptoms such as weight loss, hypertension, and virilization. Aldosterone-producing adenoma is a benign tumor of the adrenal gland that can cause symptoms such as hypertension, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. False-positive results on metanephrine testing can occur in patients with certain medications, such as tricyclic antidepressants and amphetamines.

 58%|█████▊    | 884/1525 [3:21:49<2:29:19, 13.98s/it]The correct answer is C: Refer to an oral surgeon for excision.

The patient is a pregnant woman with a soft-tissue mass on her upper maxillary gingiva. The mass is not painful but bleeds when she brushes her teeth or eats sharp foods, which makes it difficult to eat. There is no discharge from the area. She has no fevers, no trauma to the area, and no history of a similar condition.

The most likely diagnosis is a pyogenic granuloma, which is a benign tumor of the gums that is often associated with pregnancy. Pyogenic granulomas are typically treated with excision.

Prescribing a course of prednisone is not the best option in this case because it is a corticosteroid and can have harmful side effects, especially in pregnant women. A needle biopsy is not the best option because it is not a definitive diagnosis and may not be able to differentiate between a pyogenic granuloma and a more serious condition, such as a malignancy. Watchful waiting is not the best option because the mass is causing the patient pain and difficulty eating.

Therefore, the best course of action is to refer the patient to an oral surgeon for excision.

 58%|█████▊    | 885/1525 [3:22:03<2:28:57, 13.97s/it]The correct answer is C. Request a surgical consult for adrenalectomy.

The patient is a 56-year-old woman with a large adrenal tumor that shows marked 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake on PET/CT scan. This finding is highly suggestive of malignancy. The patient has no symptoms or signs of adrenal hyperfunction, and her biochemical evaluation is normal. These findings suggest that the tumor is not functional.

The standard treatment for a large adrenal tumor with marked 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake is surgical resection. This is the only way to definitively diagnose the tumor and to cure the patient of the disease if the tumor is malignant. Adrenalectomy is also the only way to control the symptoms of adrenal hyperfunction if the tumor is functional.

A biopsy of the tumor is not necessary in this case because the PET/CT scan findings are highly suggestive of malignancy. A repeat CT scan in 3-6 months would not be helpful because the tumor is already large and likely malignant. Adrenal magnetic resonance imaging is not necessary because the PET/CT scan is more accurate in diagnosing adrenal tumors.

Therefore, the best course of action is to request a surgical consult for adrenalectomy.

Explanation:
The patient in the case presentation has a number of clinical features that are consistent with septic emboli, including:

* Petechiae and hemorrhagic vesicles, with most concentrated on the hands and feet
* Palpable purpura noted across the extremities
* Several lesions studded with pustules
* An enlarging bulla on his left wrist
* An abrasion on his left elbow attributed to his recent falls
* Concern about endocarditis
* Histopathological examination of a skin biopsy specimen that showed focal ulceration and underlying vascular thrombosis with extramural fibrin deposition

Septic emboli are small pieces of infected material that are carried through the bloodstream and lodge in small blood vessels, causing inflammation and necrosis. They can occur as a complication of a number of different infections, including bacterial endocarditis, pneumonia, and osteomyelitis. The clinical features of septic emboli can vary depending on the site of the emboli and the underlying infection. However, some common features include fever, chills, malaise, and weight loss. The skin lesions that are seen in septic emboli are typically small, red or purple spots that may be raised or flat. They may also be painful or itchy. In some cases, the skin lesions may develop into larger ulcers.

The diagnosis of septic emboli is made based on the patient's clinical history and physical examination findings. Imaging studies, such as a chest X-ray or CT scan, may be helpful in identifying the source of the infection. Blood cultures may also be helpful in identifying the organism that is causing the infection.

The treatment of septic emboli is aimed at treating the underlying infection and preventing further emboli. This may include antibiotics, surgery, or other procedures. The prognosis for patients with septic emboli is variable, depending on the underlying infection and the extent of the damage that has been caused. However, with prompt diagnosis and treatment, most patients make a good recovery.

The other possible diagnoses are not as likely as septic emboli in this case. Rat bite fever is a bacterial infection that is caused by the bite of an infected rat. The clinical features of rat bite fever include fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, and a rash. Rocky mountain spotted fever is a bacterial infection that is caused by the bite of an infected tick. The clinical features of Rocky mountain spotted fever include fever, headache, rash, and muscle aches. Disseminated gonococcemia is a bacterial infection that is caused by the bacterium Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The clinical features of disseminated gonococcemia include fever, chills, headache, rash, and arthritis.

Explanation:

The patient is a man in his 30s who presented with a mass in the right nostril that had been growing for about 1 year. The lesion bled with minimal trauma but did not obstruct his breathing. The patient did not smoke and denied any medical history of chronic rhinosinusitis. Physical examination revealed a 1-cm, nontender, exophytic, verrucous, skin-colored plaque on the right nasal vestibule. A diagnostic shave biopsy specimen was taken after informed consent was obtained.

The histologic sections show papillary fronds with slender fibrovascular cores that are lined by nonkeratinizing squamous epithelium. Higher magnification shows mucin-containing goblet cells. Neither cytologic atypia nor atypical mitotic figures are present.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of exophytic Schneiderian papilloma. Schneiderian papillomas are benign tumors that arise from the Schneiderian membrane, which lines the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. They are the most common type of nasal tumor, accounting for approximately 70% of all nasal neoplasms.

Exophytic Schneiderian papillomas are typically solitary lesions that occur in the middle meatus of the nasal cavity. They are most common in adults aged 20-40 years, and there is a slight male predominance.

The most common symptom of an exophytic Schneiderian papilloma is a nasal obstruction. Other symptoms may include epistaxis, postnasal drainage, and facial pain.

The diagnosis of an exophytic Schneiderian papilloma is made based on the clinical presentation and the results of a biopsy. The treatment of choice is surgical excision. The prognosis for patients with exophytic Schneiderian papillomas is excellent. The vast majority of patients are cured with surgery.

A papillary/exophytic squamous cell carcinoma is a malignant tumor that arises from the squamous epithelium of the nasal cavity. It is the most common type of malignant tumor of the nasal cavity.

Verruca vulgaris is a common viral infection that causes warts. Warts are typically small, raised lesions that can occur on the skin, mucous membranes, or genitals.

Rhinoscleroma is a chronic granulomatous disease that is caused by the bacterium Klebsiella rhinoscleromatis. It is most common in Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.

Explanation:

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with sporotrichosis, a fungal infection caused by the fungus Sporothrix schenckii. The infection is usually acquired through contact with contaminated soil or wood, and it most commonly manifests as a cutaneous infection. The cutaneous form of sporotrichosis typically presents as a single, painless, erythematous papule that develops at the site of inoculation. The papule then enlarges and develops into a nodule or plaque, which may ulcerate and discharge a purulent exudate. In some cases, the infection may spread to the lymph nodes, causing lymphadenopathy.

The diagnosis of sporotrichosis is made based on the patient's history and physical examination, as well as laboratory testing. Potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation of skin scrapings may reveal the presence of fungal spores. Histopathologic examination of skin biopsy specimens may also show the presence of fungal spores. Definitive diagnosis is made by culture of the fungus from skin or lymph node tissue.

Treatment of sporotrichosis is with antifungal medications, such as itraconazole or fluconazole. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove infected tissue. The prognosis for sporotrichosis is generally good with treatment. However, the infection can be chronic and relapsing, and it may require lifelong treatment.

The other possible diagnoses are not consistent with the patient's history and physical examination. Bacterial folliculitis is a common skin infection caused by bacteria that live on the skin. It typically presents as a cluster of small, red, tender papules or pustules that develop around hair follicles. Cellulitis is a bacterial infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue. It typically presents as a red, swollen, and tender area of skin that is warm to the touch. Mycobacterium marinum is a bacterium that can cause skin infections in people who have been exposed to contaminated water. It typically presents as a single, red, papule or nodule that develops at the site of exposure. Majocchi granuloma is a fungal infection of the hair follicles. It typically presents as a single, red, papule or nodule that develops on the scalp.

Explanation:

The most likely diagnosis in this case is pustular psoriasis. This is supported by the following clinical findings:

* The patient is a young boy with a history of atopic dermatitis. Atopic dermatitis is a common skin condition that is often associated with psoriasis.
* The patient presented with a 2-day history of high fever and rash. Pustular psoriasis is a type of psoriasis that is characterized by the sudden onset of fever and a rash of pustules.
* The rash is symmetrical and involves the inguinal folds, antecubital fossae, and popliteal fossae. These are typical locations for pustular psoriasis.
* The laboratory findings are consistent with pustular psoriasis. There is leukocytosis with neutrophilia, which is a common finding in pustular psoriasis.
* The biopsy findings are consistent with pustular psoriasis. The biopsy shows a subcorneal pustule with underlying neutrophilic spongiosis, with associated psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia and rare individually necrotic keratinocytes. This is a classic finding in pustular psoriasis.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely. Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP) is a rare, self-limited disorder that typically occurs in adults. It is characterized by the sudden onset of fever and a generalized rash of pustules. However, AGEP does not typically involve the inguinal folds, antecubital fossae, and popliteal fossae. Deficiency of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) is a rare genetic disorder that can present with pustular psoriasis. However, the patient in this case does not have a family history of psoriasis. Staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome is a bacterial infection that typically occurs in children. It is characterized by the sudden onset of fever and a rash of large, flaccid bullae. The bullae in staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome are not typically associated with pustules.

Explanation:

The patient is a 43-year-old woman with a history of hypertension, morbid obesity, fibromyalgia, and obstructive sleep apnea dependent on positive pressure ventilation. She underwent a tonsillectomy at age 5 years. She smoked for 1 year but quit 20 years before this presentation. There is no family history of malignancy.

The patient presented to the emergency department with substernal chest pain and dyspnea. After ruling out acute coronary syndrome or pulmonary embolus, a computed tomography scan of her thorax revealed lytic lesions of the sternum and second rib and a large mass involving the right scapula. On further inquiry, the patient acknowledged right shoulder pain that had been progressing over 5 months and leading to a limited mobility of the right upper extremity.

The patient's comorbidities include hypertension, morbid obesity, fibromyalgia, and obstructive sleep apnea dependent on positive pressure ventilation. Hypertension is a risk factor for metastatic bone disease. Morbid obesity is a risk factor for multiple myeloma, which can present with lytic bone lesions. Fibromyalgia is a chronic pain syndrome that is not associated with lytic bone lesions. Obstructive sleep apnea is a sleep disorder that is not associated with lytic bone lesions.

The patient's history of tonsillectomy is not relevant to the diagnosis of metastatic bone disease.

The patient's smoking history is relevant to the diagnosis of metastatic bone disease. Smoking is a risk factor for multiple myeloma, which can present with lytic bone lesions.

The patient's family history of malignancy is not relevant to the diagnosis of metastatic bone disease.

On examination, the patient was morbidly obese with a body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 63. There was fullness involving the right scapula. She could not abduct her right arm.

The patient's obesity is a risk factor for multiple myeloma, which can present with lytic bone lesions. The patient's inability to abduct her right arm is a sign of lytic bone lesions.

Laboratory testing included comprehensive metabolic panel and complete blood cell count results within the normal range, except for a calcium level of 10.4 mg/dL (for millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.25) (reference range, 8.4-10.2) and alkaline phosphatase level of 400 U/L (for micokatals per liter, multiply by 0.0167) (reference range, 36-126).

The patient's elevated calcium level is a sign of hypercalcemia, which can be caused by metastatic bone disease. The patient's elevated alkaline phosphatase level is a sign of bone destruction, which can be caused by metastatic bone disease.

A computed tomography–guided biopsy of the mass gave a broad differential.

The computed tomography–guided biopsy of the mass was unable to provide a definitive diagnosis.

The patient was referred to our Cancer Center with a diagnosis of a metastatic giant cell tumor.

The diagnosis of a metastatic giant cell tumor is not supported by the patient's history, physical examination, laboratory findings, or imaging studies.

Magnetic resonance imaging of the shoulder was not possible because of weight limitations.

The patient's obesity prevented her from undergoing magnetic resonance imaging of the shoulder.

In conclusion, the patient's most likely diagnosis is metastatic lytic bone lesions of unknown primary.

Explanation: The patient presented with a soft tissue abscess of the index finger 7 days after the initial trauma. This is consistent with a diagnosis of herpetic whitlow, which is a common infection of the finger caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). The virus is typically transmitted through contact with infected saliva or blood. In this case, the surgeon was exposed to HSV when he used a blade to drain an abscess of the oral cavity. The patient then developed prodromal burning pain of the same index finger, and a similar soft tissue abscess recurred after 48 hours at the same site of the original lesion with a small painful vesicle progressively developed. This is also consistent with a diagnosis of herpetic whitlow. The other possible diagnoses are not supported by the patient's history and presentation. A foreign body reaction would not typically cause a soft tissue abscess, and an osteitis is an infection of the bone. A bacterial cellulitis is a bacterial infection of the skin and soft tissues, but it would not typically recur in the same location.

Explanation:

The patient presented with a 4-week history of bilateral decreased vision. Her medical history was remarkable for type 2 diabetes, which was well-controlled with insulin. A fundus examination revealed bilateral hyperemic discs, macular edema, and subretinal fluid, with numerous flame-shaped hemorrhages in 4 quadrants without microaneurysms, exudates, or neovascularization. There was no evidence of intraocular inflammation. Fluorescein angiography was deferred because of her pregnancy.

The patient's blood tests revealed a decreased protein S level (61%) and factor V Leiden testing results revealed heterozygosity in the R506Q mutation. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), which is a systemic autoimmune disorder that can cause thrombosis in the blood vessels.

The treatment of APS during pregnancy is challenging, as there is a risk of fetal harm from anticoagulation. However, anticoagulation is essential to prevent maternal thrombosis and thromboembolism. Therefore, the best management for this patient is to refer her to a hematology service for further evaluation and treatment.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Option A, performing an intravitreous injection of an antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), is not indicated for APS. VEGF inhibitors are used to treat diabetic retinopathy, but they are not effective in treating APS. Option C, observing the patient, is not appropriate because the patient has a significant risk of developing thrombosis. Option D, performing panretinal photocoagulation in both eyes, is not indicated for APS. Panretinal photocoagulation is used to treat diabetic retinopathy, but it is not effective in treating APS.

Explanation:

Cholesterol granuloma is a benign, non-neoplastic lesion that is characterized by a central cholesterol granuloma and a peripheral rim of fibrosis. It is most commonly found in the middle ear and mastoid, but can also occur in the paranasal sinuses, including the sphenoid sinus. The pathogenesis of cholesterol granuloma is not fully understood, but it is thought to be caused by an obstruction of the sinus ostium, which leads to an accumulation of secretions and cholesterol crystals. Cholesterol granulomas are usually asymptomatic, but can present with symptoms such as headache, facial pain, and hearing loss. Diagnosis is made with imaging studies, such as CT scan or MRI, which show a well-circumscribed, hypodense mass. Treatment is typically surgical excision, which is curative in most cases.

Chondrosarcoma is a malignant tumor of cartilage that most commonly arises in the bones of the extremities. It is a rare tumor, accounting for less than 1% of all bone cancers. Chondrosarcomas can be classified into two types: conventional chondrosarcoma and mesenchymal chondrosarcoma. Conventional chondrosarcoma is the most common type and typically occurs in people in their 30s or 40s. Mesenchymal chondrosarcoma is a more aggressive type that occurs in people in their 20s or 30s. Chondrosarcomas can spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs, liver, and brain. Treatment for chondrosarcoma typically involves surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

Chordomas are rare, malignant tumors that arise from the notochord, a primitive structure that forms the spine. They are most commonly found in the sacrum, but can also occur in the skull base, clivus, and other parts of the spine. Chordomas are slow-growing tumors that can cause local destruction of bone and soft tissues. They can also spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs, liver, and brain. Treatment for chordoma typically involves surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

 59%|█████▊    | 894/1525 [3:24:19<2:41:21, 15.34s/it]Answer: D. Langerhans cell histiocytosis of the temporal bone

Explanation:

The patient is a man in his 70s with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who presents with painless left-sided otorrhea, aural fullness, and hearing loss for nearly 1 year. He had previous complaints of left-sided aural pressure and intermittent clear otorrhea that were unsuccessfully treated at another center with 2 sets of pressure equalization tubes (PETs) and 3 courses of ototopical antibiotics. In the month before presenting to us, the otorrhea had turned bloody. He had not experienced fever, malaise, weight loss, lymphadenopathy, skin lesions, or vertigo.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) of the temporal bone. LCH is a rare, non-cancerous disorder of the immune system that can affect any part of the body, but most commonly affects the bones, skin, and lymph nodes. In the temporal bone, LCH can cause a variety of symptoms, including otorrhea, aural fullness, hearing loss, and facial nerve paralysis.

The patient's CT scan shows near-complete opacification of the left mastoid air cells, which is a characteristic finding of LCH. The biopsy specimen shows homogenous, small basophilic cells, which are also characteristic of LCH. Immunostaining shows that the cells are CD20 positive, which is further evidence of a diagnosis of LCH.

The other possible diagnoses are all less likely in this patient. Skull base osteomyelitis is a bacterial infection of the skull base that is typically associated with fever, malaise, and weight loss. Extramedullary chronic lymphocytic leukemia is a rare condition in which CLL cells spread outside of the bone marrow, but it is not typically associated with otorrhea or hearing loss. Chronic nonsuppurative otitis media is a chronic inflammation of the middle ear that is typically associated with otorrhea and tympanic membrane perforation, but it is not typically associated with hearing loss.

In conclusion, the patient's history, physical examination, CT scan, and biopsy findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis of the temporal bone.

 59%|█████▊    | 895/1525 [3:24:36<2:44:48, 15.70s/it]The answer is **C: Fibrous dysplasia**.

Fibro-osseous lesions are a group of benign bone tumors that are characterized by the replacement of normal bone with fibrous tissue and woven bone. Fibrous dysplasia is the most common type of fibro-osseous lesion, and it typically affects children and young adults. The lesion can occur in any bone, but it is most commonly found in the long bones of the arms and legs.

The cause of fibrous dysplasia is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a mutation in a gene that controls bone growth. The mutation leads to the abnormal growth of fibrous tissue and woven bone, which can cause a variety of symptoms, including pain, swelling, and deformity of the affected bone.

The diagnosis of fibrous dysplasia is based on a physical examination, imaging studies, and a biopsy. Imaging studies, such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRI scans, can help to identify the location and extent of the lesion. A biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out other possible causes of the symptoms.

The treatment of fibrous dysplasia depends on the size and location of the lesion, the severity of the symptoms, and the patient's age. In some cases, no treatment is necessary. In other cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the lesion or to correct any deformities that have occurred. Radiation therapy may also be used to shrink the lesion.

The prognosis for fibrous dysplasia is generally good. Most patients with fibrous dysplasia have a normal life expectancy. However, the lesion can recur, and it can also lead to complications, such as fractures and bone deformity.

The following are the reasons why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Intraosseous meningioma** is a type of brain tumor that starts in the meninges, which are the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. Intraosseous meningiomas are rare, and they typically affect adults. The symptoms of intraosseous meningiomas vary depending on the size and location of the tumor. Common symptoms include headache, seizures, and vision problems. Treatment for intraosseous meningiomas typically involves surgery to remove the tumor.
* **B: Mucocele** is a benign tumor that is caused by the accumulation of mucus in a sinus. Mucoceles are most common in the frontal sinuses, but they can also occur in the maxillary and ethmoid sinuses. The symptoms of a mucocele vary depending on the size and location of the tumor. Common symptoms include headache, facial pain, and nasal congestion. Treatment for a mucocele typically involves surgery to remove the tumor.
* **D: Osteosarcoma** is a type of bone cancer that typically affects adolescents and young adults. Osteosarcoma is the most common type of primary bone cancer in the United States. The symptoms of osteosarcoma vary depending on the location of the tumor. Common symptoms include pain, swelling, and a lump on the affected bone. Treatment for osteosarcoma typically involves surgery to remove the tumor, followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

A parapharyngeal abscess is a collection of pus that forms between the pharynx and the parotid gland. It is a rare but serious infection that can cause airway obstruction, sepsis, and death.

The most common cause of a parapharyngeal abscess is dental infection. Other causes include pharyngitis, tonsillitis, and otitis media.

The symptoms of a parapharyngeal abscess include fever, neck pain, dysphagia, trismus, and odynophagia. On physical examination, there is a bulge in the neck that is tender to palpation.

A CT scan of the neck is the most definitive way to diagnose a parapharyngeal abscess. It shows a well-defined, hypodense mass in the parapharyngeal space.

The treatment of a parapharyngeal abscess is surgical drainage. The abscess is drained through an incision in the neck. Antibiotics are also given to treat the infection.

The prognosis for patients with parapharyngeal abscess is good with prompt diagnosis and treatment. However, if the abscess is not treated, it can spread to the mediastinum and cause life-threatening complications.

The other options are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms and findings.

* A pseudoaneurysm is a bulge in an artery that is caused by a weakening of the artery wall. It is not typically associated with fever, neck pain, dysphagia, trismus, or odynophagia.
* A paraganglioma is a tumor that arises from the paraganglia, which are small clusters of cells that produce hormones. It is not typically associated with fever, neck pain, dysphagia, trismus, or odynophagia.
* A venolymphatic malformation is a congenital disorder of the lymphatic system. It is not typically associated with fever, neck pain, dysphagia, trismus, or odynophagia.

The patient in this case presents with acute and painless monocular vision loss in his right eye. He has a history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and his medical examination reveals bilateral lower leg swelling, a rash of the torso, painful “bumps” on his neck, reduced hearing abilities, and tinnitus. These findings are concerning for a systemic infection, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis.

CMV retinitis is a common opportunistic infection in patients with HIV. It is caused by the reactivation of a latent CMV infection in the retina. The most common presentation of CMV retinitis is unilateral vision loss. Other symptoms may include floaters, flashing lights, and pain.

The diagnosis of CMV retinitis is made based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. Serologic testing for CMV is often used to screen for the infection in patients with HIV. A positive serology test indicates that the patient has been exposed to CMV, but it does not necessarily mean that the patient has active CMV infection.

Other tests that may be used to diagnose CMV retinitis include an ophthalmologic examination, which can reveal characteristic retinal lesions, and an optical coherence tomography (OCT) scan, which can provide more detailed information about the retinal lesions.

Treatment for CMV retinitis typically involves the use of antiviral medications, such as ganciclovir or foscarnet. These medications can be administered intravenously, orally, or intravitreally (directly into the eye). The goal of treatment is to halt the progression of the infection and prevent further vision loss.

In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the damaged retina. This is usually only done if the infection has progressed to the point where it is causing severe vision loss.

The prognosis for patients with CMV retinitis is generally good with early diagnosis and treatment. However, if the infection is not treated, it can lead to permanent vision loss.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* **A: Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain** is not indicated in this case. The patient's symptoms are not suggestive of a brain tumor or other intracranial lesion.
* **B: Systemic antimicrobial treatment** is not indicated in this case. The patient's symptoms are not suggestive of a systemic bacterial infection.
* **D: Chorioretinal biopsy** is not indicated in this case. The patient's symptoms are not suggestive of a malignancy.

Explanation:

The patient in the case presented with acute-onset bilateral decreased vision. The history of altered mental status and the presence of peripapillary retinal whitening emanating from the optic nerve and encroaching into the macula, more pronounced in the right eye, are concerning for cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis. CMV retinitis is a common opportunistic infection in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). It is usually diagnosed by ophthalmologic examination, with confirmation by fluorescein angiography. The treatment of CMV retinitis is with intravenous ganciclovir.

The patient has a history of cutaneous melanoma, and the current presentation is concerning for metastatic disease to the eye. Radiation therapy is the most common treatment for metastatic melanoma to the eye, and plaque brachytherapy or proton beam therapy are the most effective modalities. Transvitreal biopsy is not indicated in this case, as it would not provide any additional information that would change the management of the patient. Iridocyclectomy is a surgical procedure that may be used to treat primary iris melanoma, but it is not indicated for metastatic melanoma. Enucleation with orbital implant is a radical procedure that is reserved for cases of metastatic melanoma that are not responsive to radiation therapy.

Plaque brachytherapy is a type of radiation therapy in which a radioactive source is placed directly on the tumor. Proton beam therapy is a type of radiation therapy that uses high-energy protons to destroy cancer cells. Both plaque brachytherapy and proton beam therapy are effective treatments for metastatic melanoma to the eye.

In this case, the patient has a history of cutaneous melanoma and a current presentation that is concerning for metastatic disease to the eye.

The patient in the case has a 44-base pair (bp) internal tandem duplication in the FLT3 gene. This type of mutation is associated with a worse prognosis in AML. However, the exact impact of this mutation on the patient's prognosis cannot be determined without further testing. Gene sequencing would allow for identification of the exact mutation and its location in the FLT3 gene. This information would be helpful in predicting the patient's response to treatment and estimating his overall prognosis.

Answer A is incorrect because the patient's prognosis cannot be determined without further testing. Answer B is incorrect because the length of the duplication is not the only factor that affects prognosis. Answer C is incorrect because the patient's prognosis is likely to be affected by the FLT3 mutation, even though the mutation burden is low.

The patient has a nonblanchable purpuric rash, which is a characteristic finding of Henoch-Schönlein purpura (HSP). HSP is a small vessel vasculitis that typically affects children, but can also occur in adults. The most common symptoms are abdominal pain, joint pain, and a rash. The rash is typically purpuric (purple) and nonblanchable, and it often occurs on the lower extremities and buttocks.

The diagnosis of HSP is made based on the clinical presentation and the results of a skin biopsy. The skin biopsy shows leukocytoclastic vasculitis, which is inflammation of small blood vessels with infiltration of white blood cells. DIF is a specialized test that can be used to detect immunoglobulin and complement deposition in the skin. DIF is positive in the majority of cases of HSP.

The treatment of HSP is typically supportive. Steroids may be used to reduce inflammation, and colchicine may be used to prevent joint complications. In severe cases, plasmapheresis may be necessary.

The other options are not correct because:

* A: Check serologies for hepatitis, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), parvovirus, and streptococcal infections. These tests are not necessary in the diagnosis of HSP.
* B: Check antinuclear antibody (ANA). ANA is a test that can be used to detect the presence of autoantibodies. ANA is not specific for HSP, and it is not necessary in the diagnosis of this condition.
* D: Prescribe steroids with a slow and prolonged tapering regimen. Steroids may be used to treat HSP, but they are not always necessary. In mild cases, steroids may not be necessary.

Explanation: The patient has a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) because she has a JAK2 V617F mutation. JAK2 is a protein that is involved in the production of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The JAK2 V617F mutation causes JAK2 to become overactive, which can lead to the production of too many red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. This can increase the risk of blood clots, such as the hepatic vein thrombosis that the patient developed.

Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is a rare blood disorder that causes the destruction of red blood cells. It is not caused by a JAK2 mutation. Hereditary protein C deficiency and hereditary antithrombin III deficiency are rare blood disorders that cause the blood to clot too easily. They are also not caused by a JAK2 mutation.

Vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS) is a rare, inherited connective tissue disorder characterized by fragile skin, easy bruising, and abnormal blood vessels. Elastosis perforans serpiginosa (EPS) is a skin condition that can occur in people with vEDS. EPS is characterized by small, round or oval areas of skin that become thin and wrinkled. The skin may also have a yellowish or brownish discoloration.

The patient in the case presentation has multiple arciform to annular plaques on her extremities, favoring the antecubital and popliteal fossae. These plaques are described as being composed of individual 2- to 4-mm keratotic papules surrounding white atrophic patches. The patient also has remarkable skin atrophy on the dorsal aspects of her hands and feet. The patient's skin is generally pale and translucent with visible veins, especially on the chest and abdomen. The face appears to be emaciated, with a pinched nose, thin lips, sunken cheeks, and prominent eyes. A punch biopsy specimen from an individual papule from the left arm was obtained and analyzed under Verhoeff–van Gieson stain. The biopsy showed a loss of elastic fibers in the papillary dermis.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of EPS. EPS is a well-recognized cutaneous manifestation of vEDS. The clinical features of EPS are characteristic and, in the presence of a compatible family history, make the diagnosis highly likely. A skin biopsy can confirm the diagnosis by demonstrating the loss of elastic fibers in the dermis.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation. Annular elastolytic giant cell granuloma is a rare, benign skin lesion that typically presents as a solitary, well-circumscribed nodule or plaque. Granuloma annulare is a chronic, inflammatory skin condition that typically presents as multiple, small, red or skin-colored papules. Porokeratosis is a rare, genetic skin condition that typically presents as a single, well-defined, scaly patch on the skin.

In conclusion, the patient in the case presentation has vEDS with EPS. The diagnosis is based on the patient's clinical presentation, family history, and skin biopsy findings.

Explanation:

A patent urachus is an abnormal connection between the bladder and the umbilicus. It is a rare congenital anomaly that occurs in about 1 in 4,000 births. The most common symptom of a patent urachus is a discharge of urine from the umbilicus. Other symptoms may include umbilical bleeding, infection, and abdominal pain.

The diagnosis of a patent urachus is made with a physical examination and imaging studies, such as an ultrasound or an X-ray. Treatment of a patent urachus is surgical. The goal of surgery is to close the connection between the bladder and the umbilicus.

The other options are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms. A pyogenic granuloma is a small, red, vascular growth that can occur on the skin. It is usually caused by trauma or infection. An umbilical mucosal polyp is a growth of tissue that can occur in the umbilical cord. It is usually benign and does not require treatment. An umbilical hernia is a protrusion of part of the intestines through the abdominal wall at the umbilicus. It is usually caused by weakness in the abdominal wall muscles.

Explanation:

The patient is a 30-year-old man with progressive quadriplegia for 2 months. The muscle weakness started from the right lower limb and gradually spread to the upper limb and contralateral side. Urinary retention developed 1 month later. He had no history of central nervous system injury or drug overuse. He was a construction supervisor and had daily contact with moist earth. No relevant family history was reported. On physical examination, he was alert and well oriented. The cranial nerve was intact, but he had quadriplegia with a Medical Research Council muscle scale grade of 0 of 5 power, decreased tendon reflexes, and bilateral positive Babinski sign. Pinprick and vibration sensation were markedly impaired below the nipples. Multiple enlarged cervical lymph nodes could be palpitated. The skin was extraordinarily dry, and a pigmentation of 10 mm in diameter at the T2 vertebrae, just on the midline of the back, was noticed. Total blood T-cell count (CD3+) was 1643/uL (to convert to ×109 per liter, multiply by 0.001), and the patient had a CD4+/CD8+ ratio of 0.89. Results of blood testing for human immunodeficiency virus, syphilis, and tuberculosis were negative. Cerebrospinal fluid testing revealed pleocytosis (72 cells/uL; mononuclear cells, 59 of 72), elevated protein concentration (200 mg/dL), and a decreased glucose level (36.0 mg/dL [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0555]), but no organisms were identified on Gram stain or on stain for acid-fast bacilli. Pulmonary computed tomography showed enlarged lymph nodes in mediastinum and axillary regions. Results from magnetic resonance imaging of the brain were normal, while magnetic resonance imaging of the cervical spine revealed multiple intramedullary lesions with enhancement (Figure 1).

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings, the most likely diagnosis is neurosarcoidosis. Neurosarcoidosis is a multisystem disease characterized by noncaseating granulomas in the central nervous system (CNS). The most common CNS manifestations of neurosarcoidosis are cranial nerve palsies, meningitis, and seizures. Other possible manifestations include cerebral vasculitis, hydrocephalus, and spinal cord involvement. The diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis is made based on clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The treatment of neurosarcoidosis is typically with corticosteroids, with or without other immunosuppressive agents.

The other possible diagnoses in this case are tuberculous meningomyelitis, mycotic meningomyelitis, and central nervous system lymphoma. However, these diagnoses are less likely based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings.

Tuberculous meningomyelitis is a rare but serious infection of the meninges (the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The most common symptoms of tuberculous meningomyelitis are headache, fever, and meningismus (stiff neck). Other possible symptoms include seizures, cranial nerve palsies, and focal neurological deficits. The diagnosis of tuberculous meningomyelitis is made based on clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The treatment of tuberculous meningomyelitis is typically with a combination of antituberculosis drugs.

Mycotic meningomyelitis is a rare infection of the meninges caused by fungi. The most common fungi that cause mycotic meningomyelitis are Cryptococcus neoformans, Coccidioides immitis, and Histoplasma capsulatum. The most common symptoms of mycotic meningomyelitis are headache, fever, and meningismus. Other possible symptoms include seizures, cranial nerve palsies, and focal neurological deficits. The diagnosis of mycotic meningomyelitis is made based on clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The treatment of mycotic meningomyelitis is typically with antifungal drugs.

Central nervous system lymphoma is a rare cancer of the brain or spinal cord. The most common symptoms of central nervous system lymphoma are headache, fever, and seizures. Other possible symptoms include cranial nerve palsies, focal neurological deficits, and mental changes. The diagnosis of central nervous system lymphoma is made based on clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The treatment of central nervous system lymphoma is typically with chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

Explanation:

A mucocele is a small, fluid-filled sac that forms on the inside of the mouth. They are most common on the lips, cheeks, and gums, but can also occur on the tongue. Mucoceles are usually caused by a blockage of a salivary gland duct. When the duct is blocked, saliva builds up and forms a cyst.

Mucoceles are usually painless and harmless. However, they can be unsightly and may interfere with eating or talking. In most cases, mucoceles will go away on their own within a few weeks. However, if they are large or cause problems, they can be removed by a doctor.

The patient in this case has a history of recurrent, painless tongue masses. The lesions are usually white and the size of a pinhead, and located on the anterior portion of the tongue. Occasionally they would grow in size and progress to red-filled vesicles that did not burst or bleed. The timing of the lesions was not associated with fever or other rashes. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of mucocele.

Herpes simplex virus infection is a viral infection that can cause cold sores. Cold sores are usually painful and appear as small, red blisters on the lips or mouth. They can also occur on the genitals. Herpes simplex virus infection is usually spread through contact with infected saliva or blood.

Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a genetic disorder that causes tumors to grow on nerves. The tumors can grow anywhere in the body, but are most common on the skin, brain, and spinal cord. Neurofibromatosis type 1 can cause a variety of symptoms, including seizures, learning disabilities, and vision problems.

Oral lymphangioma is a rare congenital disorder that causes abnormal growth of lymphatic tissue in the mouth. Lymphangiomas can be small or large, and can occur anywhere in the mouth. They are usually harmless, but can cause problems if they grow large enough to interfere with eating or breathing.

In conclusion, the patient in this case has a history and physical examination that is most consistent with a diagnosis of mucocele.

Explanation:

Cecal volvulus is a type of large bowel obstruction that occurs when the cecum, the lower right part of the colon, twists on its axis. This can block the flow of stool and cause severe pain, nausea, and vomiting.

The patient in this case presents with several symptoms that are consistent with cecal volvulus, including:

* Abdominal distention
* Tenderness on palpation
* Tachypnea (rapid breathing)
* Dehydration
* Low blood pressure
* Elevated white blood cell count

The plain abdominal radiograph shows a huge colonic distension, which is a classic finding in cecal volvulus. The computed tomography scan shows a coffee-bean-like or “bent inner tube” sign, which is another characteristic finding of cecal volvulus.

The other options are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms or findings on imaging.

* Aerophagia is the swallowing of air, which can cause abdominal distention and bloating. However, it does not typically cause pain, tenderness, or other symptoms.
* Sigmoid volvulus is a type of large bowel obstruction that occurs when the sigmoid colon, the lower left part of the colon, twists on its axis. However, it does not typically cause abdominal distention that is as severe as the patient in this case.
* Colonic ileus/colonic pseudoobstruction (Ogilvie syndrome) is a condition in which the colon becomes obstructed due to a lack of peristalsis (the movement of the bowels). However, it does not typically cause the coffee-bean-like or “bent inner tube” sign that is seen on computed tomography scan.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a small-bowel obstruction. The abdominal plain radiograph shows a distended, thickened stomach and multiple dilated loops of small bowel with air-fluid levels. The contrast-enhanced computed tomography demonstrates a focal area of mixed fat density involving the distal small bowel concerning for a lead point with adjacent mesenteric fat stranding. The scan also revealed multiple bilateral lung nodules.

The most likely cause of the small-bowel obstruction in this patient is intussusception secondary to pelvic adhesions. Intussusception is a condition in which one segment of the bowel telescopes into another segment. This can occur due to a number of factors, including a lead point, such as a polyp or tumor, or a mechanical obstruction, such as adhesions.

Pelvic adhesions are bands of scar tissue that can form in the pelvis after surgery or inflammation. These adhesions can cause a number of problems, including small-bowel obstruction.

The patient's history of a total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy puts her at increased risk for developing pelvic adhesions. The presence of multiple bilateral lung nodules is concerning for metastatic lung cancer. However, the patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with metastatic lung cancer. Additionally, the contrast-enhanced computed tomography does not show any evidence of metastatic lung cancer.

Phytobezoar is a mass of undigested plant material that can form in the stomach. This can occur in patients with poor oral hygiene or who eat a diet high in fiber. The patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with phytobezoar. Additionally, the contrast-enhanced computed tomography does not show any evidence of phytobezoar.

Endometriosis is a condition in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside of the uterus. This can cause a number of problems, including infertility, pain, and bowel obstruction. The patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with endometriosis. Additionally, the contrast-enhanced computed tomography does not show any evidence of endometriosis.

Therefore, the most likely cause of the small-bowel obstruction in this patient is intussusception secondary to pelvic adhesions.

 60%|█████▉    | 910/1525 [3:28:10<2:34:18, 15.05s/it]Answer: D. Percutaneous coronary intervention of the total RCA occlusion.

Explanation:
The patient is a 67-year-old man with a medical history of hypertension who presented to the hospital after noting irregular heartbeats on his home blood pressure monitor. He had no palpitations. The electrocardiogram showed several premature ventricular contractions. Results of 30-day Holter monitoring were obtained, and more than 5000 premature ventricular contractions were recorded, including occasional polymorphic ventricular couplets.

Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal left ventricular internal dimensions and systolic function. All valves were structurally normal with trace mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. A treadmill exercise stress test demonstrated 2 mm horizontal ST-segment depression in inferior and apical leads with exercise. Cardiac catheterization of the left side of the heart was performed and demonstrated a total occlusion of the right coronary artery.

The patient's symptoms and findings are consistent with coronary artery disease. The right coronary artery supplies blood to the inferior wall of the left ventricle, which is why the patient is experiencing chest pain and ST-segment depression in the inferior leads on the electrocardiogram. The total occlusion of the right coronary artery is a high-risk situation, as it could lead to a heart attack.

The best course of treatment for this patient is percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), which is a procedure that involves opening up the blocked artery with a balloon and stent. PCI is a minimally invasive procedure that is very effective in treating coronary artery disease. It is the preferred treatment for patients with acute coronary syndrome, such as the patient in this case.

The other options are not appropriate for this patient. Medical therapy with β-blocker, nifedipine, long-acting nitrate, and flecainide acetate would not be effective in treating the total occlusion of the right coronary artery. Transposition of the RCA from the pulmonary artery to the aorta is a very complex and risky surgery that is not routinely performed. Left internal mammary artery graft to the left anterior descending artery is a procedure that is used to bypass a blockage in the left anterior descending artery, but it would not be effective in treating the blockage in the right coronary artery.

Therefore, the best course of treatment for this patient is PCI.

Explanation:
The marked discordance between the direct and calculated LDL levels is related to the effects of very LDL (VLDL), intermediate-density LDL (IDL), and/or Lp(a).

The patient's direct LDL-C level was 115 mg/dL in October 2015, but a calculated LDL-C was 170 mg/dL in December 2015. This discordance is likely due to the effects of VLDL, IDL, and/or Lp(a).

VLDL is a type of lipoprotein that carries triglycerides. When VLDL is converted to IDL, it loses some of its triglycerides and becomes more cholesterol-rich. Lp(a) is a lipoprotein that is similar to LDL, but it has an additional protein called apolipoprotein (a). Apolipoprotein (a) is thought to increase the risk of heart disease.

In the patient's case, it is likely that his VLDL, IDL, and/or Lp(a) levels were elevated, which caused his calculated LDL-C level to be higher than his direct LDL-C level.

The other answer choices are incorrect because:

* Answer A is incorrect because there is no evidence of a laboratory error.
* Answer B is incorrect because the patient does not have the clinical features of familial dysbetalipoproteinemia.
* Answer D is incorrect because the patient's VLDL levels are likely not elevated enough to account for the discordance between his direct and calculated LDL-C levels.

The patient presented with a slow-growing, infiltrative sinonasal mass with intracranial involvement. The mass was shown to be an infiltrative, low-grade, malignant spindle cell neoplasm with immunoreactivity for BCL2 protein and neural marker, S-100 protein, and focal immunoreactivity for smooth muscle markers SMA and HHF35. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of low-grade malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST).

MPNSTs are rare, malignant tumors that arise from Schwann cells, the cells that myelinate peripheral nerves. They can occur anywhere in the body, but are most common in the extremities. MPNSTs are classified as low-grade or high-grade tumors, based on their histologic appearance and clinical behavior. Low-grade MPNSTs are typically slow-growing and have a good prognosis, while high-grade MPNSTs are more aggressive and have a poorer prognosis.

The treatment of MPNST is surgery, followed by radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy. The goal of treatment is to achieve local control of the tumor and to prevent metastasis. The prognosis for patients with MPNST depends on the grade of the tumor and the extent of disease at the time of diagnosis. Patients with low-grade MPNST have a good prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate of 70%. Patients with high-grade MPNST have a poorer prognosis, with a 5-year survival rate of 30%.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation or the pathologic findings.

* Monophasic synovial sarcoma is a rare, malignant tumor that arises from the synovium, the lining of joints. It is most common in young adults and typically presents as a soft tissue mass in an extremity. Monophasic synovial sarcoma is classified as a high-grade sarcoma and has a poor prognosis.
* Biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma is a rare, malignant tumor that arises from the sinonasal mucosa. It is most common in adults and typically presents as a polypoid mass in the nose or sinuses. Biphenotypic sinonasal sarcoma is classified as a high-grade sarcoma and has a poor prognosis.
* Glomangiopericytoma is a rare, benign tumor that arises from pericytes, cells that surround blood vessels. It is most common in adults and typically presents as a soft tissue mass in the extremities. Glomangiopericytoma is usually slow-growing and has a good prognosis.

Explanation:

The patient is a woman in her 60s who presented with mild to moderate trismus and swelling on the left side of the face of a few months’ duration. Her medical history was significant for herpes zoster and self-limited vertigo approximately 3 years prior. Her physical examination was remarkable for left-sided facial swelling. No deficits of the facial or trigeminal nerves were detected. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed, which showed a mass lying on the anterior surface of the eroded left mandibular condyle with homogeneous isointensity relative to skeletal muscle on T1-weighted imaging, homogeneous, avid enhancement of the mass on postcontrast T1-weighted imaging with fat suppression, homogeneous moderately hyperintense signal on T2-weighted imaging, and marked diffusion restriction on diffusion-weighted imaging.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is osteosarcoma. Osteosarcoma is a malignant neoplasm of bone that typically occurs in children and adolescents. It is characterized by the formation of osteoid, a precursor to bone. Osteosarcoma can occur in any bone, but it is most common in the long bones of the extremities, such as the femur, tibia, and humerus. The most common presenting symptom of osteosarcoma is pain, which is often accompanied by swelling and tenderness. Other symptoms may include fever, weight loss, and fatigue.

The diagnosis of osteosarcoma is made based on clinical findings, imaging studies, and biopsy. Imaging studies such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRI can help to identify the location and extent of the tumor. Biopsy is the only way to definitively diagnose osteosarcoma. Biopsy involves the removal of a small piece of tissue from the tumor, which is then examined under a microscope by a pathologist.

The treatment of osteosarcoma typically involves surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. Surgery is the primary treatment for osteosarcoma. The goal of surgery is to remove the tumor as completely as possible. Chemotherapy is used to kill any cancer cells that may have spread beyond the tumor. Radiation therapy is used to kill any cancer cells that remain after surgery and chemotherapy.

The prognosis for osteosarcoma is variable. The overall survival rate for patients with osteosarcoma is approximately 60%. The prognosis is better for patients who are diagnosed with osteosarcoma at an early stage and who receive aggressive treatment.

The other options are incorrect because they are not the most likely diagnosis in this case. Plasmacytoma is a malignant neoplasm of plasma cells, which are white blood cells that produce antibodies. Ameloblastoma is a benign neoplasm of odontogenic epithelium, which is the tissue that forms teeth. Venous malformation is a congenital abnormality of the veins.

Explanation:

The patient is a white man in his 40s who presented with a slowly enlarging, nontender, left-sided neck mass at the angle of the mandible that had been present for 4 years. Fine-needle aspiration was performed twice, each time with inconclusive results. Computed tomography (CT) of the neck showed a heterogeneous mass located immediately adjacent to the tail of the left parotid. No other masses were noted. He underwent a left superficial parotidectomy with en bloc removal of the mass. Pathologic findings revealed a 3.0 × 2.9 × 1.9-cm, encapsulated, tan, soft nodule within the specimen. The nodule had peripheral cystic spaces as well as focal areas of hemorrhage and a 0.5 × 0.4 × 0.4-cm area of calcification within the periphery. The entire tumor was confined within a periparotid lymph node, almost completely replacing it. Histopathologic findings (Figure) showed a mixture of dark, granular, basophilic acinar cells and eosinophilic intercalated ductal cells. The acinar cells contained periodic acid–Schiff–positive, diastase-resistant intracytoplasmic granules, whereas the ductal cells were both fusiform and cuboidal forming small ductlike structures. The neoplasm also exhibited focal areas of hyaline sclerosis without necrosis.

Acinic cell carcinoma is a rare, low-grade salivary gland neoplasm that accounts for approximately 5% of all salivary gland tumors. It is most commonly seen in the parotid gland, followed by the submandibular gland. The tumor typically presents as a slow-growing, painless mass. Acinic cell carcinoma is usually diagnosed on the basis of clinical presentation, imaging studies, and biopsy. Treatment typically involves surgical excision with or without radiation therapy. The prognosis for acinic cell carcinoma is excellent, with most patients having long-term survival.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Pleomorphic adenoma is the most common type of salivary gland tumor, accounting for approximately 80% of all cases. It is a benign neoplasm that typically presents as a slow-growing, painless mass. Pleomorphic adenoma is usually diagnosed on the basis of clinical presentation, imaging studies, and biopsy. Treatment typically involves surgical excision. The prognosis for pleomorphic adenoma is excellent, with most patients having long-term survival.
* Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is the second most common type of salivary gland tumor, accounting for approximately 15% of all cases. It is a malignant neoplasm that can be low-grade, intermediate-grade, or high-grade. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma typically presents as a slow-growing, painless mass. The tumor is usually diagnosed on the basis of clinical presentation, imaging studies, and biopsy. Treatment typically involves surgical excision with or without radiation therapy. The prognosis for mucoepidermoid carcinoma depends on the grade of the tumor. Low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma has an excellent prognosis, with most patients having long-term survival. Intermediate-grade and high-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma have a poorer prognosis, with a risk of recurrence and metastasis.
* HIV-associated benign lymphoepithelial cyst is a rare, benign condition that is seen in patients with HIV infection. It typically presents as a painless mass in the parotid gland. The cyst is usually diagnosed on the basis of clinical presentation, imaging studies, and biopsy. Treatment is usually not necessary, as the cyst will resolve spontaneously in most cases. However, in some cases, the cyst may need to be surgically removed. The prognosis for HIV-associated benign lymphoepithelial cyst is excellent.

Explanation:

The most likely diagnosis is esthesioneuroblastoma, a rare but aggressive neoplasm of the olfactory epithelium. The patient's history of progressive blurred vision, right eye swelling, and forehead tenderness is consistent with a mass lesion in the right nasal cavity that is invading the orbit. The CT scan and MRI findings show a mass in the right ethmoid complex with invasion of the orbit and extension to the nasal cavity. The PET scan shows increased uptake within the right ethmoid air cells and nasal cavity, and in the medial right orbit. These findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of esthesioneuroblastoma.

Rhabdomyosarcoma is a soft tissue sarcoma that can occur in the head and neck region. However, it is more common in children than in adults. The patient in this case is a teenage boy, so rhabdomyosarcoma is a possible diagnosis. However, the CT scan and MRI findings are not typical for rhabdomyosarcoma. Rhabdomyosarcoma is more likely to show a heterogeneous mass with calcifications. The PET scan is also not typical for rhabdomyosarcoma. Rhabdomyosarcoma is not typically a PET-avid tumor.

Ethmoid mucocele is a benign cystic lesion that can occur in the ethmoid sinus. It is more common in adults than in children. The patient in this case is a teenage boy, so ethmoid mucocele is less likely than esthesioneuroblastoma. The CT scan and MRI findings are not typical for ethmoid mucocele. Ethmoid mucoceles are typically smooth, round lesions that do not invade the orbit. The PET scan is also not typical for ethmoid mucocele. Ethmoid mucoceles are not typically PET-avid tumors.

Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma is a rare, aggressive carcinoma of the sinonasal tract. It is more common in adults than in children. The patient in this case is a teenage boy, so sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma is less likely than esthesioneuroblastoma. The CT scan and MRI findings are not typical for sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma. Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinomas are typically heterogeneous masses with calcifications. The PET scan is also not typical for sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma. Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinomas are not typically PET-avid tumors.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for the patient in this case is esthesioneuroblastoma.

The patient in this case presents with a number of concerning symptoms, including headaches, blurry vision, and paresthesia in her hands. These symptoms are consistent with a number of potential diagnoses, including multiple sclerosis, optic neuritis, and intracranial hypertension. In order to narrow down the differential diagnosis and determine the best course of treatment, it is necessary to perform further testing.

Lumbar puncture is a procedure in which a needle is inserted into the spinal canal to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF is a clear fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. It can be used to test for a number of conditions, including multiple sclerosis, optic neuritis, and intracranial hypertension.

In this case, performing a lumbar puncture would allow the doctor to measure the opening pressure of the CSF, which can be elevated in cases of intracranial hypertension. The doctor would also be able to test the CSF for the presence of inflammatory cells, which would be suggestive of multiple sclerosis or optic neuritis.

Observing the patient and treating her headaches conservatively would not be the best course of action in this case, as the patient's symptoms could be indicative of a serious underlying condition. Consulting surgery for immediate surgical intervention would also not be the best course of action, as there is no evidence that the patient requires surgery at this time.

Beginning treatment with high-dose corticosteroids could potentially be helpful in treating multiple sclerosis or optic neuritis, but it is important to first confirm the diagnosis with further testing. Therefore, the best course of action in this case is to perform a lumbar puncture with opening pressure, routine chemistry, and cell count analysis.

Explanation:

The patient is a man in his 50s with an unremarkable ocular history who was referred for atypical corneal deposits of the right eye. On examination, visual acuity was 20/25 OD with correction, and the superior cornea showed an intact epithelium, mild stromal thinning, and pannus with faint yellow-white subepithelial deposits at the leading edge. There were no other abnormalities reported on examination. The patient was treated conservatively with lubrication.

A year later, best-corrected visual acuity had decreased to 20/30 OD with against-the-rule astigmatism. There was progressive corneal thinning and a dense, serpentine network of subepithelial deposits with adjacent neovascularization in the superior cornea, extending toward the visual axis.

The most likely diagnosis is Terrien marginal degeneration, a rare, bilateral, non-inflammatory corneal dystrophy characterized by progressive thinning and pannus formation of the superior cornea. The disease is typically seen in middle-aged and elderly men, and there is no known cure. Treatment is aimed at relieving symptoms and slowing the progression of the disease. Options include topical steroids, lubricants, and bandage contact lenses. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary, such as crescent-shaped lamellar keratoplasty, which involves removing a crescent-shaped piece of diseased cornea and replacing it with healthy donor tissue.

The other options are not appropriate for this patient. B. Thorough ocular adnexal evaluation with eyelid eversion is a necessary part of the initial evaluation of any patient with corneal disease, but it is not the next step in the management of this patient. C. Subconjunctival injection of anti–vascular endothelial growth factor medication is a treatment option for corneal neovascularization, but it is not indicated for this patient, who does not have neovascularization. D. Refraction with rigid gas permeable contact lens fitting may be helpful in improving visual acuity, but it is not the next step in the management of this patient.

The patient in this case developed uveitis after receiving an intravenous infusion of zoledronic acid. Uveitis is an inflammation of the uvea, which is the middle layer of the eye. It is a common side effect of bisphosphonates, which are a class of drugs used to treat Paget disease of the bone.

In this case, the patient's uveitis resolved after treatment with topical steroids. However, there is a risk that the uveitis could recur if the patient receives further doses of zoledronic acid. Therefore, the best course of action is to advise the patient's endocrinologist to request an alternative to a bisphosphonate.

Options B, C, and D are incorrect because they do not take into account the risk of the patient's uveitis recurring. Option B would involve re-exposing the patient to the drug that caused the uveitis in the first place, which is a risky proposition. Option C would involve treating the patient with steroids before the next dose of zoledronic acid, but this would not prevent the uveitis from occurring in the first place. Option D would involve treating the patient's uveitis as if it were an unrelated idiopathic uveitis, but this would not address the underlying cause of the uveitis, which is the patient's bisphosphonate treatment.

The patient has signs and symptoms of orbital cellulitis, which is a serious infection of the tissues around the eye. Orbital cellulitis can be caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. It is most commonly caused by bacteria that enter the body through a break in the skin, such as a cut or scrape. The most common bacteria that cause orbital cellulitis are Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae.

Orbital cellulitis is a medical emergency. If not treated promptly, it can lead to vision loss, blindness, and even death. The treatment for orbital cellulitis is intravenous antibiotics. The antibiotics are given in a hospital setting so that the patient can be monitored closely.

In this case, the patient has a fever, elevated white blood cell count, and significant swelling and erythema of the eyelids. He also has a history of diabetes, which makes him more susceptible to infections. Based on these findings, the patient is at high risk for developing complications from orbital cellulitis. Therefore, he should be admitted to the hospital for intravenous antibiotics.

The other options are incorrect because they do not provide adequate treatment for orbital cellulitis. Option A, beginning oral antibiotics and discharging home with follow-up the next day, is not adequate treatment for orbital cellulitis. Orbital cellulitis is a serious infection that requires treatment with intravenous antibiotics. Option C, performing bedside incision and drainage of the blisters and admitting for intravenous antibiotics, is also not adequate treatment. Incision and drainage of the blisters may help to relieve pressure and pain, but it does not provide adequate treatment for the infection. Option D, performing aggressive debridement of the eyelids in the operating room and giving intravenous antibiotics, is an option for patients with severe orbital cellulitis. However, it is not necessary for all patients with orbital cellulitis. In this case, the patient does not have severe orbital cellulitis, so aggressive debridement is not necessary.

In conclusion, the correct answer is: **B: Admit for intravenous antibiotics**.

The patient has a history of high-grade osteosarcoma with areas of leimyosarcoma of the tibia which had been treated with right above-knee amputation and chemotherapy 4 years prior to presentation. She was followed up in the oncology clinic without any recurrence or metastases. Her last visit was 6 months earlier. She was also diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix 2 months earlier and was awaiting surgery. Computed tomography (CT) of the neck revealed a 6.0 × 3.4 × 4.4-cm calcified left thyroid lobe mass (Figure, A). Positron emission tomography–computed tomographic (PET-CT) imaging showed increased uptake in the left thyroid gland. She underwent a left thyroid lobectomy. The neoplastic cells were positive for p53, vimentin, and smooth muscle actin, and negative for S-100, thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), and CD34 (Figure, B).

A: Thyroid lymphoma is unlikely because the patient does not have any of the typical risk factors for lymphoma, such as an autoimmune disease, immunosuppression, or a family history of lymphoma. Additionally, the neoplastic cells in the thyroid gland were negative for S-100, which is a marker of lymphoma.

B: Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is a rare and aggressive type of thyroid cancer. It is typically diagnosed in older adults and is often associated with a history of radiation exposure. The patient does not have any of the typical risk factors for anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, and the neoplastic cells in the thyroid gland were negative for TTF-1, which is a marker of thyroid cancer.

C: Osteosarcoma metastasis is the most likely diagnosis in this case. The patient has a history of osteosarcoma, which is a type of bone cancer. The neoplastic cells in the thyroid gland were positive for p53, which is a mutation that is often found in osteosarcoma. Additionally, the neoplastic cells were positive for vimentin and smooth muscle actin, which are markers of mesenchymal tumors.

D: Squamous cell carcinoma metastasis is less likely than osteosarcoma metastasis in this case. The patient has a history of squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, but the neoplastic cells in the thyroid gland were negative for S-100, which is a marker of squamous cell carcinoma. Additionally, the neoplastic cells were positive for vimentin and smooth muscle actin, which are markers of mesenchymal tumors.

The infant's facial rash, fever, and anemia are all consistent with congenital syphilis. Congenital syphilis is a serious infection that can occur when a pregnant woman with syphilis passes the infection to her unborn baby. The infection can cause a variety of health problems in the infant, including skin rash, fever, anemia, and developmental delays.

Serologic testing is the most accurate way to diagnose congenital syphilis. A serologic test looks for antibodies to the syphilis bacterium in the blood. If the infant tests positive for syphilis, he will need to be treated with antibiotics. Treatment is usually successful in preventing serious complications.

A: Providing education on proper facial cleansing and moisturizing would not be the most appropriate next step in this case. The infant's rash is most likely due to an underlying medical condition, such as congenital syphilis. Treatment of the underlying condition is necessary to clear the rash.

B: Administering topical antifungals would not be the most appropriate next step in this case. The infant's rash is most likely due to an underlying medical condition, such as congenital syphilis. Topical antifungals are not effective against syphilis.

C: Ordering antinuclear antibody, anti-Ro/SS-A, and anti-La/SS-B antibody testing for both the infant and his mother would not be the most appropriate next step in this case.

Explanation:

Cutaneous malakoplakia is a rare, benign, granulomatous skin condition that is characterized by the accumulation of macrophages containing Michaelis-Gutmann bodies. It is most commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, such as those with chronic graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). The lesions of cutaneous malakoplakia are typically yellow-brown papules or nodules that are located on the skin, mucous membranes, or gastrointestinal tract. The diagnosis of cutaneous malakoplakia is made by biopsy, which shows the characteristic accumulation of Michaelis-Gutmann bodies in macrophages. The treatment of cutaneous malakoplakia is with antibiotics, such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or doxycycline.

The other possible diagnoses are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Atypical mycobacterial infection is a possible diagnosis in immunocompromised patients, but it is not typically associated with the skin lesions described in the case.
* Cryptococcosis is a fungal infection that can cause skin lesions, but it is more commonly seen in the lungs or central nervous system.

The patient in this case has a history of discoid lupus, and the lesions are restricted to areas of the tattoo where white ink was layered over red ink. This suggests that the lesions may be due to a foreign-body reaction to the white ink. Pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia is a common reaction to foreign bodies in the skin, and it is characterized by a verrucous or acanthotic appearance. The histopathologic findings in this case are consistent with pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia. Eruptive keratoacanthomas are a rare skin condition that is characterized by the sudden appearance of multiple keratoacanthomas. Sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect multiple organs, including the skin. The lesions of sarcoidosis are typically non-tender and non-pruritic, and they are not associated with a history of discoid lupus.

Explanation:
The patient in the case presented has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which is an autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organ systems, including the skin. The patient's current presentation of fever, generalized eruption, and atypical target lesions is consistent with a flare of SLE.

Pemphigus erythematosus is an autoimmune blistering disorder that is often associated with SLE. The patient's rash is consistent with pemphigus erythematosus, as it is characterized by flaccid bullae and target lesions. However, the patient's history of SLE and her other laboratory findings, including hypocomplementemia and positive antinuclear antibodies, are more consistent with a flare of SLE than with pemphigus erythematosus.

Generalized fixed drug eruption is a type of drug reaction that is characterized by the development of erythematous, edematous plaques that resolve with central clearing. The patient's rash is not consistent with a generalized fixed drug eruption, as it does not have the characteristic central clearing.

Rowell syndrome is a rare, autoimmune disorder that is characterized by the development of bullous lesions on the hands and feet. The patient's rash is not consistent with Rowell syndrome, as it does not involve the hands and feet.

Toxic epidermal necrolysis is a severe, life-threatening skin reaction that is characterized by the widespread shedding of the skin. The patient's rash is not consistent with toxic epidermal necrolysis, as it is not as severe or widespread.

In conclusion, the patient's most likely diagnosis is a flare of SLE. The patient's history of SLE, her current presentation, and her laboratory findings are all consistent with a flare of SLE.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a demyelinating disease. The recurrent, transient episodes of dysarthria, dysphagia, and limb weakness are characteristic of multiple sclerosis (MS). The presence of bilateral positive Babinski signs is also suggestive of MS. The MRI findings of abnormal bilateral increases in T2 signal and diffusion restriction in the periventricular areas and the splenium of corpus callosum are consistent with MS. The electrophysiological examination of peripheral nerves revealed extensive bilateral nerve conduction abnormalities, which is also consistent with MS.

A transient ischemic attack (TIA) is a temporary blockage of blood flow to the brain that causes symptoms such as weakness, numbness, or difficulty speaking. TIAs are usually caused by a blood clot that forms in an artery in the neck or brain. The symptoms of a TIA usually resolve within a few hours, but they can be a warning sign of a stroke.

Periodic paralysis is a rare genetic disorder that causes episodes of muscle weakness. The weakness can be mild or severe, and it can affect any muscle in the body. The episodes of weakness usually last for a few hours or days, and they can be triggered by exercise, stress, or changes in temperature.

X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is a genetic disorder that causes progressive weakness and wasting of the muscles in the hands and feet. The weakness usually starts in childhood or adolescence, and it can progress to involve the muscles in the arms and legs. The disease is caused by a mutation in the PMP22 gene, which is located on the X chromosome.

In conclusion, the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are most consistent with a demyelinating disease, such as MS.

Explanation:
Cavernous sinus syndrome is a neurological disorder that occurs when the cavernous sinus, a large venous sinus in the skull, becomes inflamed or infected. This can cause a variety of symptoms, including diplopia (double vision), ptosis (drooping eyelid), facial pain, and numbness in the face. In some cases, cavernous sinus syndrome can also cause vision loss, hearing loss, and seizures.

The most common cause of cavernous sinus syndrome is an infection, such as an abscess or meningitis. Other causes include tumors, trauma, and autoimmune disorders.

The diagnosis of cavernous sinus syndrome is made based on the patient's history and physical examination. Imaging tests, such as a computed tomography (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, may be used to confirm the diagnosis.

The treatment of cavernous sinus syndrome depends on the underlying cause. In some cases, treatment may involve surgery to remove the source of the infection or tumor. In other cases, treatment may involve antibiotics or other medications.

The prognosis for cavernous sinus syndrome varies depending on the underlying cause. In most cases, the condition can be treated successfully. However, in some cases, the condition can be life-threatening.

The patient in the case presented has several features that are consistent with cavernous sinus syndrome. These include diplopia, ptosis, facial pain, and numbness in the face. The patient's history of a pituitary macroadenoma, which was resected 30 years prior, followed by radiation, is also a risk factor for cavernous sinus syndrome.

The other options are not as likely in this case. Ocular myasthenia is a neuromuscular disorder that causes weakness of the muscles that control eye movement. It is not typically associated with facial pain or numbness. Ocular neuromyotonia of the third nerve is a rare disorder that causes involuntary contractions of the third cranial nerve, which controls eye movement. It is not typically associated with facial pain or numbness. Giant cell arteritis is a vasculitis that affects large and medium-sized arteries. It is not typically associated with facial pain or numbness.

 61%|██████    | 927/1525 [3:32:08<2:28:41, 14.92s/it]The correct answer is: **A: Multiple system atrophy**

Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a group of neurodegenerative disorders that affect the autonomic nervous system, the basal ganglia, and the cerebellum. The most common symptoms of MSA are tremor, postural instability, and gait difficulty. Other symptoms may include urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, and sleep apnea.

The diagnosis of MSA is based on a combination of clinical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. Brain imaging studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), can be helpful in confirming the diagnosis.

There is no cure for MSA, but there are treatments that can help to manage the symptoms. These treatments may include medications, physical therapy, and occupational therapy.

The following are the reasons why the other options are incorrect:

* **Vascular dementia** is a type of dementia that is caused by damage to the blood vessels in the brain. The most common symptoms of vascular dementia are memory loss, confusion, and changes in personality and behavior.
* **Fragile X–associated tremor ataxia syndrome** is a genetic disorder that causes tremor, ataxia, and intellectual disability. The tremor is usually present from birth, and the ataxia and intellectual disability usually develop in childhood.
* **Essential tremor** is the most common type of tremor. It is a movement disorder that causes involuntary, rhythmic shaking of the hands, head, voice, and sometimes other parts of the body. Essential tremor is usually mild and does not cause any significant disability.

In the case of the 58-year-old man, the most likely diagnosis is MSA. The patient's history of progressive action tremor in his dominant hand when writing, subtle balance problems without falls developing over the past 3 years, and cognitive testing revealing deficits in executive function and speed of information processing are all consistent with MSA. The patient's medical history, family history, and lifestyle habits are not suggestive of any other underlying medical conditions. The brain MRI findings of moderate volume loss in the cerebral hemispheres bilaterally as well as the cerebellum and brainstem, and abnormal signal intensity in the cerebral hemispheric white matter bilaterally, the middle cerebellar peduncles, the cerebellar white matter, and the pons are also consistent with MSA.

Explanation:
The most likely diagnosis is a hemangioma, which is a benign tumor of blood vessels. Hemangiomas are the most common type of tumor in newborns, affecting up to 10% of infants. They are usually present at birth or appear within the first few weeks of life. Hemangiomas can occur anywhere on the body, but they are most common on the head, neck, and face.

The most common type of hemangioma is a strawberry hemangioma, which is a red, raised lesion that can be flat or raised. Strawberry hemangiomas often grow rapidly in the first few months of life, then plateau and gradually fade over time. In most cases, hemangiomas will disappear completely by the time a child is 5 years old.

Other types of hemangiomas include cavernous hemangiomas, which are deep, purplish lesions that can occur anywhere on the body, and port-wine stains, which are flat, red birthmarks that are often present on the face.

Hemangiomas are usually not harmful, but they can cause problems if they grow large or if they are located in a sensitive area, such as the eye or airway. Treatment for hemangiomas is usually not necessary, but in some cases, surgery or laser therapy may be used to remove the lesion.

In the case of the 11-day-old girl in the question, the most likely diagnosis is a hemangioma. The girl has a red patch on the central lower back with a soft nodule located on top of the patch. Additionally, she has a pedunculated red papule positioned on top of the red stain and soft nodule. These findings are consistent with a hemangioma.

A teratoma is a rare type of tumor that can develop from any germ cell line. Teratomas can contain a variety of tissues, including skin, hair, teeth, and bone. They can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the ovaries, testicles, and brain.

Spinal dysraphism is a group of birth defects that affect the development of the spine and spinal cord. Spinal dysraphism can include spina bifida, myelomeningocele, and tethered cord syndrome.

A dermoid cyst is a type of cyst that is lined with skin cells. Dermoid cysts can occur anywhere on the body, but they are most common on the head, neck, and face.

All of these conditions are possible diagnoses for the girl in the question, but hemangioma is the most likely diagnosis based on the available information.

The patient has severe hypercholesterolemia with a unique composition and distribution of lipid classes in a special form of dyslipidemia known as lipoprotein X (LpX). This is a rare condition that is associated with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Therapeutic plasma exchange is the treatment of choice for LpX-associated hypercholesterolemia. It is a procedure that removes the abnormal lipoproteins from the blood and replaces them with normal lipoproteins. Rosuvastatin is a statin that is used to lower cholesterol levels. It is also effective in treating LpX-associated hypercholesterolemia.

The other options are incorrect because they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's hypercholesterolemia. Option A, resolve obstructive cholestasis with biliary stent placement, would only treat the symptoms of the patient's PSC. Option B, begin rosuvastatin, 20 mg per day, would only treat the patient's hypercholesterolemia, but it would not address the underlying cause of the condition. Option D, begin therapeutic plasma exchange, would be the correct treatment if the patient did not have PSC. However, because the patient has PSC, therapeutic plasma exchange plus rosuvastatin, 20 mg per day, is the best treatment option.

Explanation:
The patient presented with vertigo and facial nerve weakness, which are both symptoms of middle ear paraganglioma. The patient also had a mass in the middle ear that was found to be vascular on imaging. Middle ear paragangliomas are the most common type of paraganglioma in the head and neck, and they are typically highly vascular. The patient's mass was also found to be positive for synaptophysin and S-100, which are markers of neuroendocrine cells. Middle ear paragangliomas are derived from neuroendocrine cells, and they typically stain positive for these markers.

Facial nerve hemangioma, facial nerve schwannoma, and middle ear adenoma are all less likely diagnoses in this case. Facial nerve hemangiomas are rare, and they are typically not associated with vertigo or facial nerve weakness. Facial nerve schwannomas are more common than facial nerve hemangiomas, but they are also not typically associated with vertigo or facial nerve weakness. Middle ear adenomas are rare, and they are typically not associated with vertigo or facial nerve weakness.

In conclusion, the patient's diagnosis is most likely middle ear paraganglioma.

Explanation: The patient presented with a cystic lesion of the lower lip that had developed spontaneously and was associated with a long-term history of substance abuse. The lesion was nontender, mobile, and approximately 1 × 1 cm in size. On palpation, it was found to contain clear serous fluid. The lesion was excised surgically and the specimen sent for histological examination.

The histopathologic findings revealed an endophytic growing lesion that consisted of an acanthotic epidermoid epithelium organized in broad papillary folds, with at its periphery an infiltrating border. At the surface of these papillae, the epithelium was sometimes columnar. Mucocytes were present, individually dispersed throughout the epithelium, but also organized in small tubuloacinar structures emptying onto the surface. The epithelium was infiltrated by neutrophils. Atypia or mitotic figures were absent, and the subepithelial stroma contained normal-appearing seromucous acini.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a low-grade malignancy that arises from the salivary glands. It is the most common salivary gland malignancy in children and adolescents, but it can occur at any age. The most common presenting symptom is a painless mass in the oral cavity. Mucoepidermoid carcinomas are classified based on the degree of differentiation of the epithelial cells. Well-differentiated tumors are the most common type and have a good prognosis. Poorly differentiated tumors are rare and have a poor prognosis.

The treatment of mucoepidermoid carcinoma depends on the stage of the disease. Well-differentiated tumors can be treated with surgery alone. Poorly differentiated tumors require surgery and radiation therapy. The prognosis for patients with mucoepidermoid carcinoma is good overall, with a 5-year survival rate of 90% for well-differentiated tumors and 50% for poorly differentiated tumors.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not match the clinical and histopathologic findings in this case. Intraductal papilloma is a benign tumor that arises from the ducts of the salivary glands. It is usually a small, asymptomatic mass that is found incidentally on imaging studies. Mucoele is a non-neoplastic lesion that is caused by the obstruction of a salivary gland duct. It is a fluid-filled sac that can occur anywhere in the oral cavity. Oral inverted ductal papilloma is a rare, benign tumor that arises from the ducts of the salivary glands. It is usually a small, asymptomatic mass that is found incidentally on imaging studies.

Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibromas are benign, locally aggressive tumors that occur almost exclusively in adolescent males. They are believed to arise from the sphenopalatine artery and its branches. The most common presenting symptoms are nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and facial pain. On physical examination, a mass may be palpated in the nasopharynx or infratemporal fossa. Imaging studies, such as CT or MRI, can help to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of the tumor. Treatment typically involves surgical resection, with or without adjuvant radiation therapy.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a malignant tumor that can occur in both males and females. It is the most common type of head and neck cancer in Southeast Asia, but it is rare in the United States. The most common presenting symptoms are nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and otalgia. On physical examination, a mass may be palpated in the nasopharynx. Imaging studies, such as CT or MRI, can help to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of the tumor. Treatment typically involves a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.
* Rhabdomyosarcoma is a malignant tumor of striated muscle. It can occur in any part of the body, but it is most common in children and young adults. The most common presenting symptoms depend on the location of the tumor. For example, a rhabdomyosarcoma of the head and neck may present with nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and facial pain. On physical examination, a mass may be palpated. Imaging studies, such as CT or MRI, can help to confirm the diagnosis and assess the extent of the tumor. Treatment typically involves a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.
* Inverted papilloma is a benign tumor of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. It is more common in adults than in children. The most common presenting symptom is nasal obstruction. On physical examination, a mass may be palpated in the nasal cavity. Imaging studies, such as CT or MRI, can help to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment typically involves surgical excision.

 61%|██████    | 933/1525 [3:33:40<2:33:51, 15.59s/it]The answer is A: Venous malformation.

Explanation:
The patient has a history of recurrent unilateral swelling of the parotid gland, which is a classic presentation of venous malformation. The MRI findings are also consistent with a venous malformation, as the lesion is T2 hyperintense and demonstrates homogenous contrast enhancement. Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are typically high-flow lesions that would be expected to demonstrate rapid and intense contrast enhancement. Chronic sialadenitis is a non-neoplastic inflammatory condition that would not be expected to cause recurrent swelling or to be T2 hyperintense on MRI. Lymphatic malformations are typically cystic lesions that would not be expected to be T2 hyperintense or to demonstrate homogenous contrast enhancement.

In addition to the clinical and imaging findings, the patient's history of malignant hypertension is also a risk factor for venous malformations. Venous malformations are often associated with other congenital anomalies, such as Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome, which is characterized by venous malformations, limb hypertrophy, and varicosities.

The treatment of venous malformations is typically with surgical excision. However, in some cases, sclerotherapy or embolization may be used.

The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of bilateral sixth nerve palsy. Sixth nerve palsy can be caused by a variety of conditions, including infection, inflammation, trauma, tumor, and stroke. In children, the most common cause of sixth nerve palsy is a migraine headache.

In this case, the patient's history of upper respiratory tract infection and recent diagnosis of migraines suggests that her sixth nerve palsy may be caused by a migraine. However, it is important to rule out other possible causes, such as a brain tumor or stroke. Therefore, the best course of action is to refer the patient to a neurologist for further evaluation.

A: Continue oral antibiotics is incorrect because the patient's sixth nerve palsy is not likely caused by an infection.

C: Continue neuroimaging is incorrect because the patient's sixth nerve palsy is not likely caused by a tumor or stroke.

The patient presented with rapid loss of vision with the onset of a white ring surrounding the optic nerve. The history, physical examination, and imaging findings are consistent with serpiginous choroiditis, which is a chronic, recurrent, inflammatory disease of the choroid. Serpiginous choroiditis is most commonly seen in patients with HLA-B27, and it is often associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as ankylosing spondylitis and inflammatory bowel disease. The treatment of serpiginous choroiditis is with corticosteroids, such as oral prednisone. Other treatment options include immunosuppressive agents, such as azathioprine or cyclosporine.

The other options are incorrect because they are not the appropriate treatment for serpiginous choroiditis. B.

Explanation:

The patient's presentation is consistent with a diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis, a systemic vasculitis that can affect the lungs, kidneys, and other organs. One of the characteristic features of Wegener's granulomatosis is the presence of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs) in the blood. ANCAs are antibodies that target proteins in the cytoplasm of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell.

ANCA testing is the most sensitive and specific test for Wegener's granulomatosis. If ANCAs are positive, further testing, such as a biopsy, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

Quantiferon gold is a test for tuberculosis infection. Rapid plasma reagin (RPR) is a test for syphilis. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) level is a test for sarcoidosis. These tests are not typically used to diagnose Wegener's granulomatosis.

The patient in the case has a history of personality changes, headache, and decreased vision bilaterally. She also has hearing loss and vertigo. Her white blood cell count is elevated, and her magnetic resonance imaging of the brain reveals multifocal punctate areas of restricted diffusion. A lumbar puncture shows lymphocytosis (80%), normal glucose levels, and protein levels greater than 125 mg/dL. Results from cerebrospinal fluid polymerase chain reaction are negative for herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, and cytomegalovirus. Results from laboratory tests for hypercoagulable states, antinucleolar antibodies, antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies, human immunodeficiency virus, Lyme disease, and tuberculosis are unrevealing.

The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with Susac syndrome, a rare disorder that affects the brain, inner ear, and retina. The typical presentation of Susac syndrome is a triad of encephalopathy, hearing loss, and vision loss. The encephalopathy can manifest as personality changes, headache, seizures, and ataxia. The hearing loss is usually bilateral and sensorineural. The vision loss is usually bilateral and can affect both the central and peripheral visual fields.

The diagnosis of Susac syndrome is based on the clinical presentation and the results of laboratory tests and imaging studies. There is no specific treatment for Susac syndrome, but corticosteroids are often used to treat the encephalopathy and hearing loss. Immunosuppression may also be used to prevent further damage to the brain, inner ear, and retina.

In the case presented, the patient's clinical presentation is consistent with Susac syndrome. The results of her laboratory tests and imaging studies are also consistent with the diagnosis. Therefore, the most appropriate treatment for this patient is to administer systemic steroids and discuss the potential need for long-term immunosuppression.

The other options are incorrect because they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Option A is incorrect because dimethyl fumarate is a treatment for relapsing multiple sclerosis, which is not the diagnosis in this case. Option C is incorrect because intravenous acyclovir and intravitreal foscarnet are treatments for viral retinitis, which is also not the diagnosis in this case. Option D is incorrect because observing for acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy is not a treatment for Susac syndrome.

Explanation:

The patient was in a high-speed motor vehicle collision, which is a significant mechanism of injury for blunt abdominal trauma. He was hemodynamically stable on route to the hospital, but became hypotensive on arrival. This suggests that he may have had a significant intra-abdominal hemorrhage. The chest radiography showed marked elevation of the left hemidiaphragm. This is a sign of diaphragmatic rupture. The pelvic radiography revealed an unstable fracture involving bilateral pubic rami and the left sacroiliac joint. This is a significant injury that could cause significant blood loss. The patient was taken for emergent computed tomography, which showed a diaphragmatic rupture and a traumatic rupture of the descending thoracic aorta. The diaphragmatic rupture allowed abdominal contents to herniate into the chest, which would have caused the patient's hypotension. The traumatic rupture of the descending thoracic aorta would have caused the patient's chest pain and hemodynamic instability.

The other options are incorrect because they do not explain all of the patient's clinical findings.

* Option A, diaphragmatic eventration with lung collapse, does not explain the patient's hypotension.
* Option B, pneumothorax with elevation of the left hemidiaphragm, does not explain the patient's chest pain.

 62%|██████▏   | 939/1525 [3:34:56<2:07:50, 13.09s/it]The answer is D: Rectosigmoid leiomyoma.

A sigmoid adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer that starts in the colon. It is the most common type of colorectal cancer. The symptoms of sigmoid adenocarcinoma can include lower abdominal pain, rectal bleeding, and a change in bowel habits. The diagnosis of sigmoid adenocarcinoma is usually made with a colonoscopy. Treatment for sigmoid adenocarcinoma may include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.

A rectosigmoid polyp is a growth that can develop on the inner lining of the rectum or sigmoid colon. Polyps can be either benign (not cancerous) or malignant (cancerous). The symptoms of a rectosigmoid polyp can include rectal bleeding, a change in bowel habits, and abdominal pain. The diagnosis of a rectosigmoid polyp is usually made with a colonoscopy. Treatment for a rectosigmoid polyp may include removal of the polyp with a scope or surgery.

Endometriosis is a condition in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus. This tissue can grow in the ovaries, fallopian tubes, bladder, bowel, or other areas of the body. The symptoms of endometriosis can include severe menstrual cramps, pain during intercourse, infertility, and heavy menstrual bleeding. The diagnosis of endometriosis is usually made with a laparoscopy. Treatment for endometriosis may include medication, surgery, or a combination of both.

A leiomyoma is a type of tumor that can grow in the smooth muscle tissue of the body. Leiomyomas are most commonly found in the uterus, but they can also occur in the bowel. The symptoms of a leiomyoma can vary depending on the size and location of the tumor. Some people with leiomyomas may have no symptoms, while others may experience pain, bleeding, or constipation. The diagnosis of a leiomyoma is usually made with imaging tests, such as an ultrasound or MRI. Treatment for a leiomyoma may include medication, surgery, or observation.

In the case of the 45-year-old woman with factor 1 deficiency, the most likely diagnosis is a rectosigmoid leiomyoma. This is because leiomyomas are the most common type of tumor that can grow in the smooth muscle tissue of the bowel. Additionally, the woman's history of multiple episodes of lower gastrointestinal bleeding, which is associated with crampy abdominal pain, is consistent with the symptoms of a leiomyoma. The fact that the woman's previous abdominal surgery included a hysterectomy for menorrhagia suggests that she may be at increased risk for developing leiomyomas. Finally, the computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis shows eccentric and irregular masslike thickening of the sigmoid colon, which is also consistent with the diagnosis of a leiomyoma.

While it is possible that the woman could have a sigmoid adenocarcinoma, rectosigmoid polyp, or sigmoid endometriosis, these diagnoses are less likely given the woman's history and physical examination findings. Sigmoid adenocarcinoma is the most common type of colorectal cancer, but it is typically diagnosed in older adults. Rectosigmoid polyps are growths that can develop on the inner lining of the rectum or sigmoid colon, but they are usually benign (not cancerous). Sigmoid endometriosis is a condition in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus, but it is typically diagnosed in women of reproductive age.

Explanation:

The patient is a 56-year-old woman with metastatic melanoma receiving ipilimumab and nivolumab every 3 weeks. She developed headaches during the course of her treatment. The headaches are daily, vary in location, and are not associated with eye or temple pain. The patient also reports low energy levels and difficulty reading. Physical examination shows no gross visual field defects. Laboratory workup shows elevated ACTH and cortisol levels, decreased TSH level, and normal sodium level. Contrast-enhanced MRI of the brain shows a sellar mass with no evidence of brain metastasis.

The most likely diagnosis is immune-related hypophysitis. This is a rare but well-recognized complication of immunotherapy, particularly checkpoint inhibitors such as ipilimumab and nivolumab. The pathophysiology of immune-related hypophysitis is thought to be immune-mediated destruction of the pituitary gland. The clinical presentation of immune-related hypophysitis can vary depending on the degree of pituitary dysfunction. Patients may present with headache, fatigue, visual changes, or symptoms of hypopituitarism such as weight loss, weakness, and cold intolerance. The diagnosis of immune-related hypophysitis is made with MRI of the brain and laboratory testing to assess pituitary function. Treatment of immune-related hypophysitis is with corticosteroids. In most cases, the symptoms of immune-related hypophysitis improve with treatment. However, some patients may have persistent or permanent hypopituitarism.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely. Brain metastasis is unlikely given the patient's history and presentation. Pituitary adenoma is a rare tumor that can cause headaches, but it is not typically associated with immune-related hypophysitis. Mucocele is a benign tumor that can arise in the sella turcica, but it is not typically associated with immune-related hypophysitis.

In this case, the patient has been taking a nutritional supplement that contains high levels of beta carotene. The physical examination reveals yellow-orange pigmentation of the palms and soles, and laboratory tests are normal. These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of carotenemia.

The next step in management is to advise the patient to discontinue the nutritional supplement. The pigmentation should resolve within a few weeks. If the pigmentation does not resolve, or if it is accompanied by other symptoms, further evaluation is warranted.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. A biopsy is not necessary to diagnose carotenemia, and it would not be helpful in managing the condition. Repeat liver function tests are not necessary, as the patient's liver function tests are already normal. Empirical treatment with a topical steroid is not indicated, as carotenemia is a benign condition that does not require treatment.

The patient has multiple myeloma, a plasma cell neoplasm characterized by the production of a monoclonal protein, which in this case is an IgG κ protein. The bone marrow biopsy shows a normocellular bone marrow with 10% κ-restricted plasma cells, which is consistent with the diagnosis of multiple myeloma. The patient is also anuric, which is a common complication of multiple myeloma.

The mainstay of treatment for multiple myeloma is chemotherapy, with the goal of reducing the tumor burden and improving renal function. Bortezomib-dexamethasone–based therapy is a standard first-line treatment for multiple myeloma. It is a combination of two drugs, bortezomib and dexamethasone. Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor, which kills cancer cells by interfering with their ability to break down proteins. Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid, which has anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects.

The other options are incorrect because they are not the standard treatment for multiple myeloma. Option A, continue IV fluids and administer furosemide, is not a definitive treatment for multiple myeloma. Furosemide is a diuretic, which can be used to reduce fluid overload in patients with multiple myeloma, but it does not treat the underlying disease. Option C, obtain renal biopsy, is not necessary in this case, as the diagnosis of multiple myeloma is already established. Option D, order skeletal survey, is not necessary in this case, as the bone marrow biopsy has already shown the presence of multiple myeloma.

In conclusion, the correct answer is: B. Initiate bortezomib-dexamethasone–based therapy.

Artemether-lumefantrine is a combination drug that is used to treat malaria. It is the first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in adults and children. It is also effective against resistant strains of malaria.

Chloroquine is another drug that is used to treat malaria. However, it is not effective against all strains of malaria. In addition, it can cause serious side effects, such as retinopathy.

Intravenous quinidine gluconate and doxycycline are used to treat severe malaria. However, they are not the first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria.

Exchange transfusion is a procedure that is used to remove red blood cells from the blood. It is used to treat severe malaria that is not responding to treatment.

In this case, the patient has a history of travel to Sierra Leone, where malaria is endemic. He has fever, fatigue, and jaundice, which are all symptoms of malaria. The thin preparation blood smear shows malaria parasites. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is malaria. The first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria is artemether-lumefantrine.

Elastolytic granuloma is a rare, benign, inflammatory skin disease that is characterized by the accumulation of foamy histiocytes and the destruction of elastic fibers. It is most commonly seen in middle-aged women, and it typically affects the lower extremities. The lesions are usually multiple, small, and erythematous papules or nodules. There is no specific treatment for elastolytic granuloma, and the lesions usually resolve spontaneously within a few months to a year.

Epithelioid sarcoma is a rare, malignant neoplasm of the soft tissues that is characterized by the presence of epithelioid cells. It most commonly affects young adults, and it typically presents as a painless, solitary nodule on the extremities. The lesions can be locally aggressive, and they have a high risk of metastasis. The treatment for epithelioid sarcoma is surgical excision, and adjuvant chemotherapy may be used in some cases.

Storiform collagenoma is a rare, benign, cutaneous neoplasm that is characterized by the proliferation of storiform collagen bundles. It is most commonly seen in middle-aged adults, and it typically affects the trunk and extremities. The lesions are usually solitary, small, and asymptomatic papules or nodules. There is no specific treatment for storiform collagenoma, and the lesions usually resolve spontaneously within a few months to a year.

In the case presented, the patient is a healthy man in his 20s who presented with a several-month history of asymptomatic, slightly erythematous cutaneous nodules, measuring 1.5 to 3.0 cm, over the calcanea. Physical examination revealed violaceous plaques, measuring 2 to 3 cm, on the extensor surface of the knees, bilaterally. Excisional biopsy specimens were obtained, and the histopathologic findings were consistent with knee-located erythema elevatum diutinum (EED) with a calcaneal late-stage nodular component.

EED is a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory skin disease that is characterized by the development of violaceous papules and plaques on the extensor surfaces of the extremities. The lesions are usually pruritic, and they may be associated with arthralgias and myalgias. The etiology of EED is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder. The treatment for EED is typically with topical corticosteroids, and systemic corticosteroids may be used in severe cases.

In the case presented, the patient's clinical presentation and histopathologic findings are consistent with EED. The patient's age, sex, and location of the lesions are also consistent with EED. The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not fit the patient's clinical presentation or histopathologic findings.

Explanation:

Pemphigoid gestationis (PG) is an autoimmune blistering disorder that occurs during pregnancy or the postpartum period. It is characterized by the appearance of tense blisters on the abdomen, breasts, and extremities. The diagnosis of PG is based on the clinical presentation and histopathologic findings. Treatment is with corticosteroids, which can be given orally or topically.

The patient in the case presented with an acute, painful eruption on her face and neck. She had a history of Darier disease, which is a hereditary skin disorder characterized by warty papules and plaques. Darier disease is not associated with an increased risk of PG. The patient's eruption was not consistent with impetigo, which is a superficial bacterial infection of the skin. Impetigo is characterized by small, superficial blisters that rupture easily and form honey-colored crusts. The patient's eruption was also not consistent with Kaposi varicelliform eruption, which is a disseminated herpesvirus infection that occurs in immunocompromised patients. Kaposi varicelliform eruption is characterized by widespread, painful vesicles and bullae. The patient's eruption was also not consistent with impetigo herpetiformis, which is a rare, autoimmune blistering disorder that occurs in children. Impetigo herpetiformis is characterized by widespread, painful vesicles and bullae that are associated with a high fever.

The patient's eruption was most consistent with PG. PG is a rare, autoimmune blistering disorder that occurs during pregnancy or the postpartum period.

Explanation:

The patient presents with a number of symptoms consistent with PTSD, including intrusive thoughts and memories, avoidance of reminders of the trauma, negative changes in mood and cognition, and increased arousal. Trauma-focused psychotherapy is a type of psychotherapy that has been shown to be effective in treating PTSD. It involves helping the patient to confront and process the traumatic memories in a safe and supportive environment. This can be a difficult process, but it can lead to significant improvement in symptoms.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Risperidone is an antipsychotic medication that is not typically used to treat PTSD. It may be used to treat symptoms of psychosis that are associated with PTSD, but it is not a first-line treatment.
* Prazosin is an alpha-blocker medication that has been shown to be effective in reducing nightmares in people with PTSD. However, it is not as effective as trauma-focused psychotherapy in treating other symptoms of PTSD.
* Propranolol is a beta-blocker medication that is used to treat high blood pressure and heart problems. It has not been shown to be effective in treating PTSD.

In conclusion, the best treatment for the patient is trauma-focused psychotherapy. This type of therapy has been shown to be effective in treating PTSD and can lead to significant improvement in symptoms.

Explanation:

The patient in this case presented with a number of symptoms that are consistent with primary adrenal insufficiency, including:

* Weight loss
* Postural lightheadedness
* Fatigue
* Muscle weakness
* Salt cravings
* Loss of axillary hair
* Missed periods
* Hyperpigmentation of the knuckles, distal fingers, and tongue

These symptoms are caused by a deficiency of the hormone cortisol, which is produced by the adrenal glands. Cortisol helps to regulate blood sugar, blood pressure, and the immune system. When cortisol levels are low, the body is unable to function properly and a number of symptoms can develop.

The diagnosis of primary adrenal insufficiency is confirmed by blood tests that measure cortisol levels. Treatment involves taking replacement doses of cortisol, which can be taken orally or by injection. With treatment, most people with primary adrenal insufficiency can live normal, active lives.

The other possible diagnoses listed in the question are not consistent with the patient's symptoms. Hypervitaminosis A is a condition that can cause a number of symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, headache, and blurred vision. However, it does not cause weight loss, postural lightheadedness, fatigue, muscle weakness, salt cravings, loss of axillary hair, or missed periods.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is a condition that causes symptoms such as lightheadedness, dizziness, and fainting when standing up. However, it does not cause weight loss, fatigue, muscle weakness, salt cravings, loss of axillary hair, or missed periods.

Anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder that can cause weight loss, fatigue, and muscle weakness. However, it does not cause postural lightheadedness, salt cravings, loss of axillary hair, or missed periods.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for the patient in this case is primary adrenal insufficiency.

Explanation:

The patient is a 32-year-old woman with a history of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) who presented for evaluation of her congenital heart disease. Surgical history consisted of a Blalock-Taussig shunt in early childhood and subsequent TOF repair at age 3 years. On examination, venous pressure was visualized 4 cm above the clavicle at 45° with a prominent a wave. A parasternal lift was present. Auscultatory findings at the left upper sternal border are provided in the corresponding Audio. An electrocardiogram (Figure 1A) revealed sinus rhythm with a right bundle branch block. Findings from a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) are shown in Figure 1B and Video 1. Right ventricular diastolic volume index, quantitated by cardiac magnetic resonance, was 161 mL/m2.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with severe pulmonary regurgitation. The electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm with a right bundle branch block, which is a non-specific finding. The TTE shows severe pulmonary regurgitation with an estimated pulmonary regurgitant fraction of 50%. The right ventricular diastolic volume index is elevated, which is consistent with right ventricular volume overload.

The treatment for severe pulmonary regurgitation is pulmonary valve replacement. The goal of surgery is to relieve the symptoms of right ventricular volume overload and to prevent the development of right heart failure. The patient should be referred to a cardiac surgeon for further evaluation and management.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Sildenafil is a phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor that is used to treat erectile dysfunction. It is not indicated for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension.
* Balloon valvotomy is a minimally invasive procedure that is used to treat pulmonary stenosis. It is not indicated for the treatment of pulmonary regurgitation.
* Surgical intervention for residual ventricular septal defect is indicated for patients with symptomatic residual ventricular septal defects. The patient in this case does not have any symptoms of a residual ventricular septal defect.

Atypical carcinoids are rare neuroendocrine tumors that typically arise in the gastrointestinal tract. They are often slow-growing and may not cause symptoms for many years. However, atypical carcinoids can eventually spread to other parts of the body, such as the liver and lungs.

The patient in this case presents with a slowly growing right-sided neck mass with progressive dysphagia. This is consistent with the clinical presentation of atypical carcinoid. The CT scan shows a heterogeneously enhancing mass in the right side of the neck, splaying and completely surrounding both the internal and external carotid arteries. This is also consistent with the imaging findings of atypical carcinoid. The MRI shows a hyperintense mass on T2, which is also consistent with atypical carcinoid.

The patient underwent excision of the mass with right-sided neck dissection. The mass was found to be a neuroendocrine tumor, which is consistent with the diagnosis of atypical carcinoid. The tumor was also positive for chromogranin A and synaptophysin, which are two markers that are often positive in neuroendocrine tumors.

The patient's postoperative course was uneventful. He did not experience any neurologic sequelae. This is consistent with the good prognosis of atypical carcinoid, which is typically a slow-growing tumor with a good response to treatment.

The other possible diagnoses are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Malignant carotid body tumor is a rare neuroendocrine tumor that typically arises in the carotid body. It is often aggressive and may spread to other parts of the body quickly. The patient in this case does not have any features that are consistent with malignant carotid body tumor, such as rapid growth or metastasis.
* Medullary thyroid carcinoma is a rare neuroendocrine tumor that arises from the thyroid gland. It is often associated with the MEN2 syndrome. The patient in this case does not have any features that are consistent with medullary thyroid carcinoma, such as a family history of MEN2 or a thyroid nodule.
* Hemangiopericytoma is a rare soft tissue tumor that typically arises in the extremities. It is often benign but can be malignant. The patient in this case does not have any features that are consistent with hemangiopericytoma, such as a soft tissue mass in the extremities.

A nasal chondromesenchymal hamartoma is a rare, benign, non-neoplastic lesion of the nasal cavity. It is composed of cartilage, bone, and mesenchymal tissue. It is thought to arise from abnormal differentiation of mesenchymal cells during embryogenesis.

Nasal chondromesenchymal hamartomas typically present in children or young adults with nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and facial asymmetry. On physical examination, a polypoid or pedunculated mass is often seen in the nasal cavity. Radiographs may show a well-circumscribed mass with calcifications.

The treatment of nasal chondromesenchymal hamartoma is surgical excision. The prognosis is excellent with complete excision.

The other options are incorrect. Intranasal glioma is a rare, malignant tumor of the brain that arises from glial cells. Basal encephalocele is a congenital defect in the skull base that allows protrusion of brain tissue into the nasal cavity.

Explanation:

The patient in this case presented with a progressive sore throat, globus sensation, and dysphagia. She was prescribed multiple rounds of antibiotics without notable improvement. Physical examination revealed a submucosal right retropharyngeal mass extending from the level of the soft palate to the postcricoid. Cranial nerve function and neck range of motion were normal. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a 4 × 3 × 3-cm right retropharyngeal mass with narrowing of the pharyngeal airway, subtle permeative destruction and cortical breakthrough of the C2 vertebral body. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast showed a T2 hyperintense, enhancing mass in the retropharyngeal and prevertebral spaces with marrow replacement of the C2 vertebral body extending to the odontoid. The patient underwent a combined otolaryngology-neurosurgical procedure with a transoral approach via an inferiorly based myomucosal flap to C1-C3 with microsurgical resection of C2 tumor and corpectomy, placement of the halo device, tracheotomy, and staged interval occiput-C6 posterior spinal fusion. Her postoperative course was uneventful, and she was decannulated prior to hospital discharge. Histopathologic findings showed sheets and cords of tumor cells with eosinophilic granular, clear, or bubbly cytoplasm on a basophilic myxoid stromal background, and scattered physaliphorous cells were also noted. Results from immunohistochemical analysis were positive for brachyury.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, imaging findings, and histopathologic and immunohistochemical findings, the most likely diagnosis is chordoma. Chordomas are rare, slow-growing tumors that arise from remnants of the notochord. They most commonly occur in the sacrococcygeal region, followed by the clivus and base of the skull. Chordomas are typically locally invasive but rarely metastasize. The treatment of chordoma is surgical resection, with or without adjuvant radiation therapy.

The other options are incorrect. Carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma is a type of salivary gland carcinoma that arises from a pre-existing pleomorphic adenoma. Chordoid meningioma is a type of meningioma that has a chordoma-like appearance. Chondrosarcoma is a type of bone cancer that arises from cartilage.

Ewing sarcoma is a malignant bone tumor that typically occurs in adolescents and young adults. It is characterized by a rapidly growing mass that is often associated with pain, swelling, and fever. Ewing sarcoma is usually diagnosed by biopsy and confirmed with imaging studies, such as MRI or CT scan. Treatment typically involves a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

Eosinophilic granuloma is a benign condition that is characterized by a collection of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, in the bone. It is most commonly seen in children and young adults. Eosinophilic granuloma is usually diagnosed by biopsy and confirmed with imaging studies, such as MRI or CT scan. Treatment typically involves a short course of steroids.

Desmoid tumor is a rare, slow-growing tumor that is made up of fibroblasts, a type of cell that produces collagen. It can occur anywhere in the body, but is most common in the abdomen, chest, and back. Desmoid tumors are usually benign, but can be locally aggressive. Treatment typically involves surgery, but radiation therapy and chemotherapy may also be used.

Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymph system, which is a network of organs and tissues that help the body fight infection. There are many different types of lymphoma, but they are all characterized by the abnormal growth of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. Lymphoma can occur at any age, but is most common in adults over the age of 60. Treatment depends on the type and stage of lymphoma, but may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or bone marrow transplantation.

In the case of the 2-year-old boy with a unilateral neck swelling, the most likely diagnosis is desmoid tumor. This is supported by the following findings:

* The mass is firm, immobile, and nontender, which is consistent with a desmoid tumor.
* The mass is affixed to the underlying right mandible, which suggests that it is arising from the bone.
* The mass is heterogeneously hyperintense with internal foci of decreased intensity on T2 sequence, which is a characteristic finding of desmoid tumors.
* The mass is positive for β-catenin, which is a marker that is often expressed in desmoid tumors.
* The mass is negative for CD34, desmin, and smooth muscle actin, which are markers that are typically expressed in other types of soft tissue tumors.
* The patient is negative for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) mutations on genetic testing, which rules out Gardner syndrome, a genetic condition that is associated with an increased risk of desmoid tumors.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely based on the information that is provided. Ewing sarcoma is typically seen in adolescents and young adults, and it is not usually associated with a firm, immobile mass. Eosinophilic granuloma is a benign condition that is typically seen in children and young adults, and it is not usually associated with a heterogeneously hyperintense mass on T2 sequence. Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymph system, and it is not typically associated with a mass that is affixed to the underlying bone.

The patient has a strong family history of bilateral ptosis, which is suggestive of an inherited condition. The most common cause of inherited ptosis is myogenic ptosis, which is caused by a defect in the levator palpebrae superioris muscle. Ptosis repair by Müllerectomy or levator advancement is the most appropriate treatment for myogenic ptosis.

Genetic testing for GCG triplet repeats is not necessary in this case, as the patient's family history is highly suggestive of an inherited condition.

The patient in this case has multiple shallow serous retinal detachments, which are a known complication of optic disc inflammation. Prednisone is a corticosteroid that has anti-inflammatory properties and is often used to treat this condition. The dose of prednisone is typically started at 80 mg daily and then tapered over time.

Surgical decompression of vortex veins is not indicated in this case because there is no evidence of increased intracranial pressure. B-scan ultrasonography is a non-invasive imaging test that can be used to assess the optic nerve and retina, but it is not necessary in this case because the diagnosis is already clear. Checking blood pressure is important in all patients, but it is not the most important management step in this case.

In addition to starting prednisone, the patient should also be advised to avoid activities that could increase the risk of retinal detachment, such as straining, lifting heavy objects, and bending over. He should also be instructed to report any changes in vision, such as a sudden loss of vision or a decrease in peripheral vision, to his doctor immediately.

Explanation:
A complete blood cell count (CBC) is a blood test that checks the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets in the blood. It can be used to diagnose a variety of conditions, including anemia, infection, and inflammation.

In the case of a young man with bilateral branch retinal vein occlusions, a CBC is important to rule out any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to the occlusions. For example, anemia can cause blood to thicken, which can make it more likely for veins to become occluded. Infection or inflammation can also damage the blood vessels, which can lead to occlusions.

If a CBC is normal, it does not necessarily mean that the retinal vein occlusions are not caused by an underlying medical condition. However, it can help to narrow down the possible causes and guide further testing.

A: Obtain an infectious and inflammatory panel is not the correct answer because this test is not typically used to diagnose retinal vein occlusions. Infectious and inflammatory conditions can cause retinal vein occlusions, but they are not the most common causes. A CBC is more likely to identify an underlying medical condition that is contributing to the occlusions.

B: Observe is not the correct answer because it is important to rule out any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to the retinal vein occlusions. A CBC can help to do this.

D: Inject an anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) is not the correct answer because this treatment is not typically used for retinal vein occlusions in young people. Anti-VEGF injections are more commonly used for people with age-related macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy.

Explanation:

The patient has a history of breast cancer with brain metastasis treated with CyberKnife and whole-brain radiation. She also has glaucoma and received 2 inferiorly placed periocular steroid injections while abroad. She now presents with 3 months of constant blurry vision in the left eye, a left afferent pupillary defect, left superior visual field deficit, 2+ whitish vitreous deposits, a cup-disc ratio of 0.8, and inferior retinal detachment with subretinal particulate material. B-scan shows vitreous, subhyaloid, and subretinal opacities without choroidal involvement. A magnetic resonance image of the brain and orbits did not reveal any new metastatic lesions.

The most likely diagnosis is radiation-induced retinal detachment. Radiation therapy can cause damage to the retina, leading to retinal detachment. The vitreous deposits are likely due to the presence of subretinal fluid. The cup-disc ratio of 0.8 is suggestive of glaucoma. The left afferent pupillary defect and left superior visual field deficit are consistent with retinal detachment. The B-scan shows vitreous, subhyaloid, and subretinal opacities without choroidal involvement, which is consistent with radiation-induced retinal detachment. The magnetic resonance image of the brain and orbits did not reveal any new metastatic lesions, which makes metastatic disease less likely.

The treatment for radiation-induced retinal detachment is vitrectomy. Vitrectomy is a surgical procedure that removes the vitreous humor, the jelly-like substance that fills the inside of the eye. This allows the retina to reattach to the back of the eye. Vitrectomy is the most effective treatment for radiation-induced retinal detachment.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Biopsy is not necessary because the diagnosis is already clear. Observe and manage glaucoma is not appropriate because the patient has retinal detachment, which is a more serious condition than glaucoma. Enucleate is not appropriate because the patient has a treatable condition, retinal detachment.

Acute cholecystitis is a common inflammatory condition of the gallbladder. It is caused by obstruction of the cystic duct by a gallstone, which leads to inflammation and infection of the gallbladder wall.

Intramural perforation is a rare complication of acute cholecystitis. It occurs when the inflammatory process erodes through the wall of the gallbladder, allowing bile to leak into the surrounding tissues. Intrahepatic perforation is a subtype of intramural perforation in which the bile leaks into the liver parenchyma.

The patient in this case presents with a history of right upper abdominal pain, fever, and chills. The physical examination reveals guarding and tenderness in the right upper quadrant. Laboratory investigations are remarkable for leukocytosis and elevated alkaline phosphatase. The imaging studies show a large hypodense area in the right lobe of the liver along with gallstones. These findings are consistent with acute cholecystitis with intrahepatic perforation of the gallbladder.

The other options are incorrect. Liver abscess is a collection of pus in the liver that can be caused by a variety of infections, including pyogenic bacteria, amebae, and fungi. Gallbladder cancer is a malignant neoplasm of the gallbladder that is most commonly diagnosed in the elderly.

Explanation:

The most likely diagnosis is a cecal diverticulum. This is supported by the patient's history of an asymptomatic cystic lesion in the right iliac fossa, which is a common location for cecal diverticula. The lesion is also described as being cystic, which is consistent with a cecal diverticulum. In addition, the patient's general physical and abdominal examinations were unremarkable, and the results of other investigations such as a hemogram, liver and kidney function tests, and serum tumor markers, including serum carcinoembryonic antigen levels, were within the prescribed normal range. This suggests that the lesion is not malignant.

Mucocele of the appendix is a less likely diagnosis. This is because mucoceles of the appendix are usually associated with symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. In addition, mucoceles of the appendix are often larger than 16 mm.

Meckel diverticulum is also a less likely diagnosis. This is because Meckel diverticula are usually located in the distal ileum, not the cecum. In addition, Meckel diverticula are often associated with symptoms such as abdominal pain, bleeding, and intussusception.

Ileal duplication cyst is a very unlikely diagnosis. This is because ileal duplication cysts are rare, and they are usually located in the distal ileum, not the cecum. In addition, ileal duplication cysts are often associated with symptoms such as abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea.

It is characterized by a solid and cystic appearance on imaging studies, and is often associated with ascites and splenomegaly. The diagnosis is made on the basis of histopathologic findings, which show a proliferation of cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and a characteristic pseudopapillary architecture. SPNPs are typically slow-growing tumors that have a good prognosis. Treatment is usually surgical resection, but in some cases, conservative management may be appropriate.

Atypical mucinous cystic neoplasm of the pancreas (ACC) is a rare, malignant neoplasm that occurs most commonly in older women. It is characterized by a cystic appearance on imaging studies, and is often associated with elevated levels of CA19-9. The diagnosis is made on the basis of histopathologic findings, which show a proliferation of mucin-producing cells with atypia. ACCs are typically aggressive tumors that have a poor prognosis. Treatment is usually surgical resection, but in some cases, chemotherapy may be indicated.

Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a rare, mesenchymal neoplasm that can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract. It is characterized by a proliferation of spindle cells that express CD117. The diagnosis is made on the basis of histopathologic findings. GISTs are typically slow-growing tumors that have a good prognosis. Treatment is usually surgical resection, but in some cases, chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be indicated.

Pancreatic pseudocyst is a fluid-filled collection that forms in the pancreas after acute pancreatitis. It is characterized by a smooth, round appearance on imaging studies. The diagnosis is made on the basis of clinical and imaging findings. Pancreatic pseudocysts are typically benign and resolve spontaneously over time. However, in some cases, they may require drainage or surgical intervention.

In this case, the patient is a young woman with a large, heterogeneous cystic mass in the pancreas. The mass is associated with ascites and splenomegaly. The patient's history and physical examination are not suggestive of any other underlying medical conditions. The imaging findings are consistent with a SPNP. The histopathologic findings show a proliferation of cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and a characteristic pseudopapillary architecture. These findings are diagnostic of SPNP.

The patient's age, gender, and clinical presentation are all consistent with a diagnosis of SPNP. The imaging findings are also consistent with this diagnosis. The histopathologic findings are diagnostic of SPNP. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is SPNP.

 63%|██████▎   | 962/1525 [3:40:19<2:09:38, 13.82s/it]The correct answer is: C. Start anticoagulation and refer the patient for surgical embolectomy.

The patient is a man with a 3-year history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who presented with increasing dyspnea on exertion, requiring increasing flow rates of oxygen. He was a former smoker with a 50-pack-year history. He had been diagnosed with stage I low-grade prostate cancer several years previously.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with pulmonary embolism (PE). The V/Q scan shows multiple mismatched perfusion defects, which is a classic finding in PE. The pulmonary angiography confirms the presence of a large PE in the left lower lobe.

The treatment for PE is anticoagulation with heparin followed by an oral anticoagulant, such as warfarin, for at least 6 months. In patients with massive PE, surgical embolectomy may be necessary.

In this case, the patient has a large PE that is causing significant dyspnea and hypoxemia. He is also at high risk for recurrent PE, as he has a history of COPD and a recent diagnosis of prostate cancer. Therefore, the best treatment option is to start anticoagulation with heparin followed by an oral anticoagulant for at least 6 months. The patient should also be referred for surgical embolectomy, as this may be necessary to improve his symptoms and prevent further complications.

The other options are not correct for the following reasons:

A. Start parenteral corticosteroids and nebulized bronchodilators. This would be the treatment for an exacerbation of COPD, but it is not the treatment for PE.

B. Start anticoagulation and refer the patient for evaluation for pulmonary thromboendarterectomy. Pulmonary thromboendarterectomy is a surgical procedure that is used to treat chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). CTEPH is a rare condition that occurs when chronic PE leads to the development of pulmonary hypertension. In this case, the patient does not have CTEPH, so pulmonary thromboendarterectomy would not be the appropriate treatment.

Explanation:

The patient's history of acute myeloid leukemia and allogeneic stem cell transplant, as well as the presence of biopsy-proven grade 3 cutaneous and grade 2 gastrointestinal graft-vs-host disease, are consistent with a diagnosis of graft-vs-host disease. The patient's recent history of fishing outdoors on a sunny day is also a risk factor for developing photosensitivity, which is a common complication of graft-vs-host disease. The physical examination findings of diffusely tan skin and flaccid bullae and erosions on the bilateral dorsal hands, elbows, and knees are also consistent with a diagnosis of graft-vs-host disease. The biopsy specimen from a bulla from the upper extremity shows features of graft-vs-host disease, including perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate, epidermal atrophy, and vacuolar degeneration of the basal layer of the epidermis.

Acquired epidermolysis bullosa is a rare, autoimmune disorder characterized by the formation of blisters in the skin and mucous membranes. It is not associated with a history of acute myeloid leukemia or allogeneic stem cell transplant.

Pseudoporphyria is a clinical syndrome characterized by skin blistering, photosensitivity, and abdominal pain. It is caused by the accumulation of porphyrins in the skin and is not associated with a history of acute myeloid leukemia or allogeneic stem cell transplant.

Explanation:
The patient is an African American male in his 50s with a longstanding history of atopic dermatitis who presents with a 20- to 30-year medical history of occasionally pruritic erythematous papules involving the trunk and extremities. He denied associated fevers, chills, night sweats, weight loss, joint pain, cough, difficulty breathing, or chest pain. Findings from the physical examination revealed red-brown monomorphic papules coalescing into plaques on the face, trunk, and extremities. There were thin erythematous plaques with overlying scale on bilateral extensor upper and lower extremities. A 4-mm punch biopsy specimen from his right upper extremity was obtained and stained with hematoxylin-eosin for histopathologic analysis. Periodic acid–Schiff and acid-fast bacilli stains were also performed.

The most likely diagnosis is disseminated granuloma annulare. This is a chronic, self-limited skin condition characterized by the formation of small, raised, red or brown papules that often coalesce into plaques. The papules are typically found on the trunk, extremities, and face, and they may be pruritic. The cause of disseminated granuloma annulare is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune condition. There is no specific treatment for disseminated granuloma annulare, but the condition often resolves on its own within a few months to a year. Treatment options that may be used to relieve symptoms include topical corticosteroids, oral antihistamines, and ultraviolet light therapy.

The other options are less likely diagnoses. Erythrodermic sarcoidosis is a rare, chronic inflammatory condition that can affect multiple organs, including the skin, lungs, eyes, and heart. The skin lesions of erythrodermic sarcoidosis are typically red, scaly plaques that may be pruritic or painful. Mycosis fungoides is a rare, slow-growing type of skin cancer that begins in the T cells of the immune system. The early lesions of mycosis fungoides are typically small, red, scaly patches that may be mistaken for eczema or psoriasis. Tuberculid is a group of skin conditions that are caused by an immune reaction to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium that causes tuberculosis. The skin lesions of tuberculid are typically red, raised bumps that may be pruritic or painful.

Explanation:
Cutaneous tuberculosis is a chronic granulomatous infection of the skin caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is the most common form of extrapulmonary tuberculosis, accounting for 10-15% of cases. The most common presentation is a single, painless papule or nodule that slowly enlarges over time. The lesion may be ulcerated and have a purulent discharge. Cutaneous tuberculosis can occur in people of all ages, but it is most common in people who are immunocompromised, such as those with HIV infection. The diagnosis of cutaneous tuberculosis is made by biopsy of the lesion. The treatment is with anti-tuberculosis medications.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Botryomycosis is a rare, chronic, pyogenic infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissues caused by the bacterium Actinomyces bovis. It is characterized by the formation of small, pus-filled nodules that may coalesce to form larger abscesses. The nodules are often painful and may drain a foul-smelling discharge. Botryomycosis is most commonly seen in men who work with animals, such as farmers and veterinarians. The diagnosis is made by biopsy of the lesion. The treatment is with antibiotics.
* Digital mucous cyst is a benign, non-infectious condition that occurs when a mucous gland in the finger or toe becomes blocked. It is characterized by the formation of a small, fluid-filled sac on the side of the finger or toe. The sac is usually painless, but it may be tender if it is squeezed. Digital mucous cysts are most common in adults and are more common in women than men. The diagnosis is made by clinical examination. The treatment is usually not necessary, but the cyst may be drained if it is painful or unsightly.
* Foreign-body reaction is a localized inflammatory response to a foreign material, such as a splinter or piece of glass. It is characterized by redness, swelling, and pain at the site of the foreign body. The foreign body may be visible on the skin or it may be embedded in the tissue. The diagnosis is made by clinical examination. The treatment is to remove the foreign body and to treat the inflammation with antibiotics if necessary.

Explanation:
The patient in the case study has a history of muscular weakness that has slowly increased since infancy. He first walked at age 18 months, but always had a waddling gait and hyperlordosis. He was examined at 3 neuromuscular centers, and his electromyography (EMG), creatine phosphokinase levels, muscle tomodensitometry, and 3 muscle biopsies were all normal. Results for acetylcholinesterase antibodies were also negative. At age 48 years, the patient had increasing axial and proximal weakness, hyperlordosis, and difficulties rising from the floor. He was only able to walk 181 m in a 6-minute walking test. Peripheral facial weakness and bilateral eyelid ptosis were prominent. Clinical history also included asthma with several episodes of decompensation. During these episodes, the patient received oral albuterol, 2.5 mg every 6 hours, and inhaled steroids, 250 µg twice a day. Surprisingly, during an asthma attack, the patient was able to climb the stairs, rise from the floor, and walk several kilometers. His neuromuscular condition resumed to the initial level of weakness some weeks after the asthma attack.

The patient's symptoms are most consistent with seronegative myasthenia gravis, a rare autoimmune disorder that affects the neuromuscular junction. In myasthenia gravis, the body's immune system attacks the acetylcholine receptors at the neuromuscular junction, preventing the muscles from receiving the signals they need to contract. This can lead to muscle weakness, which can vary in severity from person to person.

The patient's symptoms of muscular weakness that has slowly increased since infancy, waddling gait, hyperlordosis, facial weakness, and eyelid ptosis are all consistent with myasthenia gravis. The fact that his symptoms improved during an asthma attack is also consistent with myasthenia gravis, as asthma attacks can cause an increase in circulating levels of epinephrine, which can improve muscle strength in people with myasthenia gravis.

The patient's EMG, creatine phosphokinase levels, muscle tomodensitometry, and muscle biopsies were all normal, which rules out other possible causes of his symptoms, such as Pompe disease, spinal muscular atrophy, and Becker muscular dystrophy.

The patient's negative results for acetylcholinesterase antibodies are also consistent with myasthenia gravis, as the majority of people with myasthenia gravis do not have detectable levels of these antibodies.

In conclusion, the patient's symptoms, history, and laboratory findings are most consistent with seronegative myasthenia gravis.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is most consistent with hypothyroidism. She has short stature, obesity, dry skin, and nonpitting edema. She also has a family history of hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism is a common endocrine disorder that can cause a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, weight gain, hair loss, and cold intolerance. It can also cause problems with the bones, such as slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). SCFE is a condition that occurs when the head of the femur slips off the neck of the femur. It is most common in children and adolescents, and it is more common in boys than girls. The exact cause of SCFE is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Hypothyroidism is a risk factor for SCFE.

The other options are incorrect. Hyponatremia is a condition that occurs when the level of sodium in the blood is too low. It can cause symptoms such as headache, nausea, and vomiting. Diabetes mellitus is a condition that occurs when the body cannot properly regulate blood sugar levels. It can cause symptoms such as fatigue, excessive thirst, and frequent urination.

Explanation:
The patient in the case has a history of multiple sclerosis and no traditional atherosclerosis risk factors. She presented to the emergency department with chest pain and a mildly elevated troponin level. Her ECG showed extensive T-wave inversions and mild inferolateral ST elevation. An emergency transthoracic echocardiogram showed systolic apical akinesis or ballooning. These findings are consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy, a stress-induced cardiomyopathy that is typically seen in women.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the best test to confirm the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. MRI can show the characteristic apical ballooning of the left ventricle and can also help to rule out other causes of chest pain, such as myocarditis or ischemia.

Coronary angiography is not necessary to diagnose Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. In fact, coronary angiography is often normal in patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. Coronary angiography may be performed to rule out other causes of chest pain, such as coronary artery disease.

Computed tomographic coronary angiography (CT angiography) is a newer test that can be used to visualize the coronary arteries. CT angiography is not necessary to diagnose Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. In fact, CT angiography may be normal in patients with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. CT angiography may be performed to rule out other causes of chest pain, such as coronary artery disease.

Therefore, the best test to confirm the diagnosis of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy in this patient is magnetic resonance imaging.

Explanation:

The patient presented with a lobular mass extending from the inferior pole of the right tonsil. The mass was smooth, pedunculated, and flesh-colored. It had enlarged since the prior examination. Both tonsils were removed without complication. The right tonsil with the attached mass was submitted to the pathology service fresh to allow evaluation by flow cytometry. Flow cytometry revealed no lymphoid abnormality. Grossly, the polypoid oval mass measured 2 × 1 × 1 cm, weighed 8.7 g, and had a narrow 0.4-cm-long stalk connecting it to the tonsil. Histologic sections revealed a polypoid structure composed of a fibrovascular core covered by stratified squamous epithelium. A subepithelial band of lymphoid tissue was noted as well as lymphatic channels accentuated by D2-40 antibody. No cellular atypia was identified.

The differential diagnosis for a polypoid mass arising from the tonsil includes:

* Fibroepithelial polyp
* Lymphangioma
* Lymphangiomatous polyp
* Juvenile angiofibroma

Fibroepithelial polyps are the most common type of benign tumor of the tonsil. They are typically small, pedunculated, and asymptomatic. Histologically, they are composed of a fibrovascular core covered by stratified squamous epithelium. Lymphangiomas are benign tumors of lymphatic tissue. They can be cystic or solid, and can occur anywhere in the body. Histologically, they are composed of dilated lymphatic channels. Lymphangiomatous polyps are a subtype of lymphangioma that arises from the tonsil. They are typically small, pedunculated, and asymptomatic. Histologically, they are composed of dilated lymphatic channels. Juvenile angiofibromas are rare, benign tumors of the nasopharynx. They typically occur in adolescent males. Histologically, they are composed of a mixture of vascular and fibrous tissue.

The patient in this case presented with a small, pedunculated, asymptomatic mass arising from the tonsil. The mass was histologically consistent with a fibroepithelial polyp. The other options in the differential diagnosis are less likely based on the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging studies.

Explanation:

The most likely diagnosis is solitary cutaneous myxoma, a rare benign tumor of mesenchymal origin. It is typically found in the skin, but can also occur in other soft tissues. Solitary cutaneous myxomas are usually solitary lesions, but can occur in multiple. They are typically small, measuring less than 2 cm in diameter. They are often described as being soft, gelatinous, and glistening. Histologically, solitary cutaneous myxomas are composed of bland spindle cells in a myxoid matrix. They are typically not associated with any symptoms, but can occasionally cause pain or discomfort. Treatment is typically surgical excision.

Epidermoid cysts and dermoid cysts are both benign tumors that can occur in the skin. However, they are not typically found on the posterior surface of the auricle. Chondromas are benign tumors of cartilage. They are not typically found in the skin, and are not associated with the clinical presentation described in the case.

The clinical presentation, imaging findings, and histopathological findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of solitary cutaneous myxoma.

Explanation:
The patient is a young man with hypercalcemia and an elevated parathyroid hormone level. The technetium Tc 99m sestamibi single-photon emission computed tomographic/computed tomographic (SPECT/CT) scan identified a lesion in the location of the right inferior parathyroid gland. In addition, CT showed associated lytic bone lesions of the left mandibular ramus, left scapula, and C5 vertebra.

These findings are consistent with parathyroid carcinoma. Parathyroid carcinoma is a rare, malignant tumor of the parathyroid gland. It is the most common endocrine malignancy, accounting for 0.1-0.5% of all cancers. Parathyroid carcinoma is more common in women than men, and the average age at diagnosis is 60 years.

The most common presenting symptom of parathyroid carcinoma is hypercalcemia. Other symptoms may include fatigue, weakness, bone pain, and kidney stones. The diagnosis of parathyroid carcinoma is made based on the patient's history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies.

The treatment for parathyroid carcinoma is surgery. The goal of surgery is to remove the tumor and any involved lymph nodes. In some cases, radiation therapy or chemotherapy may also be used. The prognosis for patients with parathyroid carcinoma is poor. The 5-year survival rate is 50-60%.

The other options are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation. Multiple myeloma is a cancer of the plasma cells. Primary bone tumors are tumors that arise from the bone itself. Osteitis fibrosa cystica is a condition that is caused by hyperparathyroidism.

The most likely diagnosis is multifocal granular cell tumor (MGCT). MGCT is a rare, benign tumor that can occur in any part of the body, but it is most commonly found in the larynx. The tumors are made up of a type of cell called a granular cell, which is a large, round cell with a granular cytoplasm. MGCTs are usually slow-growing and do not spread to other parts of the body. However, they can cause symptoms such as hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, and respiratory problems. Treatment for MGCT typically involves surgery to remove the tumor. In some cases, radiation therapy or chemotherapy may also be used.

**Explanation:**

The patient in the case has a history of respiratory distress requiring endotracheal intubation, choking and desaturation with oral feeding, and aspiration with all consistencies. These findings are consistent with a tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF). A TEF is a congenital anomaly in which there is an abnormal connection between the trachea and esophagus. This can result in aspiration of food and fluids into the lungs, leading to pneumonia. The diagnosis of TEF is confirmed by CT imaging, which shows a communication between the trachea and esophagus.

Pulmonary sequestration is a congenital anomaly in which a portion of lung tissue is not connected to the tracheobronchial tree. This can result in pneumonia, but it is not typically associated with the other findings in this case. Congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation (CCAM) is a congenital anomaly in which there are multiple cysts in the lung. This can also result in pneumonia, but it is not typically associated with the other findings in this case. Esophageal bronchus is a rare congenital anomaly in which there is an abnormal connection between the esophagus and bronchus.

The patient has a persistent Descemet membrane detachment with blood in the interface. This is a serious complication of canaloplasty, and it is important to take action to try to resolve it. A saline washout with an air bubble is a standard treatment for this condition. It is a relatively safe procedure that can be performed in the operating room. The goal of the procedure is to remove the blood from the interface and allow the Descemet membrane to reattach to the underlying tissue.

Continue to observe is not the correct answer because the patient has a persistent Descemet membrane detachment with blood in the interface. This is a serious complication that needs to be treated.

Laser Descemet membrane membranotomy is not the correct answer because this procedure is typically used to treat a different condition, such as a tear in the Descemet membrane. It is not the standard treatment for a persistent Descemet membrane detachment with blood in the interface.

Alteplase washout with an air bubble is not the correct answer because this is a newer treatment that is not yet well-studied for this condition. More research is needed to determine whether this treatment is safe and effective.

The patient's symptoms of blurry vision, pain, and photophobia are consistent with acute angle-closure glaucoma. This is a medical emergency that can lead to permanent vision loss if not treated promptly. The most important initial step is to lower the intraocular pressure (IOP). This can be done by instilling atropine and IOP-lowering drops, such as timolol or betaxolol. The patient should also be placed in a supine position to help prevent further elevation of the IOP.

A laser iridotomy is a procedure that creates a small opening in the iris, which allows fluid to flow from the anterior chamber into the posterior chamber. This can help to lower the IOP and relieve the symptoms of acute angle-closure glaucoma. However, it is not always necessary and should only be performed by an experienced ophthalmologist.

A pars plana vitrectomy is a more invasive procedure that involves removing the vitreous humor, a gel-like substance that fills the inside of the eye. This procedure is typically used to treat more advanced cases of glaucoma, but it may also be used in cases of acute angle-closure glaucoma that do not respond to medical therapy.

Pilocarpine is a medication that causes the pupil to constrict. This can be helpful in cases of acute angle-closure glaucoma, as it helps to open the drainage angle and lower the IOP. However, pilocarpine should not be used in all cases of acute angle-closure glaucoma, as it can worsen the condition in some patients.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C. Instill atropine and IOP-lowering drops and place the patient in a supine position. The other answers are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate initial treatment for acute angle-closure glaucoma.

Diffuse retinal hemorrhages can be caused by a variety of conditions, including blood disorders, vascular disorders, and trauma. In the case of this patient, the history of uncomplicated glaucoma drainage implant surgery suggests that the hemorrhages are most likely due to a blood disorder. A complete blood cell count and coagulation testing will help to identify the underlying cause of the hemorrhages and guide further management.

Oral and topical corticosteroids are not indicated in the management of diffuse retinal hemorrhages. Corticosteroids can cause retinal vasoconstriction, which could worsen the hemorrhages.

Plasmapheresis for hyperviscosity syndrome is a treatment option for patients with hematologic disorders that cause a high blood viscosity. This patient does not have a hematologic disorder, so plasmapheresis would not be appropriate.

Fluorescein angiography is a diagnostic test that can be used to visualize the retinal blood vessels. It is not a treatment option for diffuse retinal hemorrhages.

In conclusion, the correct answer is: A. Order a complete blood cell count and coagulation testing.

 64%|██████▍   | 978/1525 [3:43:53<1:40:49, 11.06s/it]Answer: D. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor of the small bowel

Explanation:

The patient in this case presents with a history of hypochromic microcytic anemia, small-bowel obstruction, and a small intraluminal mass on contrast-enhanced CT scan. The most likely diagnosis is a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST).

GISTs are mesenchymal tumors that arise from the interstitial cells of Cajal, which are specialized cells that regulate intestinal motility. They are the most common mesenchymal tumor of the gastrointestinal tract, accounting for approximately 1% of all gastrointestinal neoplasms.

GISTs can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract, but they are most common in the stomach (60%) and small bowel (30%). They are typically solitary tumors, but can be multiple in up to 10% of cases.

The most common symptom of GIST is abdominal pain, which can be intermittent or constant. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and bleeding.

The diagnosis of GIST is made on the basis of a history and physical examination, imaging studies, and biopsy. Imaging studies, such as CT scan or MRI, can help to identify the location and size of the tumor. Biopsy is necessary to confirm the diagnosis and to determine the grade of the tumor.

The treatment of GIST depends on the size, location, and grade of the tumor. Small, low-grade tumors can be treated with surgery alone. Larger tumors or tumors that are not amenable to surgery may be treated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

In some cases, GISTs may be resistant to conventional treatment. In these cases, targeted therapy with drugs such as imatinib (Gleevec) may be used. Targeted therapy drugs work by targeting specific proteins that are found on the surface of GIST cells.

The prognosis for patients with GIST is generally good. With appropriate treatment, the majority of patients will have a long-term survival. However, some patients may develop recurrence of the tumor, and a small number of patients may die from the disease.

The other possible diagnoses in this case are small-bowel adenocarcinoma, lymphoma of the small bowel, and carcinoid tumor. However, these tumors are less likely to cause small-bowel obstruction than GIST. Additionally, GISTs are the most common mesenchymal tumor of the gastrointestinal tract, accounting for approximately 1% of all gastrointestinal neoplasms.

 64%|██████▍   | 979/1525 [3:44:09<1:55:04, 12.64s/it]The correct answer is **B: Retrocecal acute appendicitis**.

The patient presents with a 48-hour history of exacerbating right lower quadrant and epigastric abdominal pain. The pain is colicky in nature and started after eating cornflakes. The patient has also had some hospitalizations for nonspecific abdominal pain during his infancy. On physical examination, there is localized tenderness and guarding in the epigastric region and in the right lower quadrant. Hyperactive bowel sounds can be heard. The results of a digital rectal examination are normal. The patient's vital signs are within normal limits, except for an elevated white blood cell count of 13 000/μL. A plain radiograph of the abdomen is negative for air-fluid levels and for signs of perforation. Further evaluation of the patient's abdomen using ultrasonography revealed hepatic steatosis and, in the right lower quadrant, thickening of the cecal wall and a hypoechoic area 33 mm in diameter with blurred margins.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is acute appendicitis. Appendicitis is a common condition that affects the appendix, a small, finger-shaped organ that projects from the cecum, the first part of the large intestine. The appendix is located in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. Acute appendicitis is caused by obstruction of the appendix, which can be due to a foreign body, inflammation, or infection. The obstruction leads to inflammation and infection of the appendix, which can eventually rupture.

The symptoms of acute appendicitis typically include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and fever. The pain is usually located in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen and is often described as being colicky in nature. The pain may be constant or intermittent, and it may be aggravated by movement or coughing. The patient may also experience nausea and vomiting, and they may have a fever.

The diagnosis of acute appendicitis is made based on the patient's history and physical examination findings. Imaging studies, such as an abdominal CT scan or ultrasound, can be helpful in confirming the diagnosis. Treatment for acute appendicitis is surgical removal of the appendix. The surgery is usually performed laparoscopically, which is a minimally invasive procedure.

The complications of acute appendicitis include perforation of the appendix, peritonitis, and sepsis. Perforation of the appendix occurs when the appendix ruptures, which can release bacteria into the abdominal cavity. Peritonitis is an inflammation of the lining of the abdomen, and sepsis is a life-threatening infection of the bloodstream.

The prognosis for acute appendicitis is good if the diagnosis is made early and the appendix is removed surgically. The mortality rate for acute appendicitis is less than 1%.

In this case, the patient's symptoms are consistent with acute appendicitis. The patient has abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and fever. The pain is located in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen and is described as being colicky in nature. The patient also has a white blood cell count of 13 000/μL, which is elevated. The ultrasonographic findings show thickening of the cecal wall and a hypoechoic area 33 mm in diameter with blurred margins. These findings are consistent with acute appendicitis.

The other possible diagnoses in this case are cecal carcinoma, cecal diverticulitis, and terminal ileitis. Cecal carcinoma is a rare cancer that can occur in the cecum. The symptoms of cecal carcinoma are usually vague and nonspecific, and they may include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. Cecal diverticulitis is an inflammation of the diverticula, which are small pouches that can form in the lining of the colon. The symptoms of cecal diverticulitis include abdominal pain, fever, and nausea. Terminal ileitis is an inflammation of the terminal ileum, which is the last part of the small intestine. The symptoms of terminal ileitis include abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss.

In this case, the patient's symptoms are most consistent with acute appendicitis. The patient has abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and fever. The pain is located in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen and is described as being colicky in nature. The patient also has a white blood cell count of 13 000/μL, which is elevated. The ultrasonographic findings show thickening of the cecal wall and a hypoechoic area 33 mm in diameter with blurred margins. These findings are consistent with acute appendicitis.

 64%|██████▍   | 980/1525 [3:44:26<2:05:11, 13.78s/it]The answer is **B. Meningioma**.

Meningiomas are the most common primary brain tumor in adults, accounting for 23% of all intracranial tumors. They are typically slow-growing tumors that arise from the meninges, the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. Meningiomas can be benign (noncancerous) or malignant (cancerous).

The most common symptom of a meningioma is a headache. Other symptoms may include seizures, vision problems, weakness, numbness, and changes in personality or behavior.

The diagnosis of a meningioma is usually made with a brain MRI or CT scan. A biopsy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and determine the type of meningioma.

The treatment of meningioma depends on the size, location, and type of tumor. Benign meningiomas can often be treated with surgery alone. Malignant meningiomas may require surgery, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy.

The prognosis for patients with meningioma is generally good. With treatment, most patients can expect to live long and healthy lives.

The following are some reasons why meningioma is the most likely diagnosis in this case:

* The patient is an elderly woman, which is the most common age group for meningioma.
* The patient has a rapidly enlarging scalp mass, which is a common presentation for meningioma.
* The patient has neurological symptoms, such as headache, weakness, and seizures, which are also common with meningioma.
* The patient's MRI shows a large, enhancing mass that extends both extracranially and intracranially, which is a typical finding for meningioma.
* The patient's CT scan shows a ground-glass sclerotic lesion of the right sacrum, which is a rare but known metastasis site for meningioma.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely for the following reasons:

* Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of blood cancer that can spread to the brain, but it is not typically associated with a rapidly enlarging scalp mass.
* Glioblastoma multiforme is the most common type of primary brain tumor in adults, but it is typically a fast-growing tumor that does not cause neurological symptoms until it is large.
* Meningeal sarcoma is a rare type of brain tumor that is typically associated with a history of radiation therapy to the head.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is meningioma.

 64%|██████▍   | 981/1525 [3:44:42<2:11:35, 14.51s/it]The answer is **B. Initiate antiviral therapy with valacyclovir.**

The patient has a painful rash on the sole of his foot that is consistent with herpes zoster, also known as shingles. Shingles is a viral infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox. Once a person has chickenpox, the virus remains dormant in the body and can reactivate years later to cause shingles.

Shingles is characterized by a painful rash with blisters that typically appear on one side of the body, often in a band around the trunk. The rash usually goes away on its own within a few weeks, but it can be very painful.

Antiviral medications, such as valacyclovir, can be effective in reducing the severity and duration of shingles. Antiviral therapy should be started as soon as possible after the rash appears.

In this case, the patient's rash is consistent with shingles and he has no other medical conditions that would make him at increased risk for complications from the infection. Therefore, the best course of treatment is to initiate antiviral therapy with valacyclovir.

* * *

Here are the reasons why the other options are incorrect:

* Option A, obtain blood cultures, is incorrect because blood cultures are not typically necessary to diagnose shingles. Shingles is a clinical diagnosis, meaning that it is diagnosed based on the patient's history and physical examination.
* Option C, prescribe an oral antihistamine agent, is incorrect because antihistamines are not effective in treating shingles. Shingles is caused by a virus, and antihistamines are not effective against viruses.
* Option D, prescribe a topical corticosteroid cream, is incorrect because topical corticosteroid creams can actually worsen the symptoms of shingles. Topical corticosteroid creams can suppress the immune system, which can make the shingles infection worse.

The patient in this case has a diagnosis of acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis (AFND), also known as Sweet's syndrome. AFND is a rare, self-limited inflammatory disorder that typically presents with fever, rash, and leukocytosis. The rash is characterized by clusters of small, painful pustules that often occur on the extremities, trunk, and face.

The underlying cause of AFND is unknown, but it is thought to be an immune-mediated reaction. Ibuprofen and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been implicated in triggering AFND in some cases. Therefore, the first step in treatment is to avoid further use of NSAIDs.

Topical steroids are often used to treat the rash associated with AFND. They can help to reduce inflammation and itching. Oral steroids may also be necessary in some cases.

In most cases, AFND resolves spontaneously within a few weeks. However, there is a risk of recurrence. Patients should be monitored closely for signs of infection or other complications.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* B: Infliximab is a biologic drug that is used to treat autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease. It is not indicated for the treatment of AFND.
* C: Cephalexin is an antibiotic that is used to treat bacterial infections. It is not indicated for the treatment of AFND, which is a non-infectious disorder.
* D: An HIV immunoassay is a test that is used to screen for HIV infection. It is not indicated in this case because there is no evidence that the patient is infected with HIV.

 64%|██████▍   | 983/1525 [3:45:10<2:08:19, 14.21s/it]The correct answer is: B. Obtain a brain biopsy.

The patient is a 24-year-old man with a left frontal brain mass. He is HIV-positive and has a CD4 cell count of 73/mm3. This suggests that he is severely immunocompromised. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a brain mass, and the imaging studies show a mass lesion in the left frontal lobe.

The next step in management is to obtain a brain biopsy to determine the cause of the mass. The differential diagnosis for a brain mass in an HIV-positive patient includes primary CNS lymphoma, toxoplasmosis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, and cryptococcal meningitis. A brain biopsy is the only way to definitively diagnose the cause of the mass.

Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is not the next step in management because the patient's CD4 cell count is already very low. ART would not be expected to improve the patient's symptoms or prognosis.

A lumbar puncture is not the next step in management because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with meningitis. Lumbar puncture is indicated in patients with meningitis to diagnose the cause of the infection and to assess for hydrocephalus.

Treatment for central nervous system (CNS) toxoplasmosis is not the next step in management because the patient's serologic testing for Toxoplasma gondii IgG was negative. CNS toxoplasmosis is a common opportunistic infection in HIV-positive patients, but it is not the most likely diagnosis in this patient.

Therefore, the next step in management is to obtain a brain biopsy.

 65%|██████▍   | 984/1525 [3:45:23<2:04:06, 13.76s/it]The correct answer is B: Methimazole-induced vasculitis.

Methimazole is a medication used to treat hyperthyroidism. It works by decreasing the production of thyroid hormone. Methimazole can cause a variety of side effects, including vasculitis. Vasculitis is inflammation of the blood vessels. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including skin lesions, fever, and joint pain.

The patient in the case presented with painful lesions on her bilateral lower extremities. She also reported chills, bilateral lower extremity swelling, and several small, painful, “pimple-like bumps” appearing on her bilateral lower legs, which ulcerated several days later. The ulcers progressed despite a recent course of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for cultures growing methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus. The patient’s medications included methimazole and atenolol, which she had been taking since her diagnosis of Graves disease 1 year prior. She had not taken other over-the-counter medications or supplements.

Physical examination of her bilateral lower extremities revealed pitting edema and multiple discrete, round, dry ulcers, most with central eschars, dusky gray borders, and collarettes of scale. Results from the initial laboratory workup revealed elevated levels of C-reactive protein and increased erythrocyte sedimentation rate. A punch biopsy specimen of an ulcer edge demonstrated a mid- and deep dermal marked lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with neutrophils and focal abscess, suggesting a nonspecific infection. The patient was initially treated with cephalexin, mupirocin, and conservative wound care, but the eruption later worsened, with new lesions appearing on her right leg. During follow-up, an intact 4-mm papular lesion was identified on her lower right leg. No pathergy at the previous punch biopsy site was observed. A biopsy of the new intact papule was performed.

The histopathological images from the punch biopsy specimen of the papule showed a leukocytoclastic vasculitis with fibrinoid necrosis of the vessel walls. This finding is consistent with a diagnosis of methimazole-induced vasculitis.

Other possible diagnoses for the patient’s presentation include polyarteritis nodosa, ecthyma, and pyoderma gangrenosum. Polyarteritis nodosa is a systemic vasculitis that can affect the small and medium-sized arteries. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including fever, weight loss, muscle pain, and joint pain. Ecthyma is a bacterial skin infection that can cause ulcers on the skin. It is most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare skin condition that can cause ulcers on the skin. It is often associated with underlying autoimmune diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease or rheumatoid arthritis.

The patient’s presentation is most consistent with a diagnosis of methimazole-induced vasculitis. The patient has a history of taking methimazole, and she developed painful lesions on her bilateral lower extremities after starting the medication. The lesions progressed despite treatment with antibiotics, and a biopsy of the lesions showed a leukocytoclastic vasculitis. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of methimazole-induced vasculitis.

Explanation:

The patient in the case presentation has a 7-year history of a progressive pruritic eruption involving the nose and dorsal hands. He had no improvement following treatment with class 1 topical corticosteroids and keratolytic emollients. On review of systems, he endorsed photosensitivity during childhood only. He denied any history of blistering, angioedema, dysphagia, hoarseness, dyspnea, or weight loss. Physical examination revealed multiple skin-colored, waxy, smooth and variably verrucous papules and plaques on the dorsum of the nose and hands. A punch biopsy specimen was obtained from the left dorsal hand for further evaluation.

The histopathologic findings of the biopsy specimen are consistent with nodular amyloidosis. Amyloidosis is a group of diseases characterized by the deposition of amyloid, an abnormal protein, in various organs and tissues. Nodular amyloidosis is a rare variant of amyloidosis that typically affects the skin. The lesions of nodular amyloidosis are typically waxy, smooth, and variably verrucous papules and plaques. They are often pruritic and may be associated with pain or tenderness.

The diagnosis of nodular amyloidosis is made based on the clinical presentation, histopathologic findings, and laboratory testing. The treatment of nodular amyloidosis is typically with systemic corticosteroids. Other treatments that may be used include local corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, and phototherapy.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Erythropoietic protoporphyria is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by photosensitivity, anemia, and liver disease. The lesions of erythropoietic protoporphyria are typically blisters and vesicles that are sensitive to light.
* Colloid milium is a benign condition that is characterized by small, white, papules on the face. The lesions of colloid milium are typically asymptomatic and do not require treatment.
* Lipoid proteinosis is a rare genetic disorder that is characterized by the accumulation of lipid-rich material in the skin, viscera, and nervous system. The lesions of lipoid proteinosis are typically waxy, yellow papules and plaques that are distributed on the face, neck, and upper trunk.

Atypical hand-foot-mouth disease is an acute viral illness that is characterized by a vesicular eruption of the hands, feet, and mouth. It is most common in children under the age of 10, but can occur in adults. The most common cause is coxsackievirus A16, but other viruses, such as enterovirus 71, can also cause the disease. The diagnosis is usually made clinically, based on the characteristic rash. Treatment is supportive, with fluids and rest.

Disseminated zoster is a reactivation of varicella-zoster virus (VZV) that occurs in patients with weakened immune systems. It is characterized by a vesicular eruption that follows the distribution of a single dermatome. The most common risk factors for disseminated zoster are advanced age, immunosuppression, and malignancy. The diagnosis is usually made clinically, based on the characteristic rash. Treatment is with antiviral medications, such as acyclovir or valacyclovir.

Erythema multiforme is a skin condition that is characterized by a variety of skin lesions, including macules, papules, vesicles, and bullae. It is often associated with an underlying infection, such as herpes simplex virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, or Epstein-Barr virus. The diagnosis is usually made clinically, based on the characteristic rash. Treatment is supportive, with fluids and rest.

Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is a small vessel vasculitis that is characterized by the presence of neutrophils and fibrinoid necrosis in the walls of small blood vessels. It can occur in a variety of settings, including infections, drugs, and autoimmune diseases. The diagnosis is made by biopsy. Treatment is with corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive medications.

In the case presented, the patient has a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and is prescribed cyclosporine, 100 mg twice daily, for pure red cell aplasia. He initially developed rhinorrhea, cough, and low-grade fever 2 weeks prior. The patient was treated with azithromycin and subsequently developed few small, pruritic blisters on the hands and feet. He went to an urgent care facility and was diagnosed as having bronchitis and prescribed doxycycline and diphenhydramine. Over the next several days, he developed worsening fever, chills, and blisters and bullae on the arms, legs, and face. He was admitted to the hospital, and the dermatology service was consulted. Physical examination revealed numerous pink to violaceous macules, papules, and patches on the palms, dorsal hands, forearms, elbows, feet, and distal lower extremities. Fewer, scattered macules were on the face, neck, trunk, upper legs, upper arms, and scrotum. Dusky bullae were seen on the bilateral dorsal aspect of the hands, fingers, toes, and heels. In the oral cavity, there was 1 violaceous macule on the right buccal mucosa and a few linear, horizontal, white lines on the left buccal mucosa. Laboratory findings revealed a white blood cell count of 25 600/μL (reference range, 3700-10 500/μL) and a platelet count of 12 400/μL (reference range, 15 000-40 000/μL). Results from a Tzanck smear from the initial lesion on the right dorsal aspects of the third finger were negative for multinucleated giant cells. A punch biopsy was performed on the anterior side of the thigh.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is leukocytoclastic vasculitis. This is supported by the patient's history of CLL and cyclosporine use, the presence of a widespread vesicular eruption, and the findings on biopsy. Atypical hand-foot-mouth disease, disseminated zoster, and erythema multiforme are less likely diagnoses in this case.

Explanation:

The most likely diagnosis for this patient is paraneoplastic cerebellar ataxia. This is a rare condition that occurs when a tumor produces antibodies that attack the cerebellum, the part of the brain that controls balance and coordination. The patient's history of progressive difficulty walking, hearing problems, and cognitive decline are all consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's MRI scan was unremarkable, which suggests that the ataxia is not due to a structural abnormality in the brain. The patient's CSF testing was also normal, which rules out other possible causes of cerebellar ataxia, such as multiple sclerosis and Lyme disease. The patient's paraneoplastic antibodies were positive, which provides further evidence for the diagnosis of paraneoplastic cerebellar ataxia.

Wernicke encephalopathy is a thiamine deficiency that can cause a variety of symptoms, including ataxia, confusion, and nystagmus. However, the patient's history and examination are not consistent with Wernicke encephalopathy. The patient does not have a history of alcohol abuse, which is a risk factor for Wernicke encephalopathy. The patient's mental status is not severely impaired, and the patient does not have nystagmus.

Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a rare, fatal neurodegenerative disease that can cause ataxia, dementia, and seizures. However, the patient's history and examination are not consistent with Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. The patient is relatively young, and the disease is typically seen in older adults. The patient's mental status is not severely impaired, and the patient does not have seizures.

CADASIL is a rare, inherited disorder that affects the small blood vessels in the brain. It causes progressive damage to the white matter of the brain, which can lead to a variety of symptoms, including personality changes, executive dysfunction, motor and memory impairment, seizures, and stroke.

The diagnosis of CADASIL is based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. Imaging studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), can show characteristic changes in the white matter of the brain. Genetic testing can also be used to confirm the diagnosis.

There is no cure for CADASIL, but there are treatments that can help to manage the symptoms. These include medications to control seizures, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels. Physical therapy and occupational therapy can also help to improve function.

The prognosis for people with CADASIL varies depending on the severity of the disease. Some people with CADASIL have a relatively mild course of the disease, while others experience more severe symptoms. The average life expectancy for people with CADASIL is about 50 years.

Here are some reasons why CADASIL is the most likely diagnosis in this case:

* The patient's mother had a chronic neuropsychiatric illness, culminating in a rapidly progressive dementia. This is a common presentation of CADASIL.
* The patient's MRI showed scattered small foci of T2 hyperintensity in the white matter affecting the corpus callosum, bifrontal, and biparietal regions, associated with bifrontal and bitemporal atrophy. These are characteristic findings of CADASIL.
* The patient's laboratory investigations were unrevealing. This is consistent with CADASIL, which is not caused by an infection, metabolic disorder, or autoimmune disease.
* The patient's cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed a slight protein elevation, but no pleocytosis, oligoclonal bands, or elevated immunoglobulin G synthesis rate. This is also consistent with CADASIL.

Adrenoleukodystrophy, mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes, and hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids are all rare disorders that can cause white matter disease. However, they do not typically present with the same combination of symptoms as CADASIL. In addition, the patient's MRI findings are not typical of these disorders.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is CADASIL.

 65%|██████▍   | 990/1525 [3:47:01<2:21:22, 15.86s/it]The answer is D: Implant a loop recorder.

The patient has a history of exercise-induced syncope, and a resting ECG that shows first-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, borderline right axis deviation, and right bundle branch block. These findings are concerning for a possible arrhythmogenic cause of syncope. An implantable loop recorder (ILR) is a small device that is placed under the skin in the chest and can record the patient's heart rhythm continuously for up to 3 years. This information can be used to identify the cause of syncope, even if it occurs only rarely.

Tilt table testing and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are both useful tests for evaluating patients with syncope, but they are not as likely to be helpful in this case. Tilt table testing is used to assess for vasovagal syncope, which is a common cause of syncope. However, the patient's history and ECG findings are not consistent with vasovagal syncope. Cardiac MRI can be used to evaluate for structural heart disease, which can be a cause of syncope. However, the patient's coronary angiogram showed no obstructive epicardial coronary artery disease. Therefore, an ILR is the most appropriate test to evaluate this patient's syncope.

Explanation:

A. Obtain tilt table testing

Tilt table testing is a procedure that is used to assess for vasovagal syncope, which is a common cause of syncope. In tilt table testing, the patient is placed on a table that is tilted upright. This causes a decrease in blood flow to the brain, which can trigger a vasovagal response and syncope. If the patient faints during tilt table testing, it is evidence of vasovagal syncope.

However, the patient's history and ECG findings are not consistent with vasovagal syncope. The patient has a history of exercise-induced syncope, which is more likely to be caused by a cardiac arrhythmia. The patient's ECG shows first-degree AV block, borderline right axis deviation, and right bundle branch block. These findings are concerning for a possible arrhythmogenic cause of syncope.

Therefore, tilt table testing is not the most appropriate test to evaluate this patient's syncope.

B. Obtain cardiac magnetic resonance imaging

Cardiac MRI is a test that is used to evaluate the structure of the heart. Cardiac MRI can be used to evaluate for structural heart disease, which can be a cause of syncope. However, the patient's coronary angiogram showed no obstructive epicardial coronary artery disease. Therefore, cardiac MRI is not the most appropriate test to evaluate this patient's syncope.

C. Place a dual chamber pacemaker

A dual chamber pacemaker is a device that is placed in the chest and delivers electrical pulses to the heart to regulate the heart rate. A dual chamber pacemaker is sometimes used to treat patients who have syncope caused by bradycardia, which is a slow heart rate. However, the patient's ECG does not show evidence of bradycardia. Therefore, placing a dual chamber pacemaker is not the most appropriate treatment for this patient.

D. Implant a loop recorder

An implantable loop recorder (ILR) is a small device that is placed under the skin in the chest and can record the patient's heart rhythm continuously for up to 3 years. This information can be used to identify the cause of syncope, even if it occurs only rarely.

The patient has a history of exercise-induced syncope, and a resting ECG that shows first-degree AV block, borderline right axis deviation, and right bundle branch block. These findings are concerning for a possible arrhythmogenic cause of syncope. An ILR is the most appropriate test to evaluate this patient's syncope.

 65%|██████▍   | 991/1525 [3:47:17<2:22:10, 15.98s/it]The answer is: **B. McCune-Albright syndrome.**

McCune-Albright syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that causes overgrowth of certain tissues in the body. It is characterized by three main features: café-au-lait spots, fibrous dysplasia, and precocious puberty.

Café-au-lait spots are flat, brown patches of skin that are usually present at birth. They can vary in size and shape, and they can occur anywhere on the body.

Fibrous dysplasia is a condition that causes abnormal growth of bone. It can affect any bone in the body, but it is most commonly seen in the long bones, such as the femurs and tibias. Fibrous dysplasia can cause pain, fractures, and deformities of the affected bones.

Precocious puberty is the development of secondary sexual characteristics at an early age. In girls, this can include the development of breasts, pubic hair, and menstruation. In boys, it can include the development of a deep voice, facial hair, and enlargement of the penis and testicles.

The diagnosis of McCune-Albright syndrome is based on the presence of the three main features, as well as other findings, such as elevated levels of a hormone called adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). There is no cure for McCune-Albright syndrome, but treatment can help to manage the symptoms. Treatment may include surgery to correct bone deformities, medication to control pain, and hormone therapy to treat precocious puberty.

The other options are incorrect because they do not match the clinical presentation of the patient. Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disorder that affects the cells of the immune system. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including bone pain, skin lesions, and eye problems. Juvenile Paget disease is a rare disorder that affects the bones. It can cause pain, fractures, and deformities of the affected bones. Ossifying fibromas are benign tumors that can occur in the bones. They can cause pain, swelling, and deformity of the affected bone.

Explanation:

A neuroma is a benign tumor made up of nerve tissue. A hamartoma is a noncancerous growth that contains a mixture of tissues that are normally found in the area where the growth occurs. A neuromuscular hamartoma is a rare type of hamartoma that contains both nerve and muscle tissue.

The patient in this case presented with a 1-cm mobile, well-defined, nontender mass over the nasal dorsum. The mass was found to be a neuromuscular hamartoma on histopathologic examination. Neuromuscular hamartomas are typically found in the head and neck region, and they are usually asymptomatic. However, they can cause symptoms such as pain, numbness, or weakness. Treatment for neuromuscular hamartomas is typically surgical excision.

The other options are incorrect because they are not consistent with the clinical presentation and histopathologic findings in this case. A glioma is a type of brain tumor that is made up of glial cells. Rhabdomyosarcoma is a type of soft tissue cancer that is made up of rhabdomyoblasts, which are immature muscle cells. Rhabdomyomatous mesenchymal hamartoma is a rare type of hamartoma that contains both rhabdomyoblasts and mesenchymal tissue.

 65%|██████▌   | 993/1525 [3:47:43<2:08:17, 14.47s/it]The correct answer is A: Amyloidosis.

The patient is a man in his 60s with a history of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, and gout. He also has a 10-pack-year smoking history and Agent Orange exposure. He presents with a hoarse voice for the past year. On examination, he has no palpable neck masses and his cranial nerves are grossly intact. His voice is rough. He undergoes a flexible laryngoscopy, which shows an exophytic yellow-white mid-membranous subepithelial lesion on the bilateral true vocal folds. On stroboscopy, there is decreased vibratory amplitude bilaterally and moderate phase asymmetry. Several weeks later, he undergoes an indirect laryngoscopy and vocal fold biopsy in the office. Grossly, pathologic findings show a chalky white lesion. Histopathologic review shows submucosal amorphous eosinophilic material. The amorphous material is negative for Congo red. Examination of an unstained slide shows needle-shaped birefringent crystals.

The differential diagnosis for a chalky white lesion on the vocal folds includes amyloidosis, laryngeal gout, rheumatoid nodules, and squamous cell carcinoma.

Amyloidosis is a condition in which abnormal proteins accumulate in the body's tissues and organs. It can affect the heart, kidneys, liver, brain, and other organs. The most common type of amyloidosis is AL amyloidosis, which is caused by the production of abnormal proteins by plasma cells.

Laryngeal gout is a rare condition that occurs when uric acid crystals deposit in the larynx. It is most commonly seen in people with gout, a condition in which uric acid levels in the blood are high.

Rheumatoid nodules are small, firm nodules that can form in the joints, tendons, and other tissues in people with rheumatoid arthritis.

Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that starts in the squamous cells that line the larynx. It is the most common type of cancer of the larynx.

The patient's history of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, and gout makes amyloidosis a more likely diagnosis than laryngeal gout, rheumatoid nodules, or squamous cell carcinoma. The negative Congo red stain also supports the diagnosis of amyloidosis.

The patient's treatment options include observation, laser photoangiolysis, and surgery. Observation is a reasonable option for patients with asymptomatic amyloidosis. Laser photoangiolysis is a procedure that uses a laser to destroy the amyloid deposits. Surgery may be necessary for patients with symptomatic amyloidosis or for patients who do not respond to other treatments.

The patient's prognosis depends on the extent of the amyloidosis and the organs involved. Patients with localized amyloidosis have a good prognosis, while patients with widespread amyloidosis have a poorer prognosis.

 65%|██████▌   | 994/1525 [3:47:59<2:13:11, 15.05s/it]Answer: B. Dermoid cyst

Explanation:
A dermoid cyst is a type of cyst that is formed from skin cells. It is usually filled with keratin, which is the same material that makes up hair and nails. Dermoid cysts are most common in the head and neck area, but they can also occur in other parts of the body.

The patient in the case presented with a 10-day history of swelling in the sublingual area. The swelling had been progressively increasing over the first 3 days but had remained stable over the past week. He denied any history of similar symptoms, pain, fever, odynophagia, or difficulty breathing. He complained of some difficulty swallowing owing to the swelling. He had a history of hypertension and had been prescribed a blood pressure medication (the name of which he could not remember), but he had not been taking it for weeks. He had no other pertinent medical history. Physical examination revealed significant, soft, nontender swelling of the floor of mouth bilaterally causing elevation of the tongue. There was no edema of the tongue or lips. The neck was soft, nontender to palpation, and without palpable lymphadenopathy. Computed tomographic (CT) imaging of the soft tissues of the neck with intravenous contrast showed a 6.3-cm anteroposterior × 6.9-cm cranial caudal × 4.8-cm transverse cystic nonenhancing mass centered in the root of the tongue, with elevation of the oral aspect of the tongue and some downward displacement of the floor of mouth. The sublingual glands were compressed but otherwise appeared normal, and the sublingual spaces were effaced. Surgical excision via an intraoral approach yielded a smooth, well-circumscribed mass. Histologic examination showed keratinizing squamous epithelium.

The patient's history, physical examination, and CT findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of a dermoid cyst. The patient's history of hypertension and non-compliance with his blood pressure medication may have contributed to the development of the cyst. The CT findings show a well-circumscribed, non-enhancing mass in the floor of mouth. This is a typical appearance for a dermoid cyst. The surgical excision of the mass and the histologic examination showing keratinizing squamous epithelium confirm the diagnosis.

Foregut duplication cysts, sublingual abscesses, and thyroglossal duct cysts are all other possible diagnoses for the patient's presentation. However, the patient's history, physical examination, and CT findings are more consistent with a diagnosis of a dermoid cyst.

Foregut duplication cysts are rare congenital anomalies that can occur anywhere along the foregut from the pharynx to the anus. They are most commonly found in the small intestine. Foregut duplication cysts are lined with epithelium that is similar to the epithelium of the foregut. They can be filled with fluid, mucus, or air.

Sublingual abscesses are infections of the sublingual glands. They are usually caused by bacteria that enter the gland through the duct that carries saliva from the gland to the mouth. Sublingual abscesses are characterized by pain, swelling, and redness of the sublingual area.

Thyroglossal duct cysts are congenital anomalies that are caused by the incomplete involution of the thyroglossal duct. The thyroglossal duct is a tube that connects the thyroid gland to the base of the tongue during fetal development. If the thyroglossal duct does not involute completely, a cyst can form. Thyroglossal duct cysts are usually located in the midline of the neck, just below the hyoid bone. They can be filled with fluid or mucus.

The patient's history, physical examination, and CT findings are more consistent with a diagnosis of a dermoid cyst than with a diagnosis of a foregut duplication cyst, a sublingual abscess, or a thyroglossal duct cyst. Therefore, the patient's diagnosis is most likely a dermoid cyst.

The patient is a visually asymptomatic Hispanic man in his early 20s with a dark retinal lesion in his left eye that was initially discovered 4 years prior. He has no history of ocular trauma or other medical problems. His visual acuity is 20/20 OU, and there is no retinal traction. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) shows an abruptly elevated retinal mass characterized by significant protrusion into the vitreous cavity with enhanced surface reflectivity and deep optical shadowing.

Given the patient's age, lack of symptoms, and normal visual acuity, it is unlikely that the lesion is malignant. However, it is important to rule out a malignancy, such as a choroidal melanoma, before making a definitive diagnosis. Staging workup, such as total-body positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging (PET/CT), can help to determine the extent of the disease and guide treatment decisions.

Genetic testing is not necessary in this case because the patient has no family history of cancer and the lesion is not typical of a genetic disorder. Observation with normal follow-up is also not appropriate because the lesion is concerning for a malignancy. Surgical excision and histopathologic analysis may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis and stage the disease, but it is not the first step in management.

Therefore, the correct answer is: **D. Staging workup (eg, total-body positron emission tomography/computed tomography imaging)**.

The patient has a history of basal cell carcinoma that was resected from the right medial canthus. He is now presenting with right-sided ptosis, conjunctival hyperemia, and recurrent central corneal erosions. These findings are concerning for a possible recurrence of the basal cell carcinoma. A biopsy of the eyelid is the best way to confirm or rule out this diagnosis.

Doxycycline and tobramycin-dexamethasone ointment are both treatments for blepharitis, but they are not effective against basal cell carcinoma. Repairing the ptosis would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

The patient in the case presented with unilateral optic nerve edema with preserved visual function. The most common causes of unilateral optic nerve edema are optic neuritis, anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, and posterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Optic neuritis is a demyelinating disease of the optic nerve that is typically associated with multiple sclerosis. Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy is a vascular disorder of the optic nerve that is typically caused by atherosclerosis. Posterior ischemic optic neuropathy is a vascular disorder of the optic nerve that is typically caused by hypertension.

In this case, the patient's history and examination are most consistent with optic neuritis. The patient's history of intermittent blurry vision is typical of optic neuritis. The patient's examination findings of optic nerve head edema with peripapillary flame hemorrhages are also typical of optic neuritis.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient is to order bloodwork and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits. Bloodwork can be used to rule out other causes of optic nerve edema, such as multiple sclerosis, anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, and posterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits can be used to rule out other causes of optic nerve edema, such as tumors, infection, and inflammation.

Lumbar puncture with opening pressure measurement and cerebrospinal fluid analysis is not indicated in this case because the patient's history and examination findings are most consistent with optic neuritis. Optic neuritis is not a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system, so lumbar puncture is not necessary to rule out multiple sclerosis.

Molecular testing for Leber hereditary optic neuropathy is not indicated in this case because the patient's history and examination findings are not consistent with Leber hereditary optic neuropathy. Leber hereditary optic neuropathy is an inherited disorder that typically affects men in their 20s and 30s. The patient in this case is a man in his 50s, so he is at a lower risk for Leber hereditary optic neuropathy.

Computed tomography of the orbits is not indicated in this case because the patient's history and examination findings are not consistent with a mass lesion in the orbits. Mass lesions in the orbits can cause optic nerve compression, which can lead to optic nerve edema. However, the patient in this case has no history of visual loss or other symptoms that would suggest a mass lesion in the orbits.

Explanation:

The patient has a history of appendectomy, and now presents with abdominal pain, leukocytosis, and tenderness in the right lower quadrant. Abdominal computed tomography shows calcification in the terminal ileum with surrounding enteritis. These findings are consistent with Crohn ileitis, a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract.

Stump appendicitis is a rare complication of appendectomy in which the stump of the appendix becomes inflamed. It is typically seen in patients who have had an appendectomy for acute appendicitis. The patient in this case does not have a history of acute appendicitis, so stump appendicitis is not a likely diagnosis.

Foreign body ingestion is a common cause of intestinal perforation in children. In adults, it is more likely to occur in patients with mental illness or substance abuse. The patient in this case does not have any risk factors for foreign body ingestion, so this is not a likely diagnosis.

Carcinoid is a rare neuroendocrine tumor that can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract. It is most commonly found in the small intestine. The patient in this case does not have any symptoms or signs of carcinoid, so this is not a likely diagnosis.

Explanation:

The patient presented with a mobile smooth-surfaced polypoid subepithelial lesion at the posterolateral wall of the gastroesophageal junction. The mass flopped back and forth into the gastroesophageal junction. Mucosal biopsies were performed, which were consistent with normal squamous mucosal epithelium. Following this, endoscopic ultrasonography was performed, which demonstrated an anechoic, loculated, subepithelial lesion located within the submucosa of the distal esophagus. The endosonographic borders were well defined without invasion into the nearby structures. Manometry and 24-hour pH testing revealed preserved motility but abnormal acid exposure of the distal esophagus. Ultrasonography of the liver, gallbladder, and pancreas revealed no abnormalities.

The most likely diagnosis is inclusion cyst. Inclusion cysts are the most common type of subepithelial lesion of the esophagus. They are usually asymptomatic and are found incidentally on endoscopy. They are thought to arise from inclusion of epithelial cells during the development of the esophagus. Inclusion cysts are typically small, smooth, and mobile. They are usually located in the distal esophagus. Endoscopic ultrasonography can be used to confirm the diagnosis and to exclude other possible causes of a subepithelial lesion.

Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are rare mesenchymal tumors that can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract. They are typically diagnosed in adults between the ages of 50 and 70 years. GISTs are often asymptomatic but can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, bleeding, and weight loss. GISTs are typically diagnosed on endoscopy or CT scan. Treatment of GISTs depends on the size, location, and grade of the tumor. Surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment for localized GISTs. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy may be used for unresectable or metastatic GISTs.

Esophageal carcinoma is a type of cancer that starts in the esophagus. It is the sixth most common cancer in the world and the eighth most common cause of cancer death. Esophageal carcinoma is more common in men than women. The most common symptom of esophageal carcinoma is dysphagia (difficulty swallowing). Other symptoms may include chest pain, weight loss, and coughing up blood. Esophageal carcinoma is typically diagnosed on endoscopy. Treatment of esophageal carcinoma depends on the stage of the cancer. Surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment for early-stage esophageal carcinoma. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy may be used for advanced-stage esophageal carcinoma.

Bronchogenic cysts are rare congenital malformations that can occur anywhere in the lung. They are typically diagnosed in children but can occur in adults. Bronchogenic cysts are usually asymptomatic but can cause symptoms such as cough, wheezing, and chest pain. Bronchogenic cysts are typically diagnosed on chest X-ray or CT scan. Treatment of bronchogenic cysts depends on the size, location, and symptoms of the cyst. Surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment for symptomatic bronchogenic cysts.

Explanation:
The most likely diagnosis in this case is squamous cell carcinoma. The patient has a history of sarcoidosis, which is a chronic inflammatory disease that can predispose to the development of malignancy. The patient also presents with progressive supraclavicular, facial, and mandibular swelling, which is consistent with a malignancy of the head and neck. The physical examination findings of a fixed mass in the left preauricular space, expanding into the temporomandibular joint area and zygoma, are also consistent with a malignancy of the head and neck. The imaging findings of a 3.2 × 4.4 × 2.8-cm lobulated enhancing paramandibular mass extending into the left masticator space and infratemporal fossa, with frank erosion of the left mandibular condyle, are also consistent with a malignancy of the head and neck. The positron emission tomography findings of a large metabolically active left masticator space mass (standardized uptake value for body weight at maximum counts per pixel [SUVmax], 18.2) and previously mentioned pathologic nodes are also consistent with a malignancy of the head and neck.

Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common malignancy of the head and neck, accounting for approximately 90% of all cases. It is a highly aggressive tumor that can spread to regional lymph nodes and distant organs. The treatment for squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck typically involves a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.

The other possible diagnoses in this case are chondrosarcoma, adenoid cystic carcinoma, and lymphoma. However, these tumors are less common than squamous cell carcinoma and are not as likely to present with the same clinical features.

Explanation:

The patient's presentation is concerning for leprosy, a chronic, infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae. Leprosy can cause a variety of skin and nerve problems, including loss of eyebrows and eyelashes.

The most important diagnostic test for leprosy is a skin biopsy. A biopsy will allow a doctor to see the bacteria that cause leprosy and to determine the type of leprosy that the patient has.

Other tests that may be ordered include a rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test, a thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level, and a lead level. The RPR test is a blood test that can be used to screen for syphilis, another disease that can cause loss of eyebrows and eyelashes. The TSH test is a blood test that can be used to check for thyroid problems, which can also cause loss of eyebrows and eyelashes. The lead level test is a blood test that can be used to check for lead poisoning, which can also cause loss of eyebrows and eyelashes.

If the patient is diagnosed with leprosy, he will need to be treated with antibiotics. Treatment for leprosy is usually long-term, and it is important to take the antibiotics as prescribed. Treatment for leprosy can be very effective, and most patients with leprosy can live normal lives.

Empirical treatment with a topical steroid or dapsone is not recommended in this case because it would not be effective against leprosy. Topical steroids and dapsone are used to treat other skin conditions, such as eczema and psoriasis. They would not be effective against the bacteria that cause leprosy.

Empirical treatment of close contacts with dapsone is also not recommended in this case. Dapsone is a powerful medication that can have serious side effects. It is not recommended to treat people who are not infected with leprosy with dapsone.

Explanation:
Equestrian perniosis is a common condition that affects people who work with horses. It is caused by exposure to cold and wet conditions and is characterized by painful, erythematous plaques on the lower legs and thighs. The plaques are often violaceous and may have annular or circinate borders. They may also be ulcerated.

The diagnosis of equestrian perniosis is based on the history and physical examination. A biopsy is not usually necessary, but may be helpful to rule out other conditions. Treatment is aimed at preventing further exposure to cold and wet conditions. Topical corticosteroids may be helpful for relieving symptoms.

The other options are incorrect because they do not typically present with a history of exposure to cold and wet conditions. Erythema annulare centrifugum is a chronic skin condition that is characterized by annular or circinate plaques. Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus is a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect the skin, joints, and other organs.

**Explanation:**

Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare, non-infectious, inflammatory skin disease that can cause painful, rapidly spreading ulcers. It is often associated with underlying medical conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and hematologic malignancies.

In this case, the patient's history of rheumatoid arthritis, as well as the appearance of the ulcers (painful, gradually expanding ulcers with central ulceration that expressed a straw-colored fluid), are consistent with a diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum. The fact that the patient failed a course of amoxicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethaxazole, which are antibiotics, suggests that the ulcers are not caused by an infection. The negative fungal and bacterial culture samples further support this diagnosis.

Atypical mycobacterial infection, blastomycosis, and ecthyma gangrenosum are all infectious diseases that can cause skin ulcers. However, these diseases are less likely in a patient with a history of rheumatoid arthritis. Additionally, the appearance of the ulcers in this case is not typical of these diseases.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is pyoderma gangrenosum.

Explanation:

Plantar cerebriform collagenoma is a rare, benign, cutaneous collagenoma that typically presents as a solitary, asymptomatic, skin-colored or slightly hyperpigmented plaque on the plantar surface of the foot. The plaque is often well-demarcated and has a cobblestoned or cerebriform appearance. Histologically, plantar cerebriform collagenoma is characterized by a proliferation of thick, eosinophilic collagen bundles arranged in a cerebriform pattern. The differential diagnosis for plantar cerebriform collagenoma includes pseudolymphoma, elephantiasis nostras verrucosa, and nodular amyloid.

Pseudolymphoma is a benign, inflammatory condition that can mimic a lymphoma. It typically presents as a solitary, erythematous, indurated plaque on the skin. Histologically, pseudolymphoma is characterized by a dense infiltrate of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and eosinophils.

Elephantiasis nostras verrucosa is a chronic, inflammatory condition that is characterized by the development of verrucous lesions on the skin. It is most commonly associated with infection with the bacterium Mycobacterium marinum. Histologically, elephantiasis nostras verrucosa is characterized by a dense infiltrate of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages.

Nodular amyloid is a rare, benign, cutaneous amyloidosis that typically presents as a solitary, asymptomatic, skin-colored or slightly hyperpigmented plaque on the skin. The plaque is often well-demarcated and has a nodular appearance. Histologically, nodular amyloid is characterized by the deposition of amyloid fibrils in the dermis.

In the case presented, the patient is a man in his 60s with diabetes who has an asymptomatic, shiny indurated plaque on the right plantar foot. The plaque has been slowly growing for the past year. The patient has no fevers, chills, weight loss, or night sweats. He has long-standing, intermittent dyspnea on exertion, but no baseline shortness of breath, orthopnea, or bilateral lower extremity edema. The patient has occasional numbness in both legs in stocking distribution, attributed to diabetic neuropathy. Physical examination reveals a 4.5 cm waxy, nontender, smooth-surfaced, cobblestoned plaque located in the sulcus between the second and fourth toes. A biopsy specimen obtained by the patient’s podiatrist was sent to the dermatopathology laboratory for review. The histopathology report shows a diffuse infiltrate of pale eosinophilic material with prominent clefts. Congo red staining is negative.

Based on the clinical presentation and histopathology findings, the most likely diagnosis is plantar cerebriform collagenoma. The other possible diagnoses (pseudolymphoma, elephantiasis nostras verrucosa, and nodular amyloid) are less likely given the patient's history and physical examination findings.

HSP is a small vessel vasculitis that typically affects children and young adults. It is characterized by a triad of abdominal pain, arthritis, and a characteristic skin rash called purpura. The rash is usually seen on the lower extremities and buttocks, and it is caused by bleeding into the skin.

The diagnosis of HSP is based on the clinical presentation and the results of laboratory tests. Laboratory tests may show anemia, leukocytosis, and elevated levels of inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate.

The treatment of HSP is supportive. Patients are usually given bed rest and pain medication. In some cases, steroids may be given to reduce inflammation.

The prognosis of HSP is good. Most patients recover completely within a few weeks. However, in some cases, HSP can lead to serious complications such as kidney disease.

The following are the reasons why the other options are incorrect:

* Leukemia is a cancer of the blood cells. It is not characterized by a rash, arthritis, or abdominal pain.

The patient has abdominal pain for 5 days, with no radiation. He did not have bowel movements for 5 days but passed gas normally. He did not complain of nausea or vomiting. He denied substance abuse or addiction. The abdomen was soft with hypogastric tenderness. There was no abdominal distension, guarding, or rebound tenderness. Neither hernia nor surgical scars were seen on examination, and vital signs and results from laboratory tests were normal. An axial contrast computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen was performed, which did not show abnormal intestinal air-fluid levels nor free peritoneal air. However, the CT scan revealed that the rectum was not empty.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of gastrointestinal obstruction due to adhesion band. Adhesion bands are bands of fibrous tissue that can form after surgery or an infection. They can cause obstruction by trapping or compressing the intestines. The patient's history of abdominal pain and lack of bowel movements are consistent with this diagnosis. The CT scan findings of a non-empty rectum and no abnormal intestinal air-fluid levels further support this diagnosis.

The other possible diagnoses are not as likely in this case. Gastrointestinal obstruction due to internal hernia is less likely because the patient does not have any risk factors for this condition, such as a history of surgery or a hernia. Body packing is also less likely because the patient does not have any history of drug abuse. Fecal impaction due to opium addiction is also less likely because the patient does not have any history of substance abuse.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is gastrointestinal obstruction due to adhesion band.

 66%|██████▌   | 1008/1525 [3:50:50<1:42:08, 11.85s/it]The correct answer is D. Nodular melanoma.

Cavernous lymphangioma is a benign tumor of lymphatic tissue. It is characterized by multiple, dilated lymphatic channels filled with lymph. It is usually a small, painless mass that is found on the skin of the extremities.

Nodular basal cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that starts in the basal cells, which are the cells that produce the epidermis, the outermost layer of skin. It is the most common type of skin cancer, and it is usually a slow-growing, non-cancerous tumor. However, it can spread to other parts of the body if it is not treated.

Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that starts in the squamous cells, which are the cells that make up the upper layer of the epidermis. It is the second most common type of skin cancer, and it is more likely to spread to other parts of the body than basal cell carcinoma.

Nodular melanoma is the most serious type of skin cancer. It starts in the melanocytes, which are the cells that produce melanin, the pigment that gives skin its color. It is a fast-growing cancer that can spread to other parts of the body very quickly.

The patient in the case presented with a rapidly growing, bleeding mass on his back. The mass was purplish and fungating, which are characteristic of melanoma. The patient also had a palpable, hard mass in the left axilla, which is a common site for metastasis from melanoma. The punch biopsy of the back mass revealed immunohistochemistry strongly positive for S-100, MART-1, and HMB-45, which are all markers of melanoma. The computed tomographic and positron emission tomographic scans demonstrated a fludeoxyglucose-avid lesion on the back extending into the subcutaneous fat and fludeoxyglucose-avid uptake in the left axilla, which are also consistent with melanoma.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is nodular melanoma.

The patient has a diffuse 90% to 95% narrowing of the left main coronary artery at its origin, which is a life-threatening condition. The left main coronary artery supplies blood to the left ventricle, which is the main pumping chamber of the heart. If this artery is blocked, the left ventricle will not get enough blood, and the patient could have a heart attack or sudden cardiac death.

Emergent stenting of the left main coronary artery is the best treatment for this condition. A stent is a small metal tube that is inserted into the narrowed artery to keep it open. This procedure is usually performed in the cardiac catheterization laboratory.

The other options are not appropriate for this patient. Coronary artery bypass graft surgery is a major surgery that is not necessary in this case. Closure of the atrial septal defect is a procedure that is used to treat a heart defect that allows blood to flow from the left atrium to the right atrium. This is not the patient's problem. Emergent pulmonic valve balloon valvotomy is a procedure that is used to treat a narrowing of the pulmonic valve. This is not the patient's problem either.

Explanation:

The patient presented with sudden voice change, odynophagia, and left-sided neck pain following a single sneeze. He experienced a popping sensation during the sneeze followed by neck stiffness 15 minutes later. He did not have associated shortness of breath, hemoptysis, or other pertinent medical history. He had no history of trauma, surgery, or intubation. On physical examination, his vital signs were stable with normal oxygen saturation on room air. His voice was rough and without stridor. Anterior neck examination revealed tenderness over the thyroid notch and left side of the laryngotracheal complex. There was no palpable crepitus. Flexible laryngoscopy was performed, which showed hematoma of the left true vocal fold and laryngeal surface of the epiglottis with normal vocal fold movement and complete glottic closure.

A ruptured vocal fold hemangioma is a rare but well-described entity. It typically presents with sudden onset of hoarseness, pain, and dysphagia. The diagnosis is made by laryngoscopy, which shows a hematoma of the vocal fold. Treatment is usually conservative, with voice rest and steroids. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the hemangioma.

The other options are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's presentation. A ruptured laryngocele is a rare condition that occurs when a cyst on the vocal fold ruptures. It typically presents with sudden onset of hoarseness, pain, and dysphagia. The diagnosis is made by laryngoscopy, which shows a cyst on the vocal fold. Treatment is usually conservative, with voice rest and steroids. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the cyst. A thyroid cartilage fracture is a rare condition that occurs when the thyroid cartilage is injured. It typically presents with pain, swelling, and ecchymosis in the neck. The diagnosis is made by CT scan or MRI. Treatment is usually conservative, with rest and immobilization of the neck. Traumatic intubation is a rare condition that occurs when the endotracheal tube is inserted into the airway too forcefully. It typically presents with hoarseness, pain, and dysphagia. The diagnosis is made by laryngoscopy. Treatment is usually conservative, with voice rest and steroids.

Explanation:
The patient has objective tinnitus, intermittent clicking, and no hearing loss. The CT scan shows a persistent stapedial artery, which is a small blood vessel that runs between the internal carotid artery and the stapes bone in the middle ear. This artery is normally present in fetuses but usually regresses by birth. In some cases, it can persist into adulthood and can cause tinnitus. The other options are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms. A paraganglioma is a tumor that can grow near the ear and can cause tinnitus, but it is usually associated with hearing loss. A cholesteatoma is a growth of skin cells in the middle ear that can cause hearing loss and infection. A dehiscent carotid canal is a condition in which the wall of the carotid canal, which houses the internal carotid artery, is thin or perforated. This can cause tinnitus, but it is usually associated with other symptoms, such as pain in the face or neck.

Explanation:

A superior laryngeal nerve schwannoma is a benign tumor that arises from the Schwann cells that myelinate the superior laryngeal nerve. It is the most common type of nerve sheath tumor in the head and neck. Schwannomas are typically slow-growing tumors that present with symptoms related to compression of the nerve, such as hoarseness, dysphagia, and neck pain. The diagnosis is made with imaging studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and confirmed with biopsy. Treatment is surgical excision.

The patient in this case presented with a cervical tracheal mass measuring 1.6 × 1.3 cm found incidentally on MRI for cervical spine pain. She had not experienced dyspnea, hoarseness, dysphagia, hemoptysis, or chest pain. Flexible fiber-optic nasolaryngoscopy demonstrated a smooth hypervascular mass arising from the posterior membranous trachea. The patient underwent tracheostomy and complete excision via a transtracheal approach. The patient was decannulated on postoperative day 5. Histopathologic images showed a well-circumscribed, encapsulated tumor composed of spindle cells with Antoni A and Antoni B areas. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for S-100 protein and negative for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of superior laryngeal nerve schwannoma.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the clinical presentation and imaging findings in this case. Carcinoid tumors are typically neuroendocrine tumors that present with symptoms related to hormone production, such as flushing, diarrhea, and wheezing. Glomus tumors are typically small, benign tumors that arise from the glomus body, a small structure that regulates blood flow. Paragangliomas are typically neuroendocrine tumors that arise from the paraganglia, small clusters of cells that regulate blood pressure.

 66%|██████▋   | 1013/1525 [3:51:49<1:47:53, 12.64s/it]The correct answer is: A. Squamous papilloma.

Explanation:

Squamous papillomas are the most common type of esophageal polyps, accounting for up to 80% of cases. They are usually benign and asymptomatic, but can occasionally cause bleeding or dysphagia. They are typically small, pedunculated lesions that arise from the squamous epithelium of the esophagus. On endoscopy, they appear as smooth, white or pink polyps. Histologically, they are composed of well-differentiated squamous epithelium with a fibrovascular core.

The other options are incorrect because:

* Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are rare, mesenchymal tumors that can arise from any part of the gastrointestinal tract. They are usually malignant, and can cause bleeding, obstruction, or perforation. On endoscopy, they appear as submucosal masses that can be ulcerated or necrotic. Histologically, they are composed of spindle cells that express the c-kit protein.
* Fibrovascular polyps are rare, benign lesions that can arise from any part of the gastrointestinal tract. They are usually asymptomatic, but can occasionally cause bleeding or obstruction. On endoscopy, they appear as small, sessile lesions that arise from the submucosa. Histologically, they are composed of fibrous tissue and blood vessels.
* Lipomas are rare, benign tumors that are composed of mature fat cells. They can arise from any part of the body, including the esophagus. They are usually asymptomatic, but can occasionally cause bleeding or obstruction. On endoscopy, they appear as smooth, yellow polyps. Histologically, they are composed of mature adipocytes.

The patient has a history of hypercholesterolemia, which is a risk factor for coronary artery disease (CAD). The patient also has unilateral vision loss, which could be a sign of amaurosis fugax, a transient loss of vision caused by a blockage in the blood supply to the retina. Amaurosis fugax is a common symptom of CAD, and it is important to rule out this condition as the cause of the patient's vision loss.

A carotid Doppler is a test that can be used to assess blood flow in the carotid arteries. The carotid arteries are the major arteries that supply blood to the brain. A carotid Doppler can be used to detect blockages in the carotid arteries, which can be a cause of CAD.

A cardiologist is a doctor who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of heart disease. If the patient is found to have CAD, the cardiologist will be able to recommend treatment options. Treatment for CAD may include lifestyle changes, medication, or surgery.

The other options are not correct. Option A, "Observe," is not correct because the patient has a history of hypercholesterolemia and unilateral vision loss. These are risk factors for CAD, and it is important to rule out CAD as the cause of the patient's vision loss. Option B, "Perform panretinal photocoagulation," is not correct because panretinal photocoagulation is a treatment for diabetic retinopathy, not CRVO. Option C, "Obtain carotid Doppler," is correct, but it is not the only appropriate action. The patient should also be referred to a cardiologist for further evaluation.

 67%|██████▋   | 1015/1525 [3:52:21<2:02:41, 14.43s/it]The answer is C: Observe.

The patient is a 50-year-old African American woman with recent-onset bilateral blurred vision. She has a history of hypertension, asthma, hepatitis C, and essential tremor. She is currently taking lisinopril, albuterol sulfate, and amantadine hydrochloride. She denies any previous ocular surgical procedures or trauma.

Her best-corrected visual acuity at presentation is 20/70 OD and 20/50 OS. Her extraocular motility, pupils, and confrontation visual fields are normal. Intraocular pressures are 7 and 9 mm Hg OD and OS, respectively. An anterior segment slitlamp examination is significant for central bilateral stromal edema, Descemet folds, microcystic edema, and endothelial guttae in both eyes. There were no keratic precipitates, and the anterior chamber did not show cells or flare. Conjunctiva was white and quiet. No abnormalities were noted during an ophthalmoscopic examination. Her central corneal thickness was found to be 833 μm OD and 925 μm OS.

The most likely diagnosis is Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy. This is a degenerative disorder of the corneal endothelium that can lead to corneal edema, visual impairment, and even blindness. The condition is typically bilateral and slowly progressive. There is no cure for Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy, but treatment can help to slow the progression of the disease and improve vision. Treatment options include topical medications, laser therapy, and corneal transplantation.

In this case, the patient's best-corrected visual acuity is only 20/70 in both eyes. However, her central corneal thickness is only 833 μm OD and 925 μm OS, which is within the normal range. This suggests that the patient's corneal edema is not severe enough to warrant immediate treatment. Therefore, the most appropriate course of action is to observe the patient and monitor her condition closely. If the patient's vision worsens or her corneal edema becomes more severe, then treatment may be necessary.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Bilateral Descemet stripping endothelial keratoplasty (DSEK) is a surgical procedure that is used to treat severe corneal edema. However, this procedure is not necessary in this case, as the patient's corneal edema is not severe enough to warrant surgery. Corneal topography is a diagnostic test that is used to map the surface of the cornea. This test is not necessary in this case, as the patient's corneal edema is already visible on slitlamp examination. Discontinuation of amantadine is not likely to improve the patient's condition, as amantadine is not a known cause of Fuchs' endothelial dystrophy.

 67%|██████▋   | 1016/1525 [3:52:37<2:05:45, 14.82s/it]The correct answer is: A. Perform a biopsy of the mass.

The patient has a periorbital mass that is refractory to outpatient management. This suggests that the mass is likely malignant. A biopsy is the only way to definitively diagnose the mass and determine the best course of treatment.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans can be used to image the mass and help determine its size, location, and extent. However, these scans cannot provide a definitive diagnosis of the mass.

Endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy is a surgical procedure that is used to treat obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct. This procedure is not indicated for the patient in this case, as she does not have obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct.

Prescribing topical and systemic antibiotics and recommending use of warm compresses without planned surgical or procedural intervention is not appropriate for the patient in this case, as her symptoms have persisted and eventually worsened despite treatment with oral antibiotics.

Therefore, the correct answer is: A. Perform a biopsy of the mass.

The patient has a history of postconcussion syndrome and has been experiencing progressive vision loss for 2 years. She has also developed new balance difficulties and worsening dysarthria. These symptoms are concerning for a demyelinating disorder, such as multiple sclerosis. Multiple sclerosis is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including vision loss, numbness, tingling, weakness, fatigue, and balance problems.

An MRI of the brain/orbits with contrast is the most appropriate test to order in this patient. This test can help to visualize the white matter lesions that are characteristic of multiple sclerosis. If the MRI is positive, it can confirm the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis and help to guide treatment.

Genetic testing, lumbar puncture, and audiogram are not appropriate tests to order in this patient. Genetic testing is not necessary to diagnose multiple sclerosis, as it is a clinical diagnosis. Lumbar puncture is not necessary to diagnose multiple sclerosis, as the cerebrospinal fluid findings are usually normal in patients with this disease. Audiogram is not necessary to diagnose multiple sclerosis, as hearing loss is not a common symptom of this disease.

In conclusion, the patient should undergo an MRI of the brain/orbits with contrast to evaluate for multiple sclerosis.

Explanation:

The patient is a woman in her 70s who presented with multiple thick, mildly pruritic, yellow hyperkeratotic plaques on her lower extremities. She was taking pembrolizumab, a checkpoint inhibitor, for the treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.

Pembrolizumab works by blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway, which is involved in the suppression of the immune system. This can lead to the development of autoimmune reactions, including skin rashes.

Hypertrophic lichen planus is a chronic, inflammatory skin condition that is characterized by thick, warty plaques. It is often associated with other autoimmune conditions, such as psoriasis and lupus.

The clinical presentation of the patient is consistent with hypertrophic lichen planus. The biopsy results also show bandlike lymphocytic infiltration, which is a characteristic finding of lichen planus.

The other options are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation or the biopsy results.

Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that is not typically associated with pembrolizumab. Plaque psoriasis is a chronic, autoimmune skin condition that is characterized by red, scaly patches. Keratoacanthoma is a type of skin cancer that is typically self-limiting.

Refractory CDI is defined as CDI that fails to resolve after two or more courses of standard therapy. In this case, the patient had a previous episode of CDI that was successfully treated with metronidazole. However, he presented 6 weeks later with recurrent diarrhea and a positive stool test for C difficile toxin. This suggests that he has refractory CDI.

Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is a treatment option for refractory CDI. It involves transplanting stool from a healthy donor into the colon of a patient with CDI. FMT has been shown to be effective in treating refractory CDI, with cure rates of up to 90%.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Diagnose recurrent Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and prescribe metronidazole. This is not the correct diagnosis, as the patient has refractory CDI. Metronidazole is not effective in treating refractory CDI.
* Option B: Diagnose severe CDI and prescribe vancomycin. This is not the correct diagnosis, as the patient does not have severe CDI. Severe CDI is defined as CDI that is associated with one or more of the following: fever, leukocytosis, hypotension, or ileus. The patient in this case does not have any of these features.
* Option C: Diagnose postinfectious altered bowel habits with C difficile colonization and recommend a high-fiber diet. This is not the correct diagnosis, as the patient has refractory CDI. Postinfectious altered bowel habits are a condition that can occur after a bout of CDI. They are characterized by persistent diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, and bloating. The patient in this case does not have any of these features.

Explanation: Blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by multiple, soft, blue papules or nodules that are often painful. The lesions are typically found on the skin, but they can also occur in other organs, such as the gastrointestinal tract, bladder, and brain. The cause of blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome is unknown, but it is thought to be a congenital disorder. There is no cure for blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome, but treatment can help to relieve the pain and improve the quality of life. Treatment options include surgery to remove the lesions, laser therapy, and medication to control the pain.

The other options are incorrect because they do not describe the clinical presentation of the patient in the case. Venous malformations are characterized by dilated veins that can be superficial or deep. Hemangiomas are benign tumors of blood vessels that can be present at birth or develop later in life.

Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome (BHD) is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple benign tumors, including fibrofolliculomas, trichodiscomas, and acrochordons. The disorder is caused by mutations in the folliculin gene, which is located on chromosome 17q21.

The clinical features of BHD vary widely from person to person. Some individuals may have only a few skin lesions, while others may have hundreds. The lesions are typically asymptomatic, but they can be cosmetically disfiguring. In some cases, BHD can also lead to the development of more serious complications, such as kidney stones, lung tumors, and brain tumors.

The diagnosis of BHD is made based on a person's medical history and a physical examination. A biopsy of one of the skin lesions can also be helpful in making the diagnosis. There is no cure for BHD, but treatment can help to control the symptoms and prevent complications. Treatment options include surgery to remove the skin lesions, laser therapy, and medications to prevent kidney stones.

The patient in the case described above presents with multiple facial papules that have been present since childhood. The papules are smooth, skin-colored to erythematous, and asymmetrical in distribution. The patient also has a family history of the disorder, as her brother has the same skin lesions. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of BHD.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation. Hereditary progressive mucinous histiocytosis is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the accumulation of mucinous material in the skin and other organs. Multiple eruptive dermatofibromas is a rare skin condition characterized by the sudden appearance of multiple dermatofibromas, which are benign tumors of the skin.

CADASIL is a rare, inherited disorder that affects the blood vessels in the brain. It is caused by a mutation in the NOTCH3 gene, which is responsible for producing a protein that helps to regulate the growth and development of blood vessels.

CADASIL typically presents in adults in their 30s or 40s with a history of migraine headaches, followed by progressive cognitive decline, memory loss, and stroke-like episodes.

The diagnosis of CADASIL is made based on a combination of clinical features, family history, and genetic testing. There is no cure for CADASIL, but treatment can help to manage the symptoms and improve quality of life.

The MRI findings in this case are consistent with CADASIL. The multiple abnormal signals throughout the brain on T1-, T2-, and susceptibility-weighted sequences (SWIs) are characteristic of CADASIL. The lesion at the level of the fifth cervical vertebra is also consistent with CADASIL, as CADASIL can affect the spinal cord as well as the brain.

Amyloid angiopathy is a condition that causes the accumulation of amyloid plaques in the blood vessels of the brain. Amyloid plaques can lead to bleeding in the brain, which can cause stroke-like symptoms. However, the MRI findings in this case are not consistent with amyloid angiopathy.

Multiple cavernous malformations are small, abnormal blood vessels that can occur throughout the body, including the brain. Cavernous malformations can bleed, which can cause stroke-like symptoms. However, the MRI findings in this case are not consistent with multiple cavernous malformations.

Metastatic melanoma is a type of cancer that can spread from the skin to the brain. Metastatic melanoma can cause stroke-like symptoms, but the MRI findings in this case are not consistent with metastatic melanoma.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is CADASIL.

Explanation:

Herpes zoster, also known as shingles, is a viral disease characterized by a painful skin rash with blisters in a limited area on one side of the body, often in a stripe. The initial infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV) causes the acute (short-lived) illness chickenpox which generally occurs in children and young adults. Once an episode of chickenpox has resolved, the virus is not eliminated from the body but can go on to cause shingles—an illness with very different symptoms—often many years after the initial infection.

The most common symptom of shingles is a painful skin rash that appears as a cluster of blisters on one side of the body. The rash usually starts on the trunk and then spreads to the face, arms, or legs. The blisters may be itchy or painful, and they may crust over and scab over.

Shingles is caused by the varicella zoster virus, which is the same virus that causes chickenpox. Once a person has chickenpox, the virus stays in their body for the rest of their life. It can become active again years later and cause shingles.

Shingles is more common in older adults and people who have weakened immune systems. It is also more common in people who have had chickenpox as an adult.

There is no cure for shingles, but there are treatments that can help relieve the symptoms. Treatment usually includes antiviral medications and pain relievers.

The rash in this case is most consistent with herpes zoster. The lesions are discrete clusters of monomorphic pink to violaceous papulovesicles with surrounding erythema, which is the classic presentation of shingles. The patient also has a history of chickenpox, which is a risk factor for developing shingles. The other options are less likely given the patient's presentation. Microcystic lymphatic malformation is a rare congenital disorder of the lymphatic system that typically presents with multiple small, soft, compressible masses. Eczema herpeticum is a secondary infection of eczema with the herpes simplex virus that can present with a similar rash, but the patient in this case does not have a history of eczema. Hypersensitivity reaction is a broad term that can refer to a variety of allergic reactions, none of which are consistent with the patient's presentation.

The patient is a man in his 30s who presents with a 2-year history of worsening abdominal discomfort, a large recurrent umbilical hernia, and weight loss. He also has night sweats and bilateral lower extremity edema. On examination, he has a palpable left-sided abdominal mass. Laboratory evaluation reveals anemia, leukocytosis, and hyponatremia. A bone marrow biopsy specimen shows a hypercellular marrow with a myeloid left shift but no increase in blasts or dyspoiesis. Tests for BCR/ABL and peripheral blood JAK2 mutation are negative. Computed tomography reveals splenomegaly, hydronephrosis, and a 25-cm left-sided retroperitoneal mass.

The differential diagnosis for a large retroperitoneal mass includes a variety of benign and malignant conditions. The most common benign conditions include lipomas, lymphangiomas, and neurofibromas. The most common malignant conditions include lymphoma, sarcoma, and germ cell tumors.

The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of lymphoma. The patient's age, gender, and smoking history are all risk factors for lymphoma. The patient's abdominal discomfort, weight loss, and night sweats are all common symptoms of lymphoma. The patient's anemia, leukocytosis, and hyponatremia are all non-specific findings that can be seen in a variety of hematologic disorders, including lymphoma. The bone marrow biopsy specimen shows a hypercellular marrow with a myeloid left shift, which is a common finding in lymphoma. Tests for BCR/ABL and peripheral blood JAK2 mutation are negative, which helps to rule out chronic myeloid leukemia and polycythemia vera, respectively. The computed tomography findings reveal a large retroperitoneal mass that encases the left kidney, which is a common finding in lymphoma.

The patient's diagnosis of lymphoma is confirmed by a lymph node biopsy. The patient is treated with chemotherapy and radiation therapy. He has a good response to treatment and is currently in remission.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely in this patient. Adrenocortical carcinoma is a rare malignancy that typically presents with symptoms of Cushing's syndrome, such as weight gain, hypertension, and muscle weakness. Liposarcoma is a rare soft tissue sarcoma that typically presents as a painless mass in the extremities. Lymphoma is a more common diagnosis than adrenocortical carcinoma or liposarcoma in a patient with a large retroperitoneal mass. Leiomyosarcoma is a rare soft tissue sarcoma that typically presents as a painless mass in the abdomen or pelvis.

Explanation:

Cecal volvulus is a condition in which the cecum, the lower right part of the large intestine, twists on itself. This can cut off the blood supply to the cecum and cause it to become obstructed.

The patient in the case presented with acute-onset, diffuse abdominal pain for 24 hours accompanied by nausea and retching. She had no significant medical history and no prior abdominal surgery. In the emergency department, she was afebrile with stable vital signs. Results of her abdominal examination revealed a slight distension and diffuse tenderness to palpation, particularly in the epigastrium and right upper quadrant, but no peritoneal signs. Results of laboratory tests were unremarkable except for mild leukocytosis. Abdominopelvic computed tomography revealed a distended cecum in the left upper quadrant.

All of the answer choices are possible causes of abdominal pain, but cecal volvulus is the most likely diagnosis in this case. The patient's symptoms and the findings on her physical examination and imaging studies are consistent with cecal volvulus.

Cecal volvulus is a surgical emergency. The treatment is to untwist the cecum and to remove any dead or dying tissue. The prognosis is good if the cecal volvulus is treated promptly.

Explanation:
The patient has bilateral papilledema, which is a sign of increased intracranial pressure. The most common cause of increased intracranial pressure in young adults is a brain tumor. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits is the most sensitive test to detect a brain tumor. Lumbar puncture with opening pressure is also a useful test to measure intracranial pressure, but it is not as sensitive as MRI for detecting a brain tumor. B-scan ultrasonography or fundus autofluorescence imaging of optic nerves are not specific tests for brain tumors and are not recommended in the initial evaluation of a patient with papilledema. Admitting the patient and consulting neuro-ophthalmology are appropriate steps if the patient has severe papilledema or if there are other signs or symptoms that suggest a serious underlying cause.

Explanation:

The patient has a history of bilateral recurrent gingivitis with persistent reactive lymphadenopathy of the head and neck unresponsive to treatment with systemic antibiotics. He also has bilateral hypopyons, which are inflammatory cells in the anterior chamber of the eye. The most likely cause of this patient's bilateral hypopyons is a non-infectious inflammatory condition, such as sarcoidosis. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disorder characterized by the formation of non-caseating granulomas in various organs, including the eyes. The diagnosis of sarcoidosis is made by biopsy of affected tissue, such as an iris nodule. In this case, a biopsy of the iris nodule would be the most appropriate next step in the evaluation and management of the patient.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option B: Lymph node biopsy is not indicated in this case because the patient's lymphadenopathy is likely secondary to his sarcoidosis.
* Option C: Intravitreal vancomycin and ceftrazidime are antibiotics that would be used to treat an infectious cause of hypopyon, such as endophthalmitis. However, there is no evidence that the patient has an infectious cause of his hypopyons.
* Option D: Obtaining bacterial and fungal blood cultures is not indicated in this case because the patient's hypopyons are most likely due to a non-infectious inflammatory condition.

Explanation:
The patient has a history of mitral valve replacement, previous coronary artery bypass grafting, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure. He presented to the clinic with worsening exertional dyspnea. He underwent a cardiac catheterization that demonstrated patent bypass grafts but a profoundly low cardiac output and elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed that suggested the presence of a significantly elevated gradient across his mitral prosthesis. A plain radiography of the chest demonstrated a mechanical prosthesis. A transesophageal echocardiogram was then performed that demonstrated complete immobilization of 1 mechanical leaflet and impaired excursion of the other leaflet, with subsequent severe mitral stenosis. He developed worsening hemodynamic instability and refractory pulmonary edema, and a TandemHeart left ventricular assist device was placed for cardiogenic shock.

The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with prosthetic valve thrombosis. Prosthetic valve thrombosis is a serious complication of mitral valve replacement that can lead to hemodynamic instability, heart failure, and death. The treatment of prosthetic valve thrombosis is urgent surgical valve replacement. Intravenous unfractionated heparin or thrombolysis may be used as temporizing measures, but they are not definitive treatments. Empirical antibiotics are not indicated in the absence of evidence of infection.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Obtain consultation for urgent surgical valve replacement.

 68%|██████▊   | 1030/1525 [3:55:40<1:40:05, 12.13s/it]The correct answer is: **C. Laryngocele**

Explanation:

A laryngocele is a cystic dilation of the saccule, a diverticulum of the larynx that contains mucous membrane and respiratory epithelium. It is typically located in the lateral wall of the larynx, between the thyroid cartilage and the cricoid cartilage. Laryngoceles are classified as internal, external, or mixed. Internal laryngocele are the most common type and are located within the larynx. External laryngocele are located outside the larynx and communicate with the larynx through a small opening. Mixed laryngocele are a combination of internal and external laryngocele.

The most common symptom of a laryngocele is hoarseness. Other symptoms may include a feeling of fullness in the throat, difficulty swallowing, and a cough. Laryngoceles are typically diagnosed with a physical examination and imaging studies, such as a CT scan or MRI. Treatment of a laryngocele depends on the size and symptoms of the lesion. Small, asymptomatic laryngocele may not require treatment. Larger laryngocele or those that are causing symptoms may be treated with surgery to remove the cyst.

The patient in the case presented has a history of undifferentiated insular carcinoma, which is a type of thyroid cancer. The patient underwent a substernal total thyroidectomy, which is a procedure to remove the entire thyroid gland. The patient also underwent a right central (level VI) lymph node dissection, which is a procedure to remove lymph nodes in the right central compartment of the neck. After the surgery, the patient developed a 2-cm expansile mass in the right central compartment. The mass was excised and histopathologic analysis revealed a cystic mass composed primarily of mucosal cells and sparse fibroconnective tissue. This is consistent with a diagnosis of laryngocele.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Apical lung bulla/bleb: A bulla is a large, thin-walled air-filled cavity in the lung. Blebs are smaller, less well-defined air-filled cavities in the lung. Both bullae and blebs can occur as a result of chronic lung disease, such as emphysema. However, the patient in the case presented does not have any history of lung disease. Additionally, the mass in the case presented is located in the neck, not in the lung.
* Tracheocele: A tracheocele is a herniation of the tracheal mucosa through a defect in the tracheal wall. Tracheoceles are typically located in the anterior wall of the trachea. The patient in the case presented does not have any history of trauma to the neck. Additionally, the mass in the case presented is located in the lateral wall of the larynx, not in the anterior wall of the trachea.
* Zenker diverticulum: A Zenker diverticulum is a pouch that forms in the esophagus at the base of the tongue. Zenker diverticula are typically caused by a weakness in the muscle of the esophagus. The patient in the case presented does not have any history of esophageal problems. Additionally, the mass in the case presented is located in the larynx, not in the esophagus.

Explanation:

The patient is a young infant with a history of recent-onset hoarseness in her cry, loud snoring, and some retractions during sleep. On physical examination, she has mild inspiratory stridor and several light-brown macules approximately 1 cm in size on her skin. On flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy, a supraglottic mass is seen. A biopsy specimen is sent for permanent pathologic analysis, which shows bundles of spindle cells with angulated nuclei in a stroma of variable coarse collagen and loose myxoid matrix. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of laryngeal rhabdomyosarcoma.

Laryngeal rhabdomyosarcoma is a rare pediatric malignancy, accounting for <1% of all childhood cancers. It is typically a tumor of the larynx, but it can also occur in other parts of the body, such as the extremities, trunk, and retroperitoneum. The most common presenting symptom is hoarseness, followed by stridor, dyspnea, and a neck mass. The diagnosis is made by biopsy. Treatment typically involves surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. The prognosis for children with laryngeal rhabdomyosarcoma is generally good, with a 5-year survival rate of >70%.

The other options are incorrect because they are not consistent with the patient's presentation and biopsy findings. Laryngeal sarcoid is a granulomatous disease that can affect any part of the body, including the larynx. However, it is typically a multifocal disease, and it is not associated with the presence of light-brown macules on the skin. Granular cell tumor is a benign neoplasm that can occur in any part of the body, including the larynx. It is typically a solitary mass, and it is not associated with the presence of light-brown macules on the skin. Laryngeal neurofibroma is a benign neoplasm that can occur in any part of the body, including the larynx. It is typically a solitary mass, and it is not associated with the presence of light-brown macules on the skin.

 68%|██████▊   | 1032/1525 [3:56:10<1:54:18, 13.91s/it]The correct answer is: C. Mucus retention cyst.

Explanation:

A mucus retention cyst is a cystic lesion that forms when a salivary gland duct becomes blocked. This can occur due to inflammation, infection, or trauma. The cyst is filled with mucus, which is a thick, sticky substance that is produced by the salivary glands.

The patient in the case presented with a 5-month history of right submandibular swelling and pain, associated with eating and relieved by gland massage. No saliva was expressed on examination. Computed tomography (CT) and ultrasonography showed normal-appearing submandibular glands and neck soft tissues. A sialogram showed high-grade stricture approximately 3 to 4 cm into the right submandibular duct orifice. Complete stricture prevented evaluation of the proximal duct and intraglandular portions. Sialendoscopy showed a widely patent right submandibular duct proximally with a segmental takeoff, consistent with the Bartholin duct draining into the Wharton duct distal to a blind pouch identified 2.5 cm from the intraoral duct orifice. Despite a Wharton ductoplasty to improve sublingual gland drainage through the Bartholin duct, the degree of scarring at the hilum and inability to further dilate warranted submandibular gland (SMG) excision. Four months after SMG excision, she developed a right floor of mouth lesion after “burning her mouth” with high-temperature food. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a cystic lesion in the right sublingual space following the Wharton duct. Recurrent floor of mouth swelling was addressed by repeated marsupialization and eventual sublingual gland excision. Pathologic analysis identified fragments of squamous mucosa with inflammation, cystic space, and compressed granulation tissues consistent with mucous extravasation.

The patient's history, physical examination, and imaging studies are all consistent with a diagnosis of mucus retention cyst. The patient's symptoms of swelling, pain, and difficulty swallowing are all common symptoms of mucus retention cysts. The sialogram showed a high-grade stricture of the submandibular duct, which is a common cause of mucus retention cysts. The sialendoscopy showed a widely patent duct proximal to the stricture, which is also consistent with a mucus retention cyst. The magnetic resonance imaging showed a cystic lesion in the right sublingual space, which is the location where mucus retention cysts typically occur. The pathologic analysis showed fragments of squamous mucosa with inflammation, cystic space, and compressed granulation tissues, which are all consistent with a diagnosis of mucus retention cyst.

The other possible diagnoses are not as likely in this case. A submandibular duct sialocele is a cystic lesion that forms when a salivary gland duct ruptures. This can occur due to trauma, infection, or inflammation. The patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with a diagnosis of submandibular duct sialocele. A lymphangioma is a benign tumor of lymphatic tissue. This tumor can occur anywhere in the body, but it is most common in the head and neck region. The patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with a diagnosis of lymphangioma. An abscess is a localized collection of pus that forms when an infection is not treated. The patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with a diagnosis of abscess.

 68%|██████▊   | 1033/1525 [3:56:27<2:00:00, 14.64s/it]The answer is **D. Necrotic epiglottitis**.

Necrotizing epiglottitis is a rare, life-threatening infection of the epiglottis, a flap of tissue that covers the windpipe. It is most common in children under 3 years old, but can occur in adults, especially those with underlying medical conditions such as ulcerative colitis.

The most common symptoms of necrotizing epiglottitis are fever, sore throat, dysphagia, and stridor (a high-pitched whistling sound when breathing). The patient may also have drooling, a muffled voice, and a fever of 103°F or higher.

The diagnosis of necrotizing epiglottitis is made based on the patient's history and physical examination. A lateral neck X-ray may show an enlarged epiglottis, but this is not always reliable. A flexible fiberoptic laryngoscopy is the most definitive way to diagnose the condition.

Necrotizing epiglottitis is a medical emergency. Treatment typically involves hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics. In severe cases, intubation or tracheotomy may be necessary to prevent airway obstruction.

The mortality rate from necrotizing epiglottitis has decreased significantly in recent years due to early diagnosis and treatment. However, the condition can still be fatal, especially in children.

Here are some reasons why the other options are incorrect:

* Candidosis is a fungal infection of the mouth and throat. It is not a life-threatening infection and can be treated with antifungal medications.
* Diphtheric laryngitis is a bacterial infection of the throat. It is a serious infection that can cause airway obstruction. However, it is not a common infection in the United States.
* Pseudomembranous epiglottitis is a bacterial infection of the epiglottis. It is a rare infection that is most common in children under 2 years old.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for the patient in the case is necrotizing epiglottitis.

The patient is presenting with a history of decreased vision and the sensation of tunnel vision, which accompanied cognitive decline for the past 2 years. He had a history of renal cell carcinoma and had undergone left nephrectomy 1 year prior with no recurrence. Prior to presentation, his evaluation included brain magnetic resonance imaging and neurologic evaluation with unremarkable results, and he was scheduled to undergo neuropsychological testing.

The patient's visual acuity is counting fingers OD, and 20/100 OS. Motility and intraocular pressures are normal. There is a right afferent pupillary defect. Examination of the right eye revealed rubeosis iridis, a clear lens, neovascularization of the optic disc, retinal vasculitis, venous sheathing, and a dusky-appearing peripheral retina. The left eye had a clear lens and a normal fundus on clinical examination. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated a mixed retinal arteritis and phlebitis with extensive retinal and choroidal nonperfusion of the right eye with both retinal and optic nerve neovascularization. The left eye demonstrated patches of active arteritis peripherally with a minimally affected posterior pole.

The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with giant cell arteritis (GCA), a systemic vasculitis that most commonly affects the medium-sized arteries of the head and neck. GCA is a serious condition that can lead to blindness if not treated promptly. The diagnosis of GCA is based on a combination of clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies.

The initial treatment for GCA is high-dose corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone. Methylprednisolone is typically given intravenously for 3-5 days, followed by a tapering dose of oral corticosteroids. In some cases, patients may also require immunosuppressive therapy, such as cyclophosphamide or azathioprine.

The patient in this case should be started on high-dose corticosteroids, such as methylprednisolone, 1 g intravenously daily. The patient should also be monitored closely for signs of improvement, such as a decrease in pain and inflammation, and a resolution of visual symptoms. If the patient does not respond to corticosteroid therapy, he may need to be treated with immunosuppressive therapy.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not the standard of care for GCA. Panretinal photocoagulation is a treatment for diabetic retinopathy, not GCA. Checking antinuclear antibodies, anticardiolipin antibodies, anti–double-stranded DNA antibodies, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, and angiotensin-converting enzyme can be helpful in the diagnosis of GCA, but they are not the treatment. Plasmapheresis is not a standard treatment for GCA.

 68%|██████▊   | 1035/1525 [3:56:52<1:50:24, 13.52s/it]The correct answer is C: Refer for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

The patient in this case has a history of pheochromocytoma, bilateral adrenal gland resection, and a pancreatic cyst. These are all associated with Von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL), which is an inherited genetic disorder that can cause a variety of tumors, including retinal angiomas. Retinal angiomas are benign tumors of the blood vessels in the retina. They can cause blurred vision, floaters, and in some cases, retinal detachment.

MRI is the most accurate test for diagnosing VHL. It can show the location and size of any tumors, as well as any damage to the brain or other organs. If the patient is found to have VHL, she will need to be monitored closely for the development of new tumors. She may also need to undergo treatment to remove any tumors that develop.

A complete blood cell count (CBC) and genetic testing are not necessary in this case. The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with VHL, and MRI is the most accurate test for diagnosing this condition. A retinal biopsy is also not necessary, as retinal angiomas are benign tumors.

Therefore, the best course of action is to refer the patient for MRI. This will help to confirm the diagnosis of VHL and determine the extent of the disease. The patient can then be monitored closely for the development of new tumors and receive treatment as needed.

The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of peripheral T-cell lymphoma after an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) who presented with 3 days of fever, weakness, and dyspnea. She was diagnosed with stage IV peripheral T-cell lymphoma 3 years prior and was initially treated with gemcitabine, vinorelbine, and doxorubicin. Her disease recurred 1 year later, and she underwent haplotype-matched allogeneic SCT 8 months prior to admission. Two months prior to admission, she developed graft-vs-host disease requiring high-dose prednisone, rituximab, and intravenous immunoglobulin. At the time of admission, she was receiving prednisone (40 mg/d) and tacrolimus for graft-vs-host disease and prophylaxis of infection with levofloxacin, valacyclovir, posaconazole, and thrice weekly dapsone. The patient lived with her family, including her son who recently had a cough. She was born in the Philippines and immigrated to the United States 3 decades prior. She denied recent travel.

On examination, her temperature was 38.3° C, pulse of 115 beats/min, blood pressure of 110/50 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 24 breaths/min, and an oxygen saturation of 90% on room air. Cardiopulmonary examination revealed tachycardia, increased work of breathing and bibasilar crackles without wheezes. Her laboratory studies revealed a white blood cell count of 4.2 × 106/mL (normal range, 3.4-10 × 106/mL), hemoglobin of 10.3 g/dL (normal range, 12-15.5 g/dL [to convert g/dL to g/L, multiply by 10]), platelets of 45 × 106/mL (normal range, 140-450 × 106/mL), and creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL (normal range, 0.5-1.0 mg/dL [to convert mg/dL to μmol/L, multiply by 88.4]). A chest radiograph demonstrated bilateral opacities without pleural effusion or pneumothorax. Initial empirical treatment included vancomycin, cefepime, azithromycin, and oseltamivir. On hospital day 2, she was intubated for hypoxemic respiratory failure. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest was performed (Figure, A) and compared with a study 2 weeks prior when she was asymptomatic (Figure, B).

A, Computed tomographic (CT) chest image obtained on admission demonstrates diffuse bilateral ground glass opacities with interlobular septal thickening. B, Computed tomographic chest image from 2 weeks prior demonstrates nearly normal lungs.

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is pneumonia caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). MRSA is a common cause of pneumonia in patients with hematologic malignancies, and it is particularly common in patients who have undergone allogeneic SCT. The patient's history of peripheral T-cell lymphoma, allogeneic SCT, and graft-vs-host disease are all risk factors for MRSA infection. The patient's clinical presentation, including fever, dyspnea, and bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph, is also consistent with MRSA pneumonia.

The initial empirical treatment for MRSA pneumonia includes vancomycin and an anti-pseudomonal beta-lactam, such as cefepime. However, in this patient, the vancomycin is not effective because the MRSA is resistant to vancomycin. The next step in treatment is to switch to a different antibiotic that is active against MRSA, such as linezolid. Linezolid is a glycylcycline antibiotic that is effective against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria, including MRSA. It is available as an oral or intravenous medication.

Linezolid is generally well-tolerated, but it can cause side effects, such as diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. It can also cause a rare but serious condition called thrombocytopenia, which is a decrease in the number of platelets in the blood. Platelets are important for blood clotting, so thrombocytopenia can increase the risk of bleeding.

In conclusion, the correct answer is: C. Switch vancomycin to linezolid for refractory methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. The patient is a 67-year-old woman with a history of peripheral T-cell lymphoma after an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) who presented with 3 days of fever, weakness, and dyspnea.

Leukemia cutis is a rare skin manifestation of leukemia. It is characterized by the infiltration of leukemic cells into the skin. The skin lesions can be papules, nodules, or plaques. They are often non-pruritic and non-tender. The diagnosis of leukemia cutis is made by skin biopsy. The treatment of leukemia cutis is with chemotherapy.

In this case, the patient has a history of relapsed acute myeloid leukemia. He has been treated with allogeneic stem cell transplantation. He is now presenting with intermittent fever and fatigue. He has two non-pruritic skin bumps on the right forearm and left calf. The skin biopsy shows a diffuse infiltration of large mononuclear cells with high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio. Immunohistochemistry staining is positive for CD4 cells and myeloperoxidase. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of leukemia cutis.

The other possible diagnoses are not as likely in this case. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus skin infection is a common skin infection. However, the patient does not have any risk factors for MRSA infection, such as recent hospitalization or exposure to a healthcare setting. Candida tropicalis is a fungal infection that can cause skin lesions. However, the patient does not have any risk factors for Candida infection, such as diabetes or immunosuppression. Disseminated coccidioidomycosis is a fungal infection that can cause skin lesions. However, the patient does not have any risk factors for coccidioidomycosis, such as exposure to the southwestern United States.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is leukemia cutis.

A mixing study is used to determine if a patient has a clotting factor inhibitor. A clotting factor inhibitor is an antibody that attacks and destroys clotting factors, which are proteins that are essential for blood clotting.

In a mixing study, the patient's plasma is mixed with normal plasma. If the patient has a clotting factor inhibitor, the clotting time of the mixed plasma will be longer than the clotting time of the normal plasma. This is because the clotting factor inhibitor will attack and destroy the clotting factors in the normal plasma.

In this case, the patient's clotting time was normal when her plasma was mixed with normal plasma. This indicates that she does not have a clotting factor inhibitor.

The other possible answers are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clotting time results.

Answer A: The patient has a common clotting factor inhibitor.

This answer is incorrect because the patient's clotting time was normal when her plasma was mixed with normal plasma. This indicates that she does not have a clotting factor inhibitor.

Answer B: The patient has an extrinsic clotting factor inhibitor.

This answer is incorrect because extrinsic clotting factor inhibitors are rare and are usually associated with autoimmune diseases. The patient in this case does not have an autoimmune disease.

Answer C: The patient has an intrinsic clotting factor inhibitor.

This answer is incorrect because intrinsic clotting factor inhibitors are usually associated with liver disease or vitamin K deficiency. The patient in this case does not have liver disease or vitamin K deficiency.

Explanation:

The patient has a long-standing history of thickened toenails, which is concerning for a chronic fungal infection. The presence of scale on the plantar surface skin and in the web spaces is also consistent with a fungal infection. However, it is important to rule out other possible causes of toenail dystrophy, such as psoriasis, lichen planus, and trauma. A diagnostic test, such as a fungal culture or biopsy, can help to confirm the diagnosis and guide treatment.

Treatment with an oral antifungal is usually recommended for chronic fungal nail infections. However, in this case, it is important to first confirm the diagnosis before starting treatment. Topical antifungals are not effective for chronic fungal nail infections. Reassuring the patient that no treatment is necessary is not appropriate in this case, as the patient has a significant history of toenail dystrophy.

 68%|██████▊   | 1040/1525 [3:57:52<1:34:00, 11.63s/it]The answer is: **C. Glomus tumor**

A glomus tumor is a benign tumor that arises from the glomus body, a small neurovascular structure located in the dermis. It is characterized by intense pain, which is often described as burning or throbbing. The pain is usually exacerbated by cold temperatures and pressure.

Glomus tumors are most common in the hands and feet, but they can occur anywhere on the body. They are more common in women than in men.

The diagnosis of a glomus tumor is usually made based on the clinical presentation and the results of a biopsy. The treatment of a glomus tumor is surgical excision.

The other options are incorrect because they do not typically cause the symptoms described in the case.

* Amelanotic melanoma is a type of skin cancer that does not produce melanin. It is the most aggressive type of melanoma. The most common symptom of melanoma is a change in the appearance of a mole.
* Onychopapilloma is a benign tumor that arises from the nail matrix. It is characterized by a small, raised lesion on the nail bed.
* Squamous cell carcinoma in situ is a type of skin cancer that is confined to the epidermis. It is the most common type of skin cancer. The most common symptom of squamous cell carcinoma in situ is a red, scaly patch on the skin.

Explanation:

Dermatosis papulosa nigra is a benign, acquired, hyperpigmented papular dermatosis that is most common in African Americans. It is characterized by the presence of small, dark brown to black papules that are typically located on the face, neck, and upper extremities. The lesions are often asymptomatic, but they may be pruritic or tender. The etiology of dermatosis papulosa nigra is unknown, but it is thought to be a variant of acanthosis nigricans. The diagnosis is made clinically, and there is no specific treatment. However, the lesions may fade spontaneously or with treatment with topical retinoids or lasers.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Superficial spreading melanoma is a type of melanoma that is characterized by a slow-growing, radial growth phase followed by a vertical growth phase. The lesions are often asymmetric and irregular in shape, and they may have multiple colors. Superficial spreading melanoma is the most common type of melanoma in Caucasians.
* Eruptive disseminated Spitz nevi is a rare, benign condition that is characterized by the sudden eruption of multiple Spitz nevi. The lesions are often small, dome-shaped, and pink or brown in color. Eruptive disseminated Spitz nevi is most common in children and young adults.
* Metastatic melanoma is a type of melanoma that has spread from the skin to other parts of the body. The most common sites of metastasis are the lymph nodes, lungs, liver, and brain. Metastatic melanoma is a serious condition with a poor prognosis.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for the patient in the case is dermatosis papulosa nigra. This is a benign, acquired, hyperpigmented papular dermatosis that is most common in African Americans. The lesions are often asymptomatic, but they may be pruritic or tender. The etiology of dermatosis papulosa nigra is unknown, but it is thought to be a variant of acanthosis nigricans. The diagnosis is made clinically, and there is no specific treatment. However, the lesions may fade spontaneously or with treatment with topical retinoids or lasers.

Verrucous hemangioma is a rare benign vascular tumor that typically presents as a solitary, verrucous plaque on the extremities. The lesion is composed of dilated capillaries and venules in the dermis and subcutis, and it may show overlying acanthosis and hyperkeratosis. The diagnosis is made on histopathologic examination, and the treatment is usually conservative with surgical excision or laser ablation reserved for symptomatic lesions.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Malignant melanoma is a malignant neoplasm of melanocytes. It typically presents as a pigmented lesion on the skin, but it may also occur in other areas of the body. The diagnosis is made on histopathologic examination, and the treatment is usually surgical excision with or without adjuvant therapy.
* Verruca vulgaris is a common viral infection of the skin that causes wart-like lesions. The lesions are typically small, raised, and rough, and they may be single or multiple. The diagnosis is usually made clinically, but a biopsy may be performed to confirm the diagnosis. The treatment is usually topical application of salicylic acid or cryotherapy.
* Angiokeratoma circumscriptum is a rare benign vascular lesion that typically presents as a solitary, red or purple papule on the extremities. The lesion is composed of dilated capillaries in the papillary dermis, and it may be associated with other vascular malformations. The diagnosis is made on histopathologic examination, and the treatment is usually conservative with surgical excision or laser ablation reserved for symptomatic lesions.

Ewing sarcoma is a rare type of cancer that usually affects the bones of the arms or legs. It is not typically seen in the spine.

Discitis is an infection of the intervertebral disc. It is usually caused by bacteria, such as Streptococcus or Staphylococcus.

Pyogenic osteomyelitis is an infection of the bone. It is usually caused by bacteria, such as Streptococcus or Staphylococcus.

Tuberculous spondylitis is a type of infection that affects the spine. It is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is the most common type of spinal infection in children.

The patient in this case has a history of asthma and constipation. These are both risk factors for tuberculosis. The patient also has a white blood cell count of 6.2 × 103/µL, which is elevated. This suggests that the patient has an infection. The patient also has a chest radiograph that reveals a right paravertebral mass, destruction of left seventh rib, a compression fracture of T8, and bony erosion of L1 vertebra. A computed tomographic (CT) scan reveals paravertebral abscesses with T8 compression and destruction. These findings are consistent with tuberculous spondylitis.

Thymolipoma is a rare, benign tumor that arises from the thymus gland. It is composed of both fat and thymic tissue. Thymomas are more common than thymolipomas, and they are usually malignant. Mediastinal lipomatosis is a condition in which there is an abnormal accumulation of fat in the mediastinum, the space between the lungs. Myelolipomas are rare, benign tumors that arise from the bone marrow. They are composed of both fat and hematopoietic tissue.

The patient in the case presentation is a man in his 40s who presented with new-onset progressive dizziness, lightheadedness, and shortness of breath. His medical and family history as well as review of other systems were unremarkable. Physical examination revealed a positive Kussmaul sign and pulsus paradoxus but no cardiac murmurs. There was no pedal edema, clubbing, or cyanosis. An electrocardiogram demonstrated sinus tachycardia. Results of a complete blood cell count and biochemical panel were within reference ranges. A chest radiograph revealed convexity on the right heart border suggestive of cardiomegaly. Echocardiography demonstrated normal cardiac chambers and valves. However, an echogenicity was noted compressing the superior vena cava and right ventricle. The patient subsequently underwent computed tomographic imaging of the chest that revealed a large, 16.2 × 6.8 × 5.6-cm anterior mediastinal mass compressing the right cardiac structures, particularly the superior vena cava. The mass consisted mostly of fat attenuation, but was interspersed with nodular densities. Tumor marker levels, including α-fetoprotein, lactate dehydrogenase, and β-human chorionic gonadotropin, were within reference ranges.

The patient's presentation and imaging findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of thymolipoma. Thymolipomas are typically asymptomatic, but they can cause symptoms if they grow large enough to compress surrounding structures. The most common symptoms of thymolipoma are chest pain, dyspnea, and superior vena cava syndrome. Thymolipomas are usually diagnosed on imaging studies, such as a chest radiograph or computed tomography scan. The diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy. Thymolipomas are benign tumors, and they do not require treatment unless they are causing symptoms. Treatment options for symptomatic thymolipomas include surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's presentation and imaging findings as well as thymolipoma does. Thymoma is a malignant tumor that can cause symptoms similar to those of thymolipoma, but it is more likely to be associated with other symptoms, such as fever, night sweats, and weight loss. Mediastinal lipomatosis is a condition in which there is an abnormal accumulation of fat in the mediastinum. It is usually asymptomatic, but it can cause symptoms if the mass grows large enough to compress surrounding structures. Myelolipomas are rare, benign tumors that arise from the bone marrow. They are composed of both fat and hematopoietic tissue. They are usually asymptomatic, but they can cause symptoms if the mass grows large enough to compress surrounding structures.

The patient underwent embolization of a right colic artery branch, which resulted in ischemia of the right colon. This ischemia led to the formation of intraluminal old blood, which caused a prolonged ileus. The other answers are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms.

Right colon ischemia is a common complication of angiography and embolization. It is caused by occlusion of the blood supply to the right colon, which can lead to necrosis and perforation of the colon. The patient's symptoms of abdominal pain, abdominal distension, vomiting, and significant right lower quadrant tenderness are consistent with right colon ischemia.

Endoscopic perforation is a rare complication of colonoscopy. It is caused by the perforation of the colon wall by the endoscope. The patient's symptoms do not suggest that he has an endoscopic perforation.

Diverticular perforation is a common complication of diverticulosis. It is caused by the rupture of a diverticulum, which is a small sac that projects from the wall of the colon. The patient's symptoms do not suggest that he has a diverticular perforation.

Prolonged ileus secondary to retained intraluminal old blood is a common complication of lower gastrointestinal bleeding. It is caused by the presence of blood in the lumen of the colon, which can lead to obstruction of the colon. The patient's symptoms are consistent with a prolonged ileus secondary to retained intraluminal old blood.

Explanation: The patient's history and examination are consistent with posterior uveitis. Intravitreal injection with vancomycin and ceftazidime is not indicated in this case, as it is not a bacterial infection. Obtaining a urinalysis is important to rule out a urinary tract infection, which can be a cause of posterior uveitis. However, the patient's history and examination do not suggest a urinary tract infection, so this is not the next step in management. Diagnostic pars plana vitrectomy is a surgical procedure that is used to treat posterior uveitis, but it is not the first-line treatment. Topical glucocorticoid therapy is the first-line treatment for posterior uveitis, and it is likely to be effective in this case.

The patient in this case has a slightly displaced pupil in one eye, along with other symptoms that are consistent with primary angle-closure glaucoma. Primary angle-closure glaucoma is a type of glaucoma that is caused by a blockage of the drainage angle in the eye, which can lead to a build-up of pressure in the eye and damage to the optic nerve. Human herpesvirus 1 (HHV-1) is a virus that can cause a number of eye problems, including uveitis, keratitis, and retinitis. Uveitis is an inflammation of the uvea, which is the middle layer of the eye. Keratitis is an inflammation of the cornea, which is the clear front part of the eye. Retinitis is an inflammation of the retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye.

Testing the aqueous fluid for HHV-1 can help to determine if the patient has an active HHV-1 infection, which could be contributing to the development of primary angle-closure glaucoma. If the patient does have an active HHV-1 infection, treatment with antiviral medications may be necessary to help to clear the infection and prevent further damage to the eye.

The other options are not as appropriate in this case. Option A, starting pilocarpine eyedrops, is a treatment for open-angle glaucoma, which is a different type of glaucoma that is not caused by a blockage of the drainage angle. Option C, obtaining specular microscopy, is a test that can be used to assess the health of the corneal endothelium, which is a layer of cells that lines the inside of the cornea. Option D, recommending genetic testing, is not appropriate in this case because there is no known genetic link to primary angle-closure glaucoma.

 69%|██████▊   | 1048/1525 [3:59:50<1:59:46, 15.07s/it]The answer is **B: Start systemic corticosteroids**.

The patient's presentation is consistent with orbital pseudotumor, also known as idiopathic orbital inflammation. This is a non-specific inflammatory condition that can affect any of the tissues of the orbit, including the extraocular muscles, fat, and optic nerve. The most common presenting symptoms are proptosis, pain, redness, and diplopia.

The diagnosis of orbital pseudotumor is typically made based on the patient's history and physical examination, with imaging studies (such as CT or MRI) used to rule out other possible causes. There is no single, definitive treatment for orbital pseudotumor, but systemic corticosteroids are often used as first-line therapy. Corticosteroids help to reduce inflammation and swelling, which can improve the patient's symptoms.

In some cases, other medications, such as immunosuppressive drugs, may also be used. In rare cases, surgery may be necessary to remove inflamed tissue or relieve pressure on the optic nerve.

The prognosis for orbital pseudotumor is generally good. With treatment, most patients experience significant improvement in their symptoms. However, the condition can be recurrent, and some patients may experience long-term problems with vision or eye movement.

The other options are incorrect because they are not the first-line treatment for orbital pseudotumor. Orbital biopsy is not typically necessary unless there is a suspicion of malignancy. Systemic antibiotics are not indicated in the absence of infection. Catheter cerebral angiography is not necessary in the absence of a suspected vascular abnormality.

The patient has a white cataract in his left eye that has progressed to the point where it is causing significant visual impairment. The cataract is also causing inflammation and edema of the cornea, which is further reducing vision. The patient has already been treated with topical antibiotics, but this has not improved his vision.

The next step in management is to remove the cataract. This can be done with a procedure called phacoemulsification, which uses ultrasonic waves to break up the cataract and then suction it out of the eye. A new lens is then placed in the eye to replace the old one.

Phacoemulsification is a safe and effective procedure that has been performed millions of times worldwide. It is usually done on an outpatient basis, and patients can usually go home the same day. The recovery time is usually short, and most patients see a significant improvement in their vision within a few weeks.

In this case, phacoemulsification with intraocular lens placement is the best option for the patient. It will remove the cataract and restore his vision. The other options are not appropriate in this case. Observation would not help the patient's vision, and it could allow the cataract to progress further. Computed tomography scan of the orbits without contrast and magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits without contrast are not indicated in this case. They would not provide any information that would change the management of the patient's cataract.

Explanation:

Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a transient cardiomyopathy that presents with chest pain, shortness of breath, and electrocardiographic changes similar to those of acute myocardial infarction. It is caused by a catecholamine surge, which can be triggered by emotional stress, physical stress, or medical procedures.

The patient in the case presented with sudden biventricular failure after lung transplantation. She had no history of coronary artery disease or other cardiac conditions. Her chest X-ray showed cardiomegaly, and her electrocardiogram showed nonspecific ST changes and T-wave inversion. These findings are consistent with Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

Pulmonary embolism with cardiogenic shock is a possible diagnosis, but it is less likely in this case because the patient had no history of thromboembolism and her chest X-ray did not show evidence of pulmonary embolism.

Myocardial infarction is also a possible diagnosis, but it is less likely in this case because the patient had no history of coronary artery disease and her electrocardiogram did not show evidence of acute myocardial infarction.

Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema is a possible diagnosis, but it is less likely in this case because the patient had no evidence of left ventricular dysfunction on her electrocardiogram.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is Takotsubo cardiomyopathy.

SFT is a rare, benign tumor that can occur in any part of the body, but is most commonly found in the abdomen, chest, and retroperitoneum. It is typically slow-growing and asymptomatic, but can sometimes cause pain, swelling, or other symptoms. SFT is composed of spindle-shaped cells that are arranged in a storiform pattern. Immunohistochemical staining typically shows diffuse positivity for CD34 and bcl-2, and negativity for CD99 and S-100. FISH studies can be used to detect the presence of a translocation t(17;22)(q21;q13), which is characteristic of SFT.

In the case presented, the patient is a man in his 30s who presented with a steady 5-year progression of facial asymmetry and new-onset left-sided facial weakness, pain, and otalgia. Physical examination revealed no palpable parotid mass and no overlying skin changes. Neurologic examination showed incomplete left eye closure with a grade 5 of 6 on the House-Brackmann scale. Treatment with steroids and antiviral agents marginally improved facial strength and allowed eye closure. Magnetic resonance imaging showed subcutaneous nodules focally infiltrating the superficial parotid gland with evidence of perineural spread along the labyrinthine segment of CN VII. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) with ultrasonographic guidance was nondiagnostic. An open excisional biopsy demonstrated dense subcutaneous tissue overlying and invading the parotid gland. Intraoperative frozen section revealed a spindle cell tumor. A superficial parotidectomy with facial nerve dissection and preservation was performed. Histopathologic examination revealed a subcutaneous mass with stellate extension into and around the parotid gland. The tumor consisted of bland fusiform tumor cells in a storiform pattern near inconspicuous hyalinized vessels. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrated diffuse positivity for CD34, positivity for bcl-2, and negativity for CD99 and S-100. FISH studies further characterized the tumor with a translocation t(17;22)(q21;q13) and corresponding COL1A1/PDGFB fusion protein.

The clinical presentation, imaging findings, histopathologic features, and immunohistochemical and FISH studies are all consistent with a diagnosis of SFT. The other options are incorrect because they do not fit the clinical presentation and findings in this case.

Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a rare, locally aggressive cutaneous sarcoma that typically presents as a solitary, raised, firm nodule on the skin. It is typically found in adults, and is more common in women than men. DFSP is composed of spindle-shaped cells that are arranged in a storiform pattern. Immunohistochemical staining typically shows positivity for CD34, bcl-2, and CD99. FISH studies can be used to detect the presence of a translocation t(17;22)(q21;q13), which is characteristic of DFSP. However, DFSP typically does not involve the parotid gland, and the patient in this case did not have any skin lesions.

Malignant melanoma is a highly malignant neoplasm of melanocytes that can occur anywhere in the body, but is most commonly found on the skin. It is typically diagnosed in adults, and is more common in men than women. Malignant melanoma can present with a variety of clinical features, including a pigmented lesion that changes in size, shape, or color. It is composed of atypical melanocytes that are arranged in a variety of patterns. Immunohistochemical staining typically shows positivity for S-100, Melan-A, and HMB-45. FISH studies can be used to detect the presence of a variety of genetic mutations that are associated with malignant melanoma. However, malignant melanoma typically does not involve the parotid gland, and the patient in this case did not have any skin lesions.

Spindle cell carcinoma is a rare, aggressive neoplasm of spindle-shaped cells that can occur in any part of the body, but is most commonly found in the skin, soft tissues, and bone. It is typically diagnosed in adults, and is more common in men than women. Spindle cell carcinoma can present with a variety of clinical features, including a painless mass that grows rapidly. It is composed of atypical spindle-shaped cells that are arranged in a variety of patterns. Immunohistochemical staining typically shows positivity for vimentin, CD34, and bcl-2. FISH studies can be used to detect the presence of a variety of genetic mutations that are associated with spindle cell carcinoma. However, spindle cell carcinoma typically does not involve the parotid gland, and the patient in this case did not have any skin lesions.

In conclusion, the correct answer is: Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT).

Explanation:

The patient in this case has bilateral conductive hearing loss (CHL) and delayed speech development. He has a normal otoscopic examination and a normal tympanogram. He has a history of tympanostomy tubes, but his hearing did not improve. He has no visual changes or other symptoms that would suggest a genetic cause for his hearing loss. A CT scan of the temporal bones shows otosclerosis, which is a condition that causes the stapes footplate to become fixed in the oval window. This prevents the stapes from moving, which reduces the transmission of sound waves to the inner ear. Otosclerosis is the most common cause of conductive hearing loss in adults.

Bilateral malleus fixation is a condition that causes the malleus, one of the three small bones in the middle ear, to become fixed in the tympanic membrane. This prevents the malleus from moving, which reduces the transmission of sound waves to the inner ear. Bilateral malleus fixation is a rare condition that is usually caused by trauma or infection.

Bilateral tympanosclerosis is a condition that causes the tympanic membrane to become thickened and scarred. This can reduce the transmission of sound waves to the inner ear. Tympanosclerosis is usually caused by repeated infections of the middle ear.

Bilateral malleoincudal subluxation is a condition that causes the malleus and incus, two of the three small bones in the middle ear, to become dislocated. This prevents the bones from moving, which reduces the transmission of sound waves to the inner ear. Bilateral malleoincudal subluxation is a rare condition that is usually caused by trauma.

In this case, the patient has a history of tympanostomy tubes, which suggests that he may have had repeated infections of the middle ear. This would make otosclerosis a more likely diagnosis than the other three conditions. Additionally, the patient's CT scan of the temporal bones shows otosclerosis, which is further evidence that this is the correct diagnosis.

A hemangioma is a benign (noncancerous) tumor made up of blood vessels. It is the most common type of vascular tumor in children. Hemangiomas can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common on the head and neck.

The symptoms of a hemangioma vary depending on its size and location. Small hemangiomas may not cause any symptoms. Larger hemangiomas can cause swelling, pain, and difficulty breathing.

The diagnosis of a hemangioma is usually made based on a physical examination. Imaging tests, such as an ultrasound or MRI, may be used to confirm the diagnosis and determine the size and location of the hemangioma.

The treatment of a hemangioma depends on its size, location, and symptoms. Small hemangiomas that are not causing any problems may not need to be treated. Larger hemangiomas or those that are causing problems may be treated with surgery, laser therapy, or medication.

In the case of the patient in the question, the symptoms of intermittent dysphagia to solid foods, dry cough, foreign-body sensation in the throat, and dyspnea on effort for 4 months are consistent with a supraglottic hemangioma. The reddish, 2-cm supraglottic lesion involving medially the free margin of the suprahyoid epiglottis seen on fiber-optic laryngoscopy is also consistent with a hemangioma. The MRI scan revealing an oval, 2.2-cm hypervascular mass arising from the free border of the suprahyoid epiglottis, which extended along the right aryepiglottic fold, further supports the diagnosis of a hemangioma. The fact that the mass appeared to be capsulated, with regular margins, and did not show laryngeal deep tissues invasion suggests that the hemangioma is benign.

The other possible diagnoses, supraglottic paraganglioma, rhabdomyoma of the epiglottis, and laryngeal squamous papilloma, are all less likely in this case. Supraglottic paragangliomas are rare, malignant tumors that typically occur in adults. Rhabdomyomas of the epiglottis are also rare, benign tumors that typically occur in children. Laryngeal squamous papillomas are common, benign tumors that typically occur in adults.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for the patient in the question is a supraglottic hemangioma.

Explanation:

The patient is a young man with a history of joint, back, and abdominal pain; constipation; fatigue; and depression. He has an elevated serum ionized calcium level and a normal intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) level. A technetium Tc-99m sestamibi scan showed no definitive lesion but demonstrated a small focus of possible increased tracer uptake near the mid-pole of the left thyroid lobe. No abnormal masses were readily identifiable by ultrasonography or contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the neck. He underwent a parathyroid exploration and excision of a soft, ovoid tissue, believed to be a slightly enlarged left inferior parathyroid gland. Intracytoplasmic fat vacuoles were evident on intraoperative touch preparation. Histological examination of permanent sections showed a thinly encapsulated parathyroid tissue with approximately 30% displaying myxoid stromal change and focal presence of interspersed adipocytes.

These findings are most consistent with the diagnosis of parathyroid lipohyperplasia. Parathyroid lipohyperplasia is a rare condition characterized by the presence of excessive fat in the parathyroid glands. It is most commonly seen in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, but it can also occur in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism. The clinical presentation of parathyroid lipohyperplasia is variable. Some patients may be asymptomatic, while others may present with symptoms of hypercalcemia, such as fatigue, weakness, constipation, and polyuria. The diagnosis of parathyroid lipohyperplasia is made based on the findings of imaging studies and histological examination of parathyroid tissue. Treatment is typically not required for asymptomatic patients. However, patients with symptomatic hypercalcemia may require parathyroidectomy.

The other options are incorrect because they do not adequately explain the patient's presentation.

* Option A, Hyperplastic parathyroid, is incorrect because it does not account for the presence of intracytoplasmic fat vacuoles on intraoperative touch preparation.
* Option C, Parathyroid lipoadenoma, is incorrect because it is a rare tumor that is not typically associated with hypercalcemia.
* Option D, Parathyroid carcinoma, is incorrect because it is a malignant tumor that is not typically associated with hypercalcemia in young patients.

Explanation:

The patient is a man in his 30s with no medical history who presented with a 2-year history of waxing and waning pruritic papules involving his left popliteus, contralateral popliteus, groin, and penis. The lesions were initially treated with empirical antibiotics for a presumptive clinical diagnosis of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection, but there was minimal response. The patient subsequently sought an alternate clinical consultation given the appearance of new violaceous ulcerated lesions over his right lateral proximal calf.

Physical examination was unremarkable for hepatosplenomegaly or systemic adenopathy. Laboratory evaluation including complete blood cell count, peripheral blood cultures, MRSA swab, human immunodeficiency virus/human T-cell lymphotropic virus testing, flow cytometry, and Lyme disease titers had unremarkable results.

Pathologic sampling of the lesions revealed V-shaped perifascicular infiltrative large lymphocytes with abundant amphophilic cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli. Lesional cells exclusively involving the dermis stained positive for CD30, leukocyte common antigen, CD2, TIA-1, and CD4 and negative for CD7, CD8, CD43, CD56, and programmed cell death protein 1. Scattered B lymphocytes were PAX5 positive and CD20 positive. Ki-67 level was 87%. Scattered dermal dendritic and Langerhans cells were S100 positive. T-cell receptor (TCR) gene rearrangement testing had negative results. Systemic imaging did not reveal extracutaneous involvement, and screening endoscopy for upper and lower gastrointestinal involvement had unremarkable results.

The patient's clinical presentation and pathologic findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of primary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (PCaLCL). PCaLCL is a rare, aggressive lymphoma that typically presents with single or multiple skin lesions. The lesions are often violaceous or erythematous papules or nodules that may ulcerate. PCaLCL is a CD30-positive T-cell lymphoma that typically expresses CD4 and CD2. The Ki-67 proliferation index is typically high, and TCR gene rearrangement testing is usually negative. PCaLCL can be localized or disseminated, and the disease may progress to systemic lymphoma. Treatment for PCaLCL typically involves combination chemotherapy, with or without radiation therapy.

The other possible diagnoses in this case are Adult T-cell leukemia-lymphoma (ATLL), Lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP), and Transformed mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome. ATLL is a rare, aggressive T-cell lymphoma that typically presents with fever, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy. LyP is a chronic, non-aggressive lymphoma that typically presents with recurrent crops of papules or nodules. Transformed mycosis fungoides and Sézary syndrome is a rare, aggressive T-cell lymphoma that typically presents with a generalized skin rash.

In conclusion, the patient's clinical presentation and pathologic findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of PCaLCL.

 69%|██████▉   | 1056/1525 [4:01:53<2:05:41, 16.08s/it]The correct answer is: D. The patient has subclinical hypothyroidism and should have the TSH level repeated in 1 to 3 months.

Explanation:

The patient's TSH level is 10.0 uIU/mL, which is above the reference range of 0.4 to 4.5 uIU/mL. This indicates that the patient's thyroid gland is not producing enough thyroid hormone. This is called subclinical hypothyroidism.

Subclinical hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone, but the symptoms are not severe enough to be diagnosed as overt hypothyroidism. The symptoms of subclinical hypothyroidism can include fatigue, weight gain, dry skin, hair loss, and constipation.

The treatment for subclinical hypothyroidism is usually to take thyroid hormone replacement medication. However, in some cases, the condition may resolve on its own. If the patient is not experiencing any symptoms, the doctor may recommend that the TSH level be repeated in 1 to 3 months to see if the level has decreased.

The other options are incorrect because:

* Option A: The patient does not have overt hypothyroidism. Overt hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone, and the symptoms are severe enough to cause a noticeable change in the patient's health.
* Option B: The patient does not have subclinical hyperthyroidism. Subclinical hyperthyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone, but the symptoms are not severe enough to be diagnosed as overt hyperthyroidism.
* Option C: The patient does not need a repeat testing of a TSH level. The patient's TSH level is above the reference range, so it is important to repeat the test in 1 to 3 months to see if the level has decreased.

Explanation:

The patient's presentation is consistent with Wernicke encephalopathy, a thiamine deficiency syndrome that can occur in the setting of malnutrition, alcoholism, or surgery. The classic triad of Wernicke encephalopathy includes nystagmus, ataxia, and confusion. The patient in this case has nystagmus, hyperalgesia and allodynia in the lower extremities, and diminished ankle reflexes, all of which are consistent with Wernicke encephalopathy.

The treatment for Wernicke encephalopathy is thiamine replacement. Intravenous thiamine is the preferred route of administration, as it is more effective than oral thiamine. Parenteral thiamine is also recommended in patients with severe Wernicke encephalopathy, as they may not be able to absorb oral thiamine.

Acyclovir is an antiviral medication that is used to treat herpes simplex virus infections. It is not indicated for the treatment of Wernicke encephalopathy.

Thrombolysis is a procedure that is used to dissolve blood clots. It is not indicated for the treatment of Wernicke encephalopathy.

Explanation:

Vitiligo is a common skin condition that causes the loss of skin pigment. It can affect any part of the body, but it is most common on the face, hands, arms, and legs. The cause of vitiligo is not fully understood, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder. This means that the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the cells that produce melanin, the pigment that gives skin its color.

Vitiligo is not contagious and is not life-threatening. However, it can be cosmetically disfiguring and can cause emotional distress. There is no cure for vitiligo, but there are treatments that can help to improve its appearance.

The lesions in the case presented are consistent with vitiligo. They are round, hypopigmented macules that are symmetrically distributed in the affected area. The patient has no history of tinea versicolor, which is a fungal infection that can also cause hypopigmented lesions. The skin biopsy showed a lack of melanocytes, which are the cells that produce melanin. This is consistent with the diagnosis of vitiligo.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Guttata hypomelanosis is a common skin condition that causes small, white spots on the skin. It is usually caused by a viral infection or a reaction to a medication. The lesions in the case presented are not consistent with guttata hypomelanosis.
* Tumors of the follicular infundibulum are rare tumors that can occur in the hair follicles. They are usually benign, but they can sometimes be malignant. The lesions in the case presented are not consistent with tumors of the follicular infundibulum.
* Tuberculoid leprosy is a chronic infectious disease that is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium leprae. It can cause a variety of skin lesions, including hypopigmented macules. However, the patient in the case presented has no history of exposure to leprosy. The skin biopsy showed no evidence of Mycobacterium leprae.

Explanation:

The patient in the case presentation has a number of features that are consistent with antimelanoma differentiation associated gene 5 clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis (ADM). These features include:

* Muscle weakness, which is typically proximal and symmetric.
* Skin changes, such as heliotrope rash (a purplish discoloration of the eyelids), Gottron's papules (raised, red lesions on the knuckles), and periungual telangiectasias (red streaks on the nails).
* Raynaud's phenomenon, which is a condition that causes the fingers and toes to become pale, numb, and painful when exposed to cold.
* Interstitial lung disease, which is a condition that causes inflammation and scarring in the lungs.

The patient in the case presentation also has a number of laboratory findings that are consistent with ADM, including:

* Anti-MDA5 antibodies, which are antibodies that attack the body's own tissues.
* Elevated levels of muscle enzymes, such as creatine kinase and aldolase.
* Decreased levels of T lymphocytes, which are a type of white blood cell.

The patient in the case presentation does not have any features that are consistent with sarcoidosis or lymphoma. Sarcoidosis is a condition that causes inflammation of the lymph nodes, lungs, and other organs. Lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymph nodes.

The patient in the case presentation also does not have any features that are consistent with immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD). IgG4-RD is a condition that causes inflammation of the organs, including the kidneys, pancreas, and liver.

The patient in the case presentation does not have any features that are consistent with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). SLE is an autoimmune disease that can affect many different parts of the body, including the skin, joints, kidneys, and heart.

In conclusion, the patient in the case presentation most likely has antimelanoma differentiation associated gene 5 clinically amyopathic dermatomyositis.

Wells syndrome is a rare, chronic, relapsing, and remitting disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of painful, pruritic, erythematous papules and plaques on the extremities. Cutaneous amyloidosis is a rare, acquired, systemic disorder characterized by the deposition of amyloid in the skin. Crystal-storing histiocytosis is a rare, non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis characterized by the accumulation of lipid-laden histiocytes in the skin, lymph nodes, and other organs. Erysipelas is a superficial skin infection caused by group A streptococcus.

The patient in the case presented with a 2-month history of painful, occasionally pruritic, fixed erythema on the abdomen. He also suffered from a splenic marginal zone lymphoma with bone marrow infiltration, had a history of splenectomy, and an IgM-κ paraproteinemia. His hematologic condition was considered stable by his physician, who had also been treating the patient for hepatitis C with ledipasvir-sofosbuvir for 3 months. On examination, there was a warm erythema on most of the abdomen, which appeared distended owing to hepatitis-induced ascites. Laboratory results showed an elevated but stable white blood cell count of 19.04 × 103µL, a recent rise of C-reactive protein levels to 179 mg/L, as well as a rise of IgM levels from 1060 mg/dL to 2220 mg/dL within the past year. A biopsy procedure was performed on the abdomen, which showed an interstitial infiltrate of deeply eosinophilic cells in the entire dermis and adjacent subcutis.

The clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and biopsy results are consistent with a diagnosis of crystal-storing histiocytosis. Crystal-storing histiocytosis is a rare, non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis characterized by the accumulation of lipid-laden histiocytes in the skin, lymph nodes, and other organs. The disease is often associated with hematologic disorders, such as lymphoma and leukemia. The treatment of crystal-storing histiocytosis is not well-established, but corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents have been used with some success.

The other answer choices are incorrect. Wells syndrome is a rare, chronic, relapsing, and remitting disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of painful, pruritic, erythematous papules and plaques on the extremities. Cutaneous amyloidosis is a rare, acquired, systemic disorder characterized by the deposition of amyloid in the skin. Erysipelas is a superficial skin infection caused by group A streptococcus.

 70%|██████▉   | 1061/1525 [4:02:54<1:46:43, 13.80s/it]The answer is B: Urea cycle disorder.

A urea cycle disorder is a group of inherited genetic disorders that affect the body's ability to break down ammonia. Ammonia is a waste product produced by the body when it breaks down proteins. Normally, ammonia is converted into urea, which is then excreted in the urine. However, in people with a urea cycle disorder, ammonia builds up in the blood, leading to a variety of symptoms, including vomiting, lethargy, confusion, and seizures. In severe cases, urea cycle disorders can lead to coma and death.

The patient in this case presented with a 5-day history of vomiting, followed by lethargy and confusion. He also had a history of hospitalization with coma two years prior. An extensive workup done at that time only revealed an elevated ammonia level of 233 µg/dL. Etiology remained unclear but he improved with lactulose.

The patient's current presentation is consistent with a urea cycle disorder. His elevated ammonia level, respiratory alkalosis, and normal liver and kidney function are all suggestive of this diagnosis. Additionally, his history of recurrent coma and refractory status epilepticus are also consistent with a urea cycle disorder.

Reye syndrome is a rare, potentially life-threatening condition that can affect children and teenagers. It is characterized by a combination of liver failure, encephalopathy, and fatty degeneration of the viscera. The exact cause of Reye syndrome is unknown, but it is thought to be triggered by a viral infection, such as chickenpox or influenza, in combination with the use of certain medications, such as aspirin.

Fatty acid oxidation disorders are a group of inherited genetic disorders that affect the body's ability to break down fatty acids. Fatty acids are a type of fat that the body uses for energy. When fatty acids cannot be broken down properly, they build up in the blood and tissues, leading to a variety of symptoms, including vomiting, lethargy, seizures, and coma. In severe cases, fatty acid oxidation disorders can lead to death.

Organic acidemias are a group of inherited genetic disorders that affect the body's ability to break down certain organic acids. Organic acids are a type of molecule that the body produces as a byproduct of metabolism. When organic acids cannot be broken down properly, they build up in the blood and tissues, leading to a variety of symptoms, including vomiting, lethargy, seizures, and coma. In severe cases, organic acidemias can lead to death.

In conclusion, the patient in this case most likely has a urea cycle disorder. His presentation is consistent with this diagnosis, and there are no other diagnoses that fit the clinical picture as well.

The patient is a 7-year-old girl with a history of fever, sore throat, bilateral conjunctival hemorrhage, periorbital edema, and eyelid ecchymoses. She had tonsillar hypertrophy with erythema and exudates. Her liver and spleen were mildly enlarged. Laboratory tests showed leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 16.7 000/μL with a predominance of lymphocytes, mild thrombocytopenia (platelet count, 108 × 103/μL), elevated aminotransferases (alanine aminotransferase, 232 U/L; aspartate aminotransferase, 261 U/L), γ-glutamyltransferase (265 U/L), conjugated bilirubin (2.3 mg/dL), and lactate dehydrogenase (2116 U/L). A throat culture grew group A Streptococcus.

The most likely diagnosis is streptococcal pharyngitis. This is supported by the patient's history and physical examination, as well as the laboratory findings. The patient's fever, sore throat, and periorbital edema are all consistent with streptococcal pharyngitis. The presence of tonsillar hypertrophy with erythema and exudates is also consistent with this diagnosis. The patient's mildly elevated liver enzymes and lactate dehydrogenase are non-specific findings that can be seen with a variety of infections, including streptococcal pharyngitis. The most important finding in this case is the positive throat culture for group A Streptococcus. This confirms the diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely. Epstein-Barr virus infection is a viral infection that can cause pharyngitis, but it is not typically associated with periorbital edema or eyelid ecchymoses. Neuroblastoma is a rare cancer that can occur in children. It is not typically associated with pharyngitis or periorbital edema. Viral hepatitis is a viral infection that can cause liver inflammation. It is not typically associated with pharyngitis or periorbital edema.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is streptococcal pharyngitis. This is supported by the patient's history and physical examination, as well as the laboratory findings.

Explanation:

The patient's history of a motorcycle crash many years ago, as well as the presence of a large air-fluid level on chest roentgenogram and subsequent computed tomographic scans of his chest, are consistent with a diagnosis of blunt traumatic rupture of the diaphragm.

A type IV hiatal hernia is a herniation of the stomach through the diaphragm into the chest cavity. However, this type of hernia is usually not associated with trauma.

A congenital diaphragmatic hernia is a defect in the diaphragm that is present at birth. This type of hernia is also not usually associated with trauma.

A diaphragm eventration is a condition in which a portion of the diaphragm becomes thin and atrophic, resulting in a protrusion of the abdominal contents into the chest cavity. This condition is usually not associated with trauma.

In the case of the patient in the question, the most likely diagnosis is blunt traumatic rupture of the diaphragm. This diagnosis is supported by the patient's history of a motorcycle crash many years ago, as well as the presence of a large air-fluid level on chest roentgenogram and subsequent computed tomographic scans of his chest.

Explanation:

The patient has a history of myocardial infarction and coronary intervention with a drug-eluting stent. He is now presenting with progressive shortness of breath. Physical examination reveals tachycardia, tachypnea, and bilateral rales. Chest auscultation reveals faint S1 and S2. Laboratory findings are within normal limits. Twelve-lead electrocardiography demonstrates persistent ST-T segment elevation in V2 to V6 leads. Transthoracic echocardiography shows a hypoechoic mass around the apical region. Computed tomography of the chest reveals a large crescentic hypodense lesion surrounding the anterolateral wall of the left ventricle and apex.

The most likely diagnosis is intramural hematoma. This is a collection of blood within the wall of the heart. It is most commonly caused by myocardial infarction, but it can also be caused by trauma, aortic dissection, or other conditions. The symptoms of intramural hematoma can vary depending on the size of the hematoma and the location of the hematoma. In some cases, there may be no symptoms. In other cases, the patient may experience chest pain, shortness of breath, or other symptoms of heart failure.

The diagnosis of intramural hematoma is made with echocardiography or computed tomography. Treatment is generally supportive. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the hematoma or to repair the damage to the heart wall.

The other possible diagnoses are not as likely in this case. Pseudoaneurysm due to free wall rupture is a rare complication of myocardial infarction. It is characterized by a collection of blood that forms between the layers of the heart wall. This can lead to sudden death if the aneurysm ruptures. Postinfarction hemorrhagic pericarditis is a condition in which blood accumulates in the sac around the heart. This can cause chest pain, shortness of breath, and other symptoms. Intramural hematoma is more likely than these other conditions in this case because the patient has a history of myocardial infarction and coronary intervention.

The patient is a healthy teenaged boy who presented with multiple target lesions and erythema on his right eyelids. The lesions are consistent with a diagnosis of herpes zoster ophthalmicus, which is a viral infection of the facial nerve. The most common treatment for herpes zoster is oral aciclovir, but this should only be given to patients who are at high risk of complications, such as those with a weakened immune system. In this case, the patient is a healthy young man with no known medical conditions, so he is not at high risk of complications. Therefore, the best course of action is to observe the patient and monitor the lesions for signs of improvement. If the lesions do not improve or if they become worse, then oral aciclovir can be started.

The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: Prescribe oral flucloxacillin.** Flucloxacillin is an antibiotic that is used to treat bacterial infections. Herpes zoster is a viral infection, so antibiotics are not effective in treating it.
* **C: Prescribe oral aciclovir.** Aciclovir is an antiviral medication that is used to treat herpes zoster. However, as mentioned above, it is only necessary to give aciclovir to patients who are at high risk of complications. This patient is not at high risk of complications, so aciclovir is not necessary in this case.

An electroretinogram (ERG) is a test that measures the electrical activity of the retina. It is used to diagnose and monitor a variety of eye conditions, including retinal diseases, glaucoma, and optic nerve disorders.

In this case, the patient has a history of Klinefelter syndrome, which is a genetic condition that can cause a variety of eye problems, including photophobia. An ERG can help to determine if the patient's photophobia is caused by a retinal problem.

The other answers are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate next steps in the management of this patient.

* Option B: Perform corneal cultures is not the most appropriate next step because the patient does not have any signs or symptoms of a corneal infection. Corneal cultures are only necessary if there is suspicion of an infection.
* Option C: Start topical steroids and cyclosporine A eyedrops is not the most appropriate next step because the patient does not have any signs or symptoms of inflammation. Topical steroids and cyclosporine A eyedrops are only used to treat inflammation.
* Option D: Observe is not the most appropriate next step because the patient has a history of Klinefelter syndrome, which is a genetic condition that can cause a variety of eye problems. It is important to rule out any underlying eye problems that could be causing the patient's photophobia.

The patient is presenting with signs and symptoms of a cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), which is a serious condition that can lead to stroke, coma, and death. The most common treatment for CVST is anticoagulation with heparin or warfarin. However, in patients with evidence of intracranial hypertension, such as papilledema or decreased consciousness, an immediate lumbar puncture (LP) should be performed to measure the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure and to rule out meningitis. If the CSF pressure is elevated, it should be lowered with mannitol or furosemide. In addition, antibiotics should be started to treat any underlying infection.

The patient in this case has a history of CVST, and she is now presenting with worsening headache, nausea, blurred vision, fevers, weakness, and spasticity. She also has right ear pain and decreased hearing, which suggests that she may have mastoiditis. On physical examination, she has otitis media on the right side. Ophthalmic examination shows edema of the optic nerves bilaterally. These findings are consistent with a CVST that has progressed to the point of causing intracranial hypertension.

The most important next step in the management of this patient is to perform an immediate LP to measure the CSF pressure and to rule out meningitis. If the CSF pressure is elevated, it should be lowered with mannitol or furosemide. In addition, antibiotics should be started to treat any underlying infection. Anticoagulation with heparin or warfarin should also be continued.

The other options are incorrect because they do not address the immediate need to measure the CSF pressure and to treat any underlying infection. Option A, continuing anticoagulation and monitoring closely in an outpatient clinical setting, is incorrect because the patient is at risk for developing serious complications, such as stroke, coma, and death. Option B, continuing anticoagulation, prescribing oral antibiotics, and monitoring closely in an outpatient clinical setting, is also incorrect because the patient needs to be hospitalized and treated with intravenous antibiotics. Option D, performing an urgent radical mastoidectomy, is incorrect because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with mastoiditis.

The patient's presentation is concerning for a mass lesion in the posterior fossa, which could be compressing the brainstem and causing his symptoms. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) are the most sensitive and specific imaging modalities for evaluating the brain and cervical spine. They can help to identify a mass lesion, as well as its location, size, and vascularity. This information is essential for planning further management, such as surgery or radiation therapy.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* A. Perform a lumbar puncture and measure opening pressure and cerebrospinal fluid composition. A lumbar puncture is not indicated in this patient because he does not have any signs or symptoms of meningitis or meningismus. In addition, lumbar puncture carries a risk of complications, such as headache, infection, and bleeding.
* C. Perform an apraclonidine test to confirm diagnosis of Horner syndrome. An apraclonidine test is a diagnostic test for Horner syndrome. It involves instilling a drop of apraclonidine, a medication that causes the pupils to dilate, into the eye. If the affected pupil does not dilate, it confirms the diagnosis of Horner syndrome. However, in this patient, the diagnosis of Horner syndrome is already established based on his clinical presentation and the results of the cocaine test.
* D. Order tests for erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, and syphilis serologies. These tests are not indicated in this patient because they are not specific for the underlying cause of his symptoms. In addition, these tests carry a risk of false-positive results.

The patient in the case has diffuse epicardial involvement on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, which is a characteristic finding of giant cell myocarditis. Giant cell myocarditis is a rare, but potentially fatal, inflammatory disease of the heart muscle. It is most commonly seen in middle-aged women, and it is often associated with other autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus.

The diagnosis of giant cell myocarditis is made based on a combination of clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The most specific test for giant cell myocarditis is cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, which can show diffuse epicardial involvement. Other tests that may be helpful in the diagnosis include blood tests for elevated levels of inflammatory markers, such as troponin and creatine kinase, and electrocardiography, which may show ST-segment elevation.

There is no specific treatment for giant cell myocarditis, but treatment with steroids and other immunosuppressive medications can be effective in controlling the inflammation and preventing further damage to the heart muscle. In some cases, heart transplantation may be necessary.

The patient in the case has a number of features that are consistent with giant cell myocarditis, including progressive shortness of breath, ST-segment elevation on the electrocardiogram, elevated troponin levels, and diffuse epicardial involvement on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging. Based on these findings, it is reasonable to recommend positron emission tomographic/CT imaging to guide steroid treatment. Positron emission tomographic/CT imaging is a specialized imaging test that can be used to detect inflammation in the heart muscle. This information can be helpful in guiding the treatment of giant cell myocarditis, which typically involves the use of steroids and other immunosuppressive medications.

The other options are not as appropriate in this case. Option A (conduct close follow-up and provide medical treatment) is not specific enough. It is important to determine the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, and giant cell myocarditis is a serious condition that requires treatment. Option C (initiate steroid pulse therapy) is also not as appropriate as positron emission tomographic/CT imaging. Steroid pulse therapy is a treatment option for giant cell myocarditis, but it is important to first determine the extent of the inflammation and the location of the inflammation in the heart muscle. Positron emission tomographic/CT imaging can provide this information. Option D (perform serum and urine immunofixation and light chain determination) is not relevant in this case. This test is used to detect certain types of cancer, but it is not necessary for the diagnosis of giant cell myocarditis.

Explanation:

The patient is a woman in her 30s who presented with a 3-month history of painful swelling of the left hard palate and cheek. The growth also caused malocclusion and ipsilateral upper lip numbness. She reported no recent trauma; no difficulty speaking, breathing, or swallowing; no epistaxis, nasal congestion or nasal drainage; and no recent fevers. She did have a history of recent pericoronitis, but several courses of antibiotics were unhelpful. Physical examination revealed a submucosal growth centered on the mesial aspect of the left maxillary alveolus. Transnasal endoscopy was unremarkable. Contrasted computed tomographic and magnetic resonance imaging showed a heterogeneously ossified lesion filling the left maxillary sinus, with local destruction of hard palate and alveolar bone. Positron emission tomographic scans highlighted the fluorodeoxyglucose-avid nature of both the tumor and associated cervical lymphadenopathy. A biopsy showed a tumor with lobular architecture, an incomplete peripheral ossified rim, and focal areas of osteoid matrix. Higher power showed atypical cells with increased mitotic activity in a myxoid stroma. Immunostains were negative for S100, pankeratin AE1/AE3, SMSA, and GFAP.

The differential diagnosis for a destructive hard palate mass includes a variety of benign and malignant tumors. Benign tumors that can occur in this location include fibroma, ossifying fibroma, myxoma, and hemangioma. Malignant tumors that can occur in this location include osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, malignant mixed tumor of salivary gland, and malignant ossifying fibromyxoid tumor.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is malignant ossifying fibromyxoid tumor. This tumor is a rare, mesenchymal neoplasm that typically occurs in the extremities of young adults. It is characterized by a lobular growth pattern, an incomplete peripheral ossified rim, and focal areas of osteoid matrix. The tumor cells are typically atypical and have increased mitotic activity. Immunostains are usually negative for S100, pankeratin AE1/AE3, SMSA, and GFAP.

The treatment for malignant ossifying fibromyxoid tumor is surgical resection. Radiation therapy may also be used. The prognosis for this tumor is poor, with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 30%.

The other options in the differential diagnosis are less likely in this case. Fibroma is a benign tumor that is composed of fibrous tissue. Ossifying fibroma is a benign tumor that is composed of fibrous tissue and bone. Myxoma is a benign tumor that is composed of myxoid tissue. Hemangioma is a benign tumor that is composed of blood vessels. Osteosarcoma is a malignant tumor that is composed of bone. Chondrosarcoma is a malignant tumor that is composed of cartilage. Malignant mixed tumor of salivary gland is a malignant tumor that is composed of epithelial and mesenchymal tissues.

Explanation:

The patient presented with a large, irregular pedunculated mass on the left anterior false vocal fold. The mass was seen to ball-valve in and out of the glottis with respiration. This suggests that the mass is obstructing the airway. The mass was removed with microscissors and pathologic examination revealed a 1.7 × 1.3 × 1.0-cm mass with a papillary-like architecture, expansion of the submucosa by benign mature adipose tissue, and variable amount of fibrous tissue. There was mild chronic submucosal inflammation without squamous epithelial proliferation. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of lipoma.

A vocal cord polyp is a benign growth that arises from the vocal cord mucosa. It is usually caused by chronic vocal abuse, such as shouting or singing. Vocal cord polyps can cause hoarseness, breathiness, and pain. They are usually treated with voice rest and/or surgery.

A squamous papilloma is a benign growth that arises from the squamous epithelium of the larynx. It is usually caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). Squamous papillomas can cause hoarseness, breathiness, and pain. They are usually treated with surgery.

Adenoid cystic carcinoma is a malignant tumor that arises from the salivary glands. It is the most common type of salivary gland carcinoma. Adenoid cystic carcinoma can spread to the lymph nodes and other parts of the body. It is usually treated with surgery, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy.

A fungus ball is a mass of fungal hyphae that can form in the sinuses. It is usually seen in patients with chronic sinusitis, and is not associated with the clinical features described in the case.

Cerebrospinal fluid leak with sinusitis is a condition in which cerebrospinal fluid leaks from the brain into the sinuses. It can cause headache, facial pain, and rhinorrhea. However, the CT scan and MRI scan in the case do not show any evidence of a cerebrospinal fluid leak.

Hypervascular metastasis from thyroid cancer is a rare condition in which cancer cells from the thyroid gland metastasize to the sphenoid sinus. It can cause headache, facial pain, and diplopia. However, the CT scan and MRI scan in the case do not show any evidence of a metastasis.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is an intrasphenoid pseudoaneurysm of the internal carotid artery. A pseudoaneurysm is a sac that forms when the wall of an artery weakens and bulges out. It can be caused by trauma, infection, or a congenital defect. Intrasphenoid pseudoaneurysms are rare, but they can be life-threatening if they rupture. The clinical features described in the case are consistent with an intrasphenoid pseudoaneurysm, and the CT scan and MRI scan show a characteristic appearance of the lesion.

Kimura disease is a rare, chronic, non-neoplastic disorder characterized by lymphadenopathy, angiofollicular hyperplasia, and eosinophilia. It is most commonly seen in young men of Asian descent. The etiology of Kimura disease is unknown, but it is thought to be a T-cell-mediated disorder.

The classic presentation of Kimura disease is a unilateral, painless, lymphadenopathy of the head and neck. The lymph nodes are usually soft, rubbery, and non-tender. The overlying skin may be erythematous and edematous. Other features of Kimura disease may include fever, arthralgias, rash, and weight loss.

The diagnosis of Kimura disease is made based on the clinical presentation and the histopathologic findings of a lymph node biopsy. The biopsy shows a characteristic pattern of angiofollicular hyperplasia, which is a proliferation of lymph follicles with a central vascular core. The lymph nodes also contain a mixed inflammatory infiltrate, including eosinophils.

There is no cure for Kimura disease, but the condition is usually self-limited and resolves within a few years. Treatment is aimed at relieving the symptoms and preventing complications. Treatment options include corticosteroids, radiation therapy, and surgery.

The other options are incorrect because they do not fit the clinical presentation and the histopathologic findings of this case.

 70%|███████   | 1074/1525 [4:05:50<1:52:42, 14.99s/it]The answer is: **B. Laryngocele**

Explanation:

A laryngocele is a cystic mass that arises from the mucosa of the larynx. It is most commonly found in the supraglottic region, but can also occur in the subglottic or glottic regions. Laryngoceles are typically benign, but can rarely become malignant.

The patient in the case presented with a 5-week history of hoarseness and foreign body sensation in his throat. His voice was breathy and raspy, and he projected his voice poorly. He denied dyspnea, dysphagia, odynophagia, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy. He had no clinically significant medical, surgical, or social history.

Flexible Lindholm laryngoscopy revealed a large, right-sided, supraglottic, submucosal mass expanding the aryepiglottic fold and false vocal fold with hypomobility of the right vocal fold. The lesion extended posterolaterally to the aryepiglottic fold and obscured visualization of the glottis. The right laryngeal ventricle was effaced, but the mucosal surface of both true vocal cords appeared normal. A computed tomographic (CT) scan to determine the extent of the lesion revealed a cystic mass with no protrusion out of the thyrohyoid space or into the subglottic airway.

Intraoperatively, the lesion was fully visualized with a Lindholm laryngoscope. The mass was completely removed using a pulsed potassium titanyl phosphate laser to make mucosal incisions just lateral to the aryepiglottic fold and cold instrumentation to manipulate and remove the mass. Strategic needle decompression and angled endoscopes facilitated complete visualization and removal of the mass. The paraglottic space was closed via endoscopic suturing. The patient tolerated oral intake and was discharged home within 24 hours. Pathologic findings were benign. Considerable voice improvement and vocal fold mobility was noted at 6 weeks, with normal vocal fold movement, normal mucosal pliability, and complete glottic closure achieved at 1 year.

The clinical presentation, imaging findings, and surgical findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of laryngocele. Laryngoceles are typically benign, and the patient in the case had a good outcome after surgical removal of the mass.

The other possible diagnoses are all less likely in this case. Laryngeal carcinoma is a malignant tumor of the larynx. It is typically associated with a history of smoking or other tobacco use. The patient in the case did not have a history of smoking, and his imaging findings were not consistent with laryngeal carcinoma.

Thyroid cartilage chondroma is a benign tumor of the thyroid cartilage. It is typically found in the anterior neck, and is not associated with hoarseness. The patient in the case had hoarseness, and his imaging findings were not consistent with thyroid cartilage chondroma.

Laryngeal saccular cyst is a benign cyst that arises from the mucosa of the larynx. It is typically found in the supraglottic region, and is not associated with hoarseness. The patient in the case had hoarseness, and his imaging findings were not consistent with laryngeal saccular cyst.

The patient is a woman in her 40s with relapsed grade 2 follicular lymphoma receiving therapy with idelalisib, 150 mg twice daily for the past 5 months. She presented with 3 days of vomiting, cramping abdominal pain, and diarrhea. She initially had 10 to 12 watery bowel movements a day, which progressed to passage of bright red blood per rectum. She reported no sick contacts, recent travel, recent antibiotic exposure, or nutritional supplement intake. She denied use of tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs.

Vital signs were notable for elevated temperature (37.9°C), tachycardia (heart rate, 112/min), respiratory rate of 16/min, and blood pressure of 105/60 mm Hg. Physical examination showed a soft nondistended abdomen without organomegaly and normal bowel sounds. She had diffuse tenderness to deep palpation.

Laboratory evaluation revealed normal hematological indices, renal function, and hepatic function. Computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated colonic wall thickening without perforation and stable prior pelvic lymphadenopathy. No pathogenic organisms or parasitic ova were detected on stool culture. Results of a stool Clostridium difficile toxin assay were negative. Flexible sigmoidoscopy demonstrated grossly congested and erythematous mucosa in the rectosigmoid and descending colon. Histopathology from the biopsies of one of the affected areas is shown in the Figure.

The most likely diagnosis is idelalisib-induced colitis. This is a known adverse effect of idelalisib, which is a kinase inhibitor used to treat lymphoma. The patient's presentation is consistent with colitis, and the findings on CT scan and flexible sigmoidoscopy are also consistent with colitis. The negative stool culture and stool Clostridium difficile toxin assay rule out infection as the cause of the colitis.

Cytomegalovirus infection is a possible diagnosis, but it is less likely than idelalisib-induced colitis. The patient does not have any risk factors for cytomegalovirus infection, and the findings on CT scan and flexible sigmoidoscopy are not typical of cytomegalovirus infection.

Lymphomatous polyposis is a possible diagnosis, but it is less likely than idelalisib-induced colitis. The patient does not have any risk factors for lymphoma, and the findings on CT scan and flexible sigmoidoscopy are not typical of lymphoma.

Ischemic colitis is a possible diagnosis, but it is less likely than idelalisib-induced colitis. The patient does not have any risk factors for ischemic colitis, and the findings on CT scan and flexible sigmoidoscopy are not typical of ischemic colitis.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis is idelalisib-induced colitis.

The patient's presentation is consistent with hand-foot-mouth disease, a viral infection that is common in children but can also occur in adults. The most common symptoms are fever, sore throat, and a vesicular rash on the hands, feet, and mouth. The rash is often described as being "painless" or "mildly painful." The diagnosis is usually made clinically, but laboratory testing can be helpful to confirm the diagnosis and to rule out other possible causes.

The most common laboratory test for hand-foot-mouth disease is polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing. PCR testing is a highly sensitive and specific test that can detect the presence of viral DNA in a sample. In this case, PCR testing of a swab from the patient's lesions would be the most appropriate next step.

The other possible answers are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate next steps in the management of this patient.

* Answer A: Check serum bullous pemphigoid antibody titers. Bullous pemphigoid is an autoimmune disorder that can cause blisters on the skin. However, the patient's presentation is not consistent with bullous pemphigoid, so there is no need to check serum bullous pemphigoid antibody titers.
* Answer B: Discontinue lisinopril. Lisinopril is a medication used to treat high blood pressure. It is not known to cause blisters on the skin, so there is no need to discontinue lisinopril.
* Answer C: Measure levels of urine and serum porphyrins. Porphyria is a group of disorders that can cause blisters on the skin. However, the patient's presentation is not consistent with porphyria, so there is no need to measure levels of urine and serum porphyrins.

Explanation:

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with Goodpasture syndrome, a rare autoimmune disease characterized by the production of autoantibodies against the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). This leads to inflammation and damage to the kidneys, which can result in kidney failure. The patient's laboratory results show a positive ANCA test, which is a serological test that is used to diagnose Goodpasture syndrome. The patient's chest x-ray and computed tomography imaging of the chest also show findings that are consistent with Goodpasture syndrome.

Pneumonia with sepsis is a common infection that can cause fever, chills, cough, and shortness of breath. The patient's history and physical examination do not suggest pneumonia with sepsis. Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organs, including the kidneys. The patient's history and physical examination do not suggest SLE. Microscopic polyangiitis is a rare autoimmune disease that can affect the small blood vessels in the lungs, kidneys, and other organs. The patient's history and physical examination do not suggest microscopic polyangiitis.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for the patient is Goodpasture syndrome.

Explanation:

Follicular pityriasis rubra pilaris (FPPR) is a chronic, relapsing, and scarring skin disease characterized by follicular papules, scaling, and erythema. It is most commonly seen in adults, with a female predominance. The exact cause of FPPR is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder.

The clinical presentation of FPPR is variable. The most common findings are follicular papules, scaling, and erythema. The papules are typically small, red, and scaly. They may be round or oval, and they may be follicular or non-follicular. The scaling is typically fine and white. The erythema may be mild or severe, and it may be associated with pruritus.

The diagnosis of FPPR is made based on the clinical presentation and a skin biopsy. The biopsy shows a characteristic perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with follicular plugging.

There is no cure for FPPR, but treatment can help to control the symptoms. Treatment options include topical corticosteroids, oral retinoids, and phototherapy.

The other options are incorrect because they do not present with the characteristic clinical findings of FPPR.

* Follicular psoriasis is a chronic, relapsing, and inflammatory skin disease characterized by well-demarcated, erythematous plaques with silvery scaling. The plaques are typically found on the elbows, knees, scalp, and lower back.
* Follicular mucinosis is a rare, chronic, and progressive skin disease characterized by the deposition of mucin in the follicular epithelium. The lesions are typically small, papular, and erythematous. They may be found on any part of the body, but they are most common on the face, scalp, and upper extremities.
* Follicular lymphomatoid papulosis is a rare, chronic, and non-neoplastic skin disease characterized by the presence of follicular-based lymphocytic infiltrates. The lesions are typically small, papular, and erythematous. They may be found on any part of the body, but they are most common on the trunk and extremities.

Explanation:

The patient in the case presented with a 3-year history of painful nodules on her lower extremities, neck, and jawline. The nodules were skin-colored and firm, and they were associated with no systemic symptoms. A shave biopsy was obtained from one of the nodules, which showed features consistent with fibrofolliculomas. Fibrofolliculomas are a characteristic feature of Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of multiple fibrofolliculomas, trichodiscomas, and acrochordons. Other features of Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome may include renal angiomyolipomas, pulmonary cysts, and lentigenes.

Neurofibromatosis type I (NF1) is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple café-au-lait spots, neurofibromas, and lisch nodules. NF1 is not typically associated with painful nodules.

 71%|███████   | 1080/1525 [4:07:23<1:56:18, 15.68s/it]The answer is: **A: Granuloma annulare**

Explanation:

Granuloma annulare is a common, benign skin condition that is characterized by round or oval, raised, red or skin-colored patches. The patches are often found on the hands, feet, arms, and legs, but they can occur anywhere on the body. Granuloma annulare is usually not itchy or painful, but it can be cosmetically disfiguring.

The cause of granuloma annulare is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune condition. Autoimmune conditions occur when the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissues. In the case of granuloma annulare, the immune system attacks the collagen in the skin.

There is no cure for granuloma annulare, but it usually goes away on its own within a few months or years. In the meantime, treatment may be aimed at reducing the appearance of the patches or relieving any itching or discomfort. Treatment options include topical steroids, oral steroids, and phototherapy (light therapy).

The clinical presentation of the patient in the case is consistent with granuloma annulare. The patient has a 3-year history of a slightly pruritic steadily growing plaque on her right arm. The plaque is 12 cm wide, soft, nontender, and has a raised, nodular, and slightly desquamative erythematoviolaceous border and a clear, atrophic center with an increase in wrinkle depth. There are no other mucosal or skin lesions. The patient's neurological and mental state examination showed no abnormalities. No physical examination was performed specifically to the head and neck. A biopsy specimen that included the border of the lesion was obtained. Histological examination showed a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with granulomatous inflammation. The granulomas were composed of epithelioid cells, multinucleated giant cells, and lymphocytes. Orcein staining showed the presence of elastic fibers within the granulomas. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of granuloma annulare.

Annular elastolytic giant cell granuloma is a rare, benign skin condition that is characterized by annular or serpiginous plaques with central atrophy and atrophic scarring. The lesions are often found on the face, neck, and upper extremities. Annular elastolytic giant cell granuloma is thought to be caused by an autoimmune reaction against elastic fibers in the skin.

Annular lichen planus is a chronic, inflammatory skin condition that is characterized by flat-topped, violaceous papules or plaques. The lesions are often found on the wrists, ankles, hands, feet, and genitals. Annular lichen planus is thought to be an autoimmune condition.

Necrobiosis lipoidica is a chronic, progressive, inflammatory skin condition that is characterized by atrophic plaques with a waxy, yellow appearance. The lesions are often found on the shins. Necrobiosis lipoidica is thought to be a form of vasculitis.

In conclusion, the patient in the case has a clinical presentation that is consistent with granuloma annulare. The other possible diagnoses are not as likely given the patient's history, physical examination, and biopsy findings.

Explanation:
The patient has a diffuse rash present at delivery, which is consistent with neonatal varicella syndrome. The mother was varicella nonimmune, which increases the risk of neonatal varicella syndrome. The rash is widespread and papulovesicular, which is typical of varicella. The palms, soles, and oral mucosa are spared, which is also typical of varicella. The patient is afebrile, which is reassuring. The workup is consistent with varicella, with a positive Tzanck smear and direct fluorescent antibody test for varicella. Treatment with acyclovir is appropriate.

Disseminated herpes infection is a less likely diagnosis, as the patient is not febrile and the rash is not disseminated to the visceral organs. Congenital syphilis is also a less likely diagnosis, as the patient does not have any of the classic signs of congenital syphilis, such as a snuffles, hepatosplenomegaly, or rash.

Explanation: The patient had a history of gallstones and underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. During the surgery, a large stone was spilled into the abdomen and not all of the stones could be retrieved. The patient subsequently developed progressive abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. A CT scan showed a 2.5-cm calcified mass with adjacent inflammatory changes in the left hemiabdomen. This is most consistent with a lost gallstone that has become impacted in the small intestine, causing gallstone ileus. The other options are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms and findings. Intra-abdominal abscess is a collection of pus in the abdomen.

 71%|███████   | 1083/1525 [4:08:01<1:36:09, 13.05s/it]The correct answer is: C. Pancreatic pseudocyst.

Explanation:

A pancreatic pseudocyst is a collection of fluid that forms in the pancreas after an episode of acute pancreatitis. It is a common complication of acute pancreatitis, occurring in up to 30% of cases. Pancreatic pseudocysts are usually asymptomatic, but they can cause pain, nausea, and vomiting. They can also grow large enough to compress surrounding organs, causing symptoms such as abdominal distention and difficulty breathing.

The diagnosis of a pancreatic pseudocyst is made with imaging studies, such as a computed tomography (CT) scan or an abdominal ultrasound. Treatment of a pancreatic pseudocyst depends on the size and symptoms of the cyst. Small, asymptomatic pseudocysts may be managed conservatively with observation and follow-up imaging studies. Larger pseudocysts or those that cause symptoms may be drained percutaneously or surgically.

In this case, the patient has a history of acute pancreatitis and presents with a progressively growing abdominal lump. The physical examination reveals a normothermic, nontender, nonpulsatile, fixed lump in his upper abdomen. A routine blood test reveals leukocytosis, and his serum amylase level is elevated. A contrast-enhanced CT scan of the abdomen reveals a homogeneous collection of fluid encysted by a well-defined enhancing wall. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of pancreatic pseudocyst.

The other answer choices are incorrect. Mesenteric cysts are fluid-filled sacs that develop in the mesentery, which is the tissue that supports the small intestine. Gastric duplication cysts are rare congenital anomalies that result from incomplete separation of the esophagus and stomach during embryological development. Walled-off pancreatic necrosis is a complication of acute pancreatitis in which necrotic tissue becomes walled off from the surrounding healthy tissue.

 71%|███████   | 1084/1525 [4:08:10<1:27:27, 11.90s/it]The correct answer is: D. Perform a pars plana vitrectomy to displace or remove the implant.

The patient is experiencing a large, linear “floater” in his central vision, which is very disturbing to him. On examination, the implant is seen in the middle of the vitreous cavity in a vertical orientation and in the visual axis. The patient was observed for 2 weeks with the hope the implant would settle down or move out of the visual axis, but this did not happen.

In this case, the implant is clearly in the visual axis and is causing significant visual disturbance. It is unlikely that the implant will spontaneously move out of the visual axis. Therefore, the best course of action is to perform a pars plana vitrectomy to displace or remove the implant.

A pars plana vitrectomy is a surgical procedure that is used to remove the vitreous humor, a jelly-like substance that fills the inside of the eye. The vitreous humor can become cloudy or thickened, which can block vision. A pars plana vitrectomy can also be used to remove foreign objects from the eye, repair tears in the retina, or treat other eye conditions.

In this case, the pars plana vitrectomy would be used to remove the fluocinolone acetonide intravitreal implant. The implant would be carefully removed through a small incision in the sclera, the white of the eye. The vitreous humor would then be replaced with a saline solution.

The pars plana vitrectomy is a safe and effective procedure. It is usually performed on an outpatient basis, and patients can usually go home the same day. The recovery time is usually short, and most patients experience good vision after the surgery.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Option A, to continue to observe and hope the implant settles down or moves away from the visual axis, is not a viable option because the implant has already been observed for 2 weeks and has not moved out of the visual axis. Option B, to inject an intravitreous gas bubble to displace the implant, is not a good option because the gas bubble would only be temporary and the implant would likely settle back into the visual axis. Option C, to use a neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser to release the implant, is not a good option because the laser could damage the retina.

The patient has bilateral lens dislocations with lenticulocorneal touch. This is a sight-threatening condition that requires urgent surgical intervention. Pharmacologically dilating the pupils and positioning the patient supinely will not correct the lens dislocation and may actually worsen the condition by increasing the risk of retinal detachment. Referencing the patient for a connective tissue disease workup is not the most appropriate next step as this is not the most likely cause of the patient's lens dislocations.

The patient in the case has a white-yellow mass lesion in the macula of his left eye. This is consistent with a diagnosis of retinoblastoma, a type of cancer that starts in the retina. Retinoblastoma is a rare cancer, but it is the most common type of cancer in children under the age of 2.

The treatment for retinoblastoma typically involves chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. Chemotherapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs to kill cancer cells. Radiation therapy is a type of treatment that uses high-energy rays to kill cancer cells.

In some cases, surgery may also be necessary to remove the tumor. The goal of treatment is to cure the cancer and preserve as much of the child's vision as possible.

The other options are not appropriate for the patient in this case. Option B, examine under anesthesia with peripheral photographs, fluorescein angiography, and laser, is not a treatment option for retinoblastoma. Option C, inject an intravitreous anti–vascular endothelial growth factor medication, is a treatment option for age-related macular degeneration, but it is not a treatment option for retinoblastoma. Option D, perform genetic testing, is not a treatment option for retinoblastoma. However, genetic testing may be helpful to determine if the child has a genetic predisposition to retinoblastoma.

She did not report trauma, changes in vision, or foreign travel and did not take any topical ophthalmic medications. Her medical history was unremarkable. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/25 OD and 20/20 OS. Her pupils were round with no afferent pupillary defect, although the circular lesion did move in concert with the pupillary constriction and dilation. The intraocular pressure was 14 mm Hg OU. Extraocular movements were normal. Slitlamp examination of the anterior segment showed a 2 mm × 2–mm circular iris lesion at the inferotemporal border of the iris. The mass appeared to have a fluid-debris level. When the anterior segment was visualized with a goniolens, we saw that the irideocorneal angle was open, that no neovascularization was present, and that a spherical mass about 2 mm in height arose from the pupillary margin. Its nasal surface appeared white with speckled-brown pigmentation, while the remainder of the lesion had brown pigment. The anterior segment of the left eye and posterior segment of both eyes were unremarkable.

The differential diagnosis for a pigmented iris lesion includes nevi, melanoma, and other tumors. Nevi are the most common type of iris lesion, and they are usually benign. Melanoma is a less common but more serious type of iris lesion, and it can be life-threatening if not treated. Other tumors, such as lymphoma and metastasis, can also occur in the iris.

The next step in the management of this patient is to completely excise the lesion with pathological analysis. This will allow for a definitive diagnosis of the lesion and will ensure that it is completely removed. If the lesion is benign, then no further treatment is necessary. If the lesion is malignant, then additional treatment, such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy, may be necessary.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Option A, observing at yearly intervals, is not appropriate because the lesion is growing and could become malignant. Option B, obtaining high-frequency ultrasound biomicroscopy, is not appropriate because this test cannot provide a definitive diagnosis. Option C, performing transcorneal biopsy of the lesion, is not appropriate because this test can only provide a sample of the lesion, and it is possible that the sample could not contain any malignant cells.

 71%|███████▏  | 1088/1525 [4:08:57<1:31:02, 12.50s/it]The correct answer is: **A. Perform bedside echocardiography**

The patient has a history of heart failure, a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 20%, and atrial fibrillation. He presented with substernal chest pressure of 1-hour duration, radiating to his left arm and occurring at rest. The electrocardiogram (ECG) at presentation revealed atrial fibrillation: concave upward ST-segment elevations of more than 1 mm in the inferior leads, more prominent in lead III than lead II, along with reciprocal ST-segment depressions in the anterior precordial leads. This was suggestive of an acute inferoposterior myocardial infarction (MI), likely from complete occlusion of the right coronary artery (RCA). The coronary angiogram (Figure 1A) confirmed this finding. The left main, the left anterior descending, and the left circumflex coronary arteries were normal. A percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of the mid-RCA occlusion just distal to the right ventricular branch was performed. After the PCI, the chest pain resolved, but the patient’s blood pressure was 90/60 mm Hg. Another ECG (Figure 1B) demonstrated resolution of the ST-segment elevations in the inferior leads with a new rSR′ pattern with concave upward ST-segment elevations in leads V1 to V3.

The new rSR′ pattern with concave upward ST-segment elevations in leads V1 to V3 is suggestive of right ventricular infarction (RVMI). RVMI is a serious complication of MI that can lead to hemodynamic instability and death. It is important to diagnose RVMI early and to treat it aggressively.

Bedside echocardiography is a quick and easy way to assess for RVMI. Echocardiography can show the size and function of the right ventricle, as well as the presence of any right ventricular free wall rupture. Bedside echocardiography can also be used to assess for pericardial effusion, which is another complication of MI that can lead to hemodynamic instability.

Therefore, the next step in management of this patient is to perform bedside echocardiography. This will help to confirm the diagnosis of RVMI and to assess for any other complications of MI.

The other options are not as appropriate in this case. Option B, performing another coronary angiography, is not necessary at this time. The initial coronary angiogram showed that the left main, the left anterior descending, and the left circumflex coronary arteries were normal. The only abnormality was a complete occlusion of the right coronary artery. This occlusion has already been treated with PCI. Option C, performing ECG using posterior leads, is not necessary at this time. The ECG already shows evidence of inferior MI. Option D, performing ECG with right precordial leads, is not necessary at this time. The ECG already shows evidence of right ventricular infarction.

A teratoma is a rare type of tumor that can develop in any part of the body. It is made up of different types of tissue, such as skin, hair, teeth, and bone. Teratomas can be benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous).

In the case of the neonate in the question, the mass was multicystic, with prominent vasculature, and a small area of skin necrosis. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of teratoma.

Lymphangiomas are benign tumors that develop from lymphatic tissue. They are typically soft, compressible masses that are filled with lymph fluid. Lymphangiomas can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the neck, axilla, and groin.

Venous malformations are abnormal collections of veins. They can be present at birth (congenital) or develop later in life (acquired). Venous malformations are typically soft, compressible masses that are filled with blood. They can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the head, neck, and trunk.

Dermoid cysts are benign tumors that develop from skin cells. They are typically small, round, or oval masses that are filled with hair, skin, and other tissue. Dermoid cysts can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common on the head, neck, and face.

In the case of the neonate in the question, the mass was multicystic, with prominent vasculature, and a small area of skin necrosis. These findings are not consistent with a diagnosis of lymphangioma, venous malformation, or dermoid cyst. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is teratoma.

A keratocystic odontogenic tumor (KCOT) is a benign odontogenic tumor that is often misdiagnosed as a dentigerous cyst or an ameloblastoma. It is the most common odontogenic cyst in adults, and it typically occurs in the second or third decade of life. KCOTs are usually found in the mandible, and they are often associated with an unerupted tooth.

The characteristic radiographic features of a KCOT include a well-defined radiolucent lesion with a thin radiopaque rim. The lesion may be unilocular or multilocular, and it may have a scalloped border. KCOTs are typically not associated with root resorption or cortical expansion.

The histopathologic features of a KCOT include a cystic cavity lined by a stratified squamous epithelium with parakeratosis. The cyst may also contain keratin debris and inflammatory cells. The stroma of the tumor is typically fibrous, and it may contain islands of odontogenic epithelium.

The treatment for a KCOT is surgical excision. The goal of surgery is to remove the entire tumor with a margin of healthy tissue. KCOTs have a good prognosis, and they rarely recur after treatment.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not describe the clinical and radiographic features of the patient's tumor. Lymphangioma is a benign tumor of lymphatic vessels. It is usually found in the head and neck region, and it can be cystic or solid. Lymphangiomas are often diagnosed in childhood.

Ameloblastoma is a locally aggressive odontogenic tumor. It is the most common odontogenic tumor in adults. Ameloblastomas are typically found in the mandible, and they are often associated with an unerupted tooth.

Schwannoma is a benign tumor of Schwann cells. It is the most common peripheral nerve tumor. Schwannomas can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the head and neck region.

The patient has a history of breast adenocarcinoma, which is a common cancer that can metastasize to the bones. The patient's current symptoms of frontal headaches, forehead nodules, and right proptosis are consistent with metastatic breast cancer to the skull. The physical examination findings of soft, tender nodules at the forehead and right orbit with right proptosis are also consistent with metastatic breast cancer. The imaging findings of a soft-tissue mass with involvement of multiple craniofacial bones with orbital, anterior, and posterior table defects are also consistent with metastatic breast cancer. The FNA biopsy showed loose billowing clusters of epithelial cells involved by strands of magenta extracellular tissue, which is a characteristic finding of metastatic breast cancer. The hematoxylin-eosin staining showed cells with abundant clear cytoplasm and nuclei with varying nucleolar prominence, which is also a characteristic finding of metastatic breast cancer. The immunohistochemical stains were positive for pancytokeratin, vimentin, CD10 and PAX-8, which are all markers of epithelial cells. The carbonic anhydrase IX (CA-IX) stain was noncontributory, which is consistent with the diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer.

The other options are incorrect. Locally aggressive fibrous dysplasia is a benign condition that does not typically metastasize. Metastatic renal cell carcinoma is a common cancer that can metastasize to the bones, but it is not typically associated with the frontal headaches, forehead nodules, and right proptosis that this patient is experiencing. Osteosarcoma is a rare type of bone cancer that typically occurs in children and young adults. It is not typically associated with a history of breast adenocarcinoma.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. The computed tomography image shows an abnormal mass in the site of the left temporal scalp lesion, which is consistent with a basal cell carcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma. The biopsy shows an epidermal proliferative process with vertically oriented anastomosing strands of basaloid epithelium, which is consistent with a basal cell carcinoma. The biopsy also shows concurrent well-differentiated carcinoma, which is consistent with a squamous cell carcinoma.

Syringofibroadenocarcinoma is a rare, malignant tumor of the skin that is characterized by the proliferation of syringofibroadenoma-like cells. Eccrine syringofibroadenoma is a benign tumor of the skin that is characterized by the proliferation of eccrine ductal cells. Eccrine poroma is a benign tumor of the skin that is characterized by the proliferation of eccrine porocytes.

The patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with syringofibroadenocarcinoma, eccrine syringofibroadenoma, or eccrine poroma. The computed tomography image shows an abnormal mass in the site of the left temporal scalp lesion, which is not consistent with syringofibroadenocarcinoma, eccrine syringofibroadenoma, or eccrine poroma.

Explanation:

The patient is a man in his 20s with a 9-month history of a nonhealing submental ulcer. The area is nontender, bleeds with manipulation, and appears to be fixed to the underlying mandible. Examination of the oral cavity reveals caries and periodontal disease. There is no palpable cervical adenopathy.

The biopsy shows epithelioid or spindle-shaped tumor cells with atypical vesicular nuclei and pale eosinophilic cytoplasm with areas of necrosis. Tumor cells stain strongly positive for EMA, CD34, and pankeratin and demonstrate loss of INI-1 immunostaining.

These findings are most consistent with epithelioid sarcoma. Epithelioid sarcoma is a rare, malignant soft tissue tumor that typically occurs in young adults. It is characterized by epithelioid or spindle-shaped tumor cells with atypical vesicular nuclei and pale eosinophilic cytoplasm. The tumor often has areas of necrosis and hemorrhage. Epithelioid sarcoma can metastasize to lymph nodes and lungs.

Histiocytoma is a benign tumor of histiocytes, which are white blood cells that play a role in the immune system. Histiocytomas can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the skin. They are typically small, painless lesions that do not require treatment.

Nodular fasciitis is a benign, self-limiting soft tissue tumor that typically occurs in young adults. It is characterized by a rapid growth of a firm, nontender mass. Nodular fasciitis usually resolves spontaneously within a few months.

Squamous cell carcinoma is a malignant tumor of epithelial cells, which are the cells that line the skin and other organs. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer. It can also occur in the mouth, throat, esophagus, lung, vagina, and cervix. Squamous cell carcinoma is typically treated with surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.

The patient's history, physical examination, and biopsy findings are most consistent with epithelioid sarcoma. The other options are less likely given the patient's presentation.

 72%|███████▏  | 1094/1525 [4:10:23<1:39:55, 13.91s/it]The correct answer is: **B: Evaluate for primary adrenal insufficiency with a 250-μg corticotropin stimulation test.**

The patient in the case presents with chronic fatigue and weight loss, as well as darkening of the palmar creases and buccal mucosa. These are all signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency. Primary adrenal insufficiency is caused by a deficiency of the adrenal glands, which produce the hormone cortisol. Cortisol is essential for the body's response to stress, and a deficiency can lead to a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, weight loss, and darkening of the skin.

The 250-μg corticotropin stimulation test is a test that is used to diagnose primary adrenal insufficiency. The test involves administering a dose of the hormone corticotropin (ACTH) and then measuring the patient's blood cortisol levels. If the patient's cortisol levels do not increase after ACTH administration, this is a sign of primary adrenal insufficiency.

The other options are incorrect because they do not address the patient's primary symptoms. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a genetic disorder that causes the adrenal glands to produce too much of the hormone cortisol. This can lead to a variety of symptoms, including virilization (development of male characteristics in females), growth retardation, and seizures. However, congenital adrenal hyperplasia does not typically cause chronic fatigue or weight loss.

A pituitary adenoma is a tumor that grows on the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland is located at the base of the brain and produces a variety of hormones, including ACTH. If a pituitary adenoma grows too large, it can suppress the production of ACTH, which can lead to adrenal insufficiency. However, the patient in the case does not have any symptoms that suggest a pituitary adenoma, such as headache, visual disturbances, or hormonal changes.

A laboratory error is always a possibility, but it is unlikely in this case. The patient's symptoms are consistent with adrenal insufficiency, and the laboratory tests were performed in a reliable laboratory. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the patient's symptoms is primary adrenal insufficiency.

Explanation: Urticarial vasculitis is a type of vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels) that causes hives (urticaria) and swelling (edema). It is often associated with sun exposure. The clinical images show edema with petechial eruption on the hands and feet, which are consistent with the diagnosis of urticaria vasculitis. The pathologic images show subtle thickening of vessel walls, in addition to extravasation of erythrocytes and fibrin thrombus formation, which are also consistent with the diagnosis of urticaria vasculitis. Hereditary angioedema is a genetic disorder that causes episodes of swelling of the skin, mucous membranes, and gastrointestinal tract. It is not associated with sun exposure. Erythropoietic protoporphyria is a rare genetic disorder that causes photosensitivity, abdominal pain, and skin lesions. It is not associated with hives or vasculitis.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2b (MEN2b), a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple mucosal neuromas, pheochromocytoma, medullary thyroid carcinoma, and other tumors. The patient's marfanoid habitus, disproportion of limbs, and enlarged face are also consistent with MEN2b. The presence of multiple pink-whitish and translucent nodules on the lateral and anterior surface of the tongue is a characteristic finding of MEN2b. Biopsy results from tongue tissue showed the presence of multiple neuromas, which are benign tumors of nerve tissue. These findings are highly suggestive of MEN2b.

Melkersson-Rosenthal syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by recurrent facial paralysis, fissured tongue, and cheilitis.

Bacillary angiomatosis is a rare, non-neoplastic vascular proliferation caused by infection with Bartonella henselae or Bartonella quintana. It is most commonly seen in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, but can also occur in patients with other immunosuppressive conditions, such as organ transplantation or hematologic malignancy.

The characteristic skin lesions of bacillary angiomatosis are purplish papules or nodules that often coalesce to form larger plaques. The lesions are typically non-tender and do not ulcerate. They may be located anywhere on the body, but are most common on the extremities, face, and trunk.

The diagnosis of bacillary angiomatosis is made by biopsy of a lesion. The histopathologic findings are characteristic, showing a proliferation of small, irregular blood vessels. The organisms can be identified by special stains or culture.

The treatment of bacillary angiomatosis is with antibiotics. The most commonly used antibiotics are erythromycin, azithromycin, and ciprofloxacin. Treatment is usually successful, but the lesions may recur if the underlying immunosuppression is not treated.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not fit the clinical presentation of the patient. Kaposi sarcoma is a vascular tumor that is seen in patients with HIV infection. It typically presents as multiple purplish lesions on the skin, mucous membranes, or gastrointestinal tract. Disseminated tinea infection is a fungal infection of the skin that can cause multiple papules or nodules. Leukemia cutis is a rare, leukemic infiltration of the skin. It typically presents as multiple red or purple papules or nodules.

Explanation:
The patient's history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, coronary artery disease, right-lung empyema with decortication, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease puts him at risk for developing metastatic carcinoma. The MRI findings of an intra-axial necrotic lesion with adjacent vasculogenic edema primarily involving the right posterior frontal and anterior parietal lobes are consistent with a metastatic brain tumor. The patient's symptoms of slurred speech, left-sided facial droop, numbness and weakness in his left arm, and difficulty with multistep commands are also consistent with a metastatic brain tumor. Hemorrhagic brain infarct is unlikely because the patient does not have any history of bleeding disorders or trauma. Nocardial brain abscess is unlikely because the patient does not have any risk factors for nocardial infection, such as immunosuppression or exposure to contaminated water. Mixed bacterial abscess is unlikely because the patient does not have any fever or other signs of infection.

Explanation:

The patient is an 84-year-old woman with a history of hypertension who presents with 2 days of progressive abdominal distention, nausea, anorexia, and crampy abdominal pain. She has no gross abnormalities in the perineal area. Her laboratory results indicate a white blood cell count of 11670/μL, a sodium level of 132 mEq/L, and a creatinine level of 0.6 mg/dL. Abdominal radiography reveals segmental dilatation of the small bowel. Further evaluation with computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis shows a mass lesion in the right lower pelvic wall.

The most likely diagnosis is an obturator hernia. Obturator hernias are rare, accounting for only 1-2% of all hernias. They occur when a loop of bowel or omentum herniates through the obturator foramen, which is a natural opening in the pelvis. This can cause abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and constipation. In some cases, the herniated bowel can become obstructed, which can be a life-threatening condition.

The diagnosis of an obturator hernia is often made on imaging studies, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. Treatment typically involves surgical repair of the hernia.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely in this patient. Acute lymphadenitis is a condition in which the lymph nodes become inflamed. It is usually caused by an infection, such as a viral infection or a bacterial infection. Femoral hernias and inguinal hernias are types of groin hernias. They occur when a loop of bowel or omentum herniates through a weak spot in the abdominal wall in the groin area. These hernias are more common in men than in women.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is an obturator hernia. The other possible diagnoses are less likely.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is consistent with a retroperitoneal mass, which is a common finding in renal cell carcinoma. The patient's history of generalized weakness and bilateral lower extremity swelling is also consistent with renal cell carcinoma, as these symptoms are often caused by the tumor's growth and spread to the lungs or other organs. The CT scan findings of a large, retroperitoneal mass that envelops the left kidney without evidence of hydronephrosis are also consistent with renal cell carcinoma.

Retroperitoneal fibrosis (Ormond disease) is a rare disorder characterized by the formation of fibrous tissue in the retroperitoneum. This can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, back pain, and constipation. However, retroperitoneal fibrosis does not typically cause lower extremity edema or a large, retroperitoneal mass.

Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are rare tumors that can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract. GISTs can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, bleeding, and weight loss. However, GISTs do not typically cause lower extremity edema or a large, retroperitoneal mass.

Retroperitoneal liposarcoma is a rare type of cancer that can occur in the fat tissue of the retroperitoneum. Retroperitoneal liposarcoma can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, back pain, and weight loss. However, retroperitoneal liposarcoma does not typically cause lower extremity edema or a large, retroperitoneal mass.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is renal cell carcinoma.

 72%|███████▏  | 1101/1525 [4:11:49<1:35:29, 13.51s/it]The correct answer is: **C. Perform vitrectomy**.

Explanation:

The patient has a history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes and has undergone vitrectomy in both eyes for nonclearing vitreous hemorrhage. On postoperative day 3, he noted decreased visual acuity in the left eye. On examination, visual acuity was hand motion, and intraocular pressure was 17 mm Hg. The anterior chamber had minimal inflammation. Extensive strands and veils were noted throughout the vitreous cavity.

These findings are consistent with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR), a condition that can develop after vitrectomy. PVR is characterized by the formation of fibrovascular tissue in the vitreous cavity, which can contract and cause retinal detachment.

The treatment for PVR is vitrectomy with removal of the fibrovascular tissue. In this case, the patient's visual acuity is already severely decreased, and further delay in treatment could lead to permanent blindness. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to perform vitrectomy.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Increasing topical steroids would not be effective in treating PVR. Intravitreal antibiotics are only indicated for infection, which is not present in this case. Injecting an antifungal drug would also not be effective, as PVR is not caused by an infection.

Explanation:

The patient has a chronic progressive left homonymous visual field defect, which is a classic presentation of occipital lobe disease. The MRI scan showed profound cortical atrophy of the parieto-occipital lobes, which is also consistent with occipital lobe disease. The patient also has some recent difficulties with short-term memory and reports easily getting lost when driving, which are both signs of cognitive impairment. Neuropsychological testing can help to assess the extent of the patient's cognitive impairment and to identify the specific cognitive domains that are affected. This information can be used to develop a treatment plan that is tailored to the patient's individual needs.

Lumbar puncture and fluorescein angiography are not indicated in this case. Lumbar puncture is typically used to diagnose conditions such as meningitis, encephalitis, and multiple sclerosis. Fluorescein angiography is typically used to diagnose conditions such as retinal detachment and macular degeneration. In this case, the patient's MRI scan and history are already consistent with a diagnosis of occipital lobe disease, so further testing is not necessary.

Repeat MRI may be considered in the future to monitor the progression of the disease, but it is not necessary at this time.

The patient has elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) and endothelial cell loss following iris color change. Elevated IOP can damage the optic nerve and lead to vision loss. Endothelial cell loss can cause corneal edema and visual disturbances.

The first step in management is to reduce the IOP. This can be done with topical medications, such as beta-blockers, carbonic anhydrase inhibitors, or alpha agonists. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to lower the IOP.

Once the IOP is controlled, it is important to monitor the patient's visual field. Visual field testing can detect early signs of optic nerve damage. If the visual field is abnormal, the patient may need to undergo further treatment to protect their vision.

Recommending increased frequency of ocular surface lubrication and anti-inflammatory medications is not the best option because it will not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Recommending a surgical intervention that will return his eyes to their original color is not the best option because it is not necessary and could potentially worsen the patient's condition.

Therefore, the best course of action is to adjust topical medications to decrease intraocular pressure and perform visual field testing.

The patient has a history of pituitary adenoma resection and external beam radiation, which is known to cause cranial nerve palsies. The patient's current presentation, with intermittent esotropia of the right eye, is concerning for a recurrent pituitary adenoma. An urgent MRI is the most appropriate next step to evaluate for a recurrent tumor.

Topical apraclonidine test is not indicated in this case, as it is used to evaluate for Horner's syndrome. Horner's syndrome is characterized by ptosis, miosis, and anhidrosis on the ipsilateral side of the face. The patient in this case does not have anhidrosis, so Horner's syndrome is not a likely diagnosis.

Carbamazepine is a medication that is used to treat seizures and trigeminal neuralgia. It is not indicated for the treatment of pituitary adenomas.

Extraocular muscle surgery is not indicated in this case, as the patient's esotropia is intermittent and not causing significant visual impairment. Extraocular muscle surgery is typically reserved for patients with persistent diplopia.

In conclusion, the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is an urgent MRI to evaluate for a recurrent pituitary adenoma.

Sweet syndrome, also known as acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, is a rare, self-limited, febrile neutrophilic dermatosis characterized by fever, tender erythematous plaques or nodules, and leukocytosis. It is associated with a variety of underlying conditions, including infections, malignancies, and connective tissue diseases.

The patient in the case presented with a painful rash on his elbows, forearms, and legs, which is consistent with the cutaneous findings of Sweet syndrome. He also had a fever and leukocytosis, which are common laboratory findings in Sweet syndrome. The punch biopsy showed a dermal neutrophilic infiltrate, which is the characteristic histologic finding of Sweet syndrome.

The other possible diagnoses are not as likely in this case. Pyoderma gangrenosum is a chronic, destructive, neutrophilic dermatosis that is associated with underlying inflammatory bowel disease, hematologic malignancies, and other conditions. Papillary dermal edema is a benign condition characterized by edema of the papillary dermis. Pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta is a chronic, papulosquamous eruption of unknown etiology.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for the patient in the case is Sweet syndrome.

The patient is a young woman with recurrent atrial fibrillation (AF). She has a history of chest pain and exertional dyspnea, and her electrocardiogram shows a prolonged QT interval. These findings suggest that she may have an underlying arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy.

An electrophysiology study (EPS) is a procedure that is used to diagnose and treat arrhythmias. During an EPS, electrodes are placed in the heart to record electrical activity. The EPS can be used to identify the source of the arrhythmia and to test the effectiveness of different treatments.

AF ablation is a procedure that is used to destroy the areas of the heart that are causing the arrhythmia. AF ablation is a safe and effective treatment for AF.

In this case, the patient is young and has a good chance of being cured of her arrhythmia with AF ablation. Therefore, the best course of action is to proceed with an EPS and AF ablation.

The other options are not appropriate for this patient. Option A (start diuretic, β-blocker, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor) is a treatment for heart failure, which the patient does not have. Option B (start diuretic, implant cardioverter defibrillator, and evaluate for cardiac transplantation) is a treatment for advanced heart failure, which the patient does not have. Option C (discontinue flecainide, start amiodarone and warfarin) is a treatment for atrial fibrillation, but it is not as effective as AF ablation.

 73%|███████▎  | 1107/1525 [4:13:06<1:32:16, 13.25s/it]The answer is: D. Nodular fasciitis.

Explanation:

Nodular fasciitis is a benign, self-limiting soft tissue tumor that typically occurs in young adults. It is characterized by a rapid onset and growth, followed by spontaneous regression over a period of weeks to months. The tumor is most commonly located in the extremities, but it can occur in any part of the body.

The diagnosis of nodular fasciitis is made on clinical grounds, supported by imaging studies and histopathologic examination. The tumor is typically well-circumscribed and has a lobulated appearance. Histologically, it is composed of a proliferation of spindle cells in a myxoid stroma. The cells are positive for actin and negative for cytokeratin and S100 protein.

Nodular fasciitis is a benign tumor that does not require treatment. However, if the tumor is large or causing symptoms, it may be removed surgically. The prognosis for nodular fasciitis is excellent, with complete resolution of the tumor in most cases.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are all malignant tumors. Proliferative myositis is a rare, inflammatory disorder of skeletal muscle that can be mistaken for a sarcoma. Myositis ossificans is a benign, self-limiting condition in which muscle tissue ossifies. Low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma is a rare, malignant tumor that typically occurs in adults.

Explanation:

Odontogenic myxofibroma is a benign odontogenic tumor that is characterized by a proliferation of stellate spindled cells with a variable extracellular matrix ranging from loose myxoid to fibromyxoid and collagenous. The lesion is typically found in the posterior mandible of young adults and may cause expansion of the jaw and tooth displacement. Histologically, odontogenic myxofibroma is similar to fibrous dysplasia, but it does not have the characteristic woven bone seen in fibrous dysplasia. Ameloblastic fibroma is a benign odontogenic tumor that is characterized by the presence of odontogenic epithelium and stellate reticulum. Giant cell granuloma is a benign inflammatory lesion that is characterized by a proliferation of giant cells.

In this case, the patient is a young boy with a 2-month history of a progressively enlarging right facial mass. The mass is associated with the roots of the upper molar and premolar teeth, and it has eroded through the anterior maxillary wall and some thinning and displacement of the inferior orbital wall. The lesion was excised via a sublabial approach using both open and endoscopic techniques for better visualization. Histopathologic analysis revealed a bland, monotonous proliferation of stellate spindled cells with a variable extracellular matrix ranging from loose myxoid to fibromyxoid and collagenous. There was also permeation of adjacent bone marrow spaces. These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of odontogenic myxofibroma.

Explanation:
The patient is a woman in her 50s with a history of ulcerative colitis who presented with severe diffuse sore throat associated with fevers, chills, night sweats, and neck swelling of 2 weeks’ duration. Results from a rapid strep test were negative, and observation was initiated for presumed viral pharyngitis. Progression of neck swelling led to empirical treatment for bacterial pharyngitis. A neck computed tomographic scan with contrast revealed large bilateral asymmetric conglomerations of necrotic cervical lymph nodes measuring up to 9 cm in the greatest dimension. Four weeks after symptom onset, the patient was referred to the otolaryngology service. Initial evaluation, including fiber-optic laryngoscopy, revealed the presence of significant bilateral tender lymphadenopathy in the absence of any lesions in the upper aerodigestive tract. A core biopsy specimen yielded negative gram stain and aerobic and anaerobic bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast bacillus cultures. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of nodal contents was negative for Bartonella henselae. A chest radiograph was normal. Necrotic skin changes and persistent purulent neck drainage through the needle biopsy site required incision and drainage as well as incisional biopsy of the left side of her neck. Operative findings included abundant purulent debris and considerable necrosis of skin and neck musculature. All the cultures once again returned with no growth. Final pathologic examination showed necrotizing granulomatous inflammation with no monoclonal lymphocyte population on flow cytometry. Results from a test for human immunodeficiency virus and angiotensin-converting enzyme testing were negative. Francisella tularensis serum antibody titers were 1:640.

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is tularemia. Tularemia is a zoonosis caused by the bacterium Francisella tularensis. It is typically transmitted to humans through contact with infected animals or their tissues, or through the bite of an infected tick. The most common clinical presentation of tularemia is an ulceroglandular form, which is characterized by fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, and a painful skin ulcer at the site of infection. Lymphadenopathy is common, and the lymph nodes may become necrotic. Other possible clinical manifestations of tularemia include pneumonic, typhoidal, and oculoglandular forms.

The diagnosis of tularemia is made serologically, with a fourfold rise in antibody titers to F. tularensis. The organism can also be cultured from blood, lymph node aspirates, or sputum.

Treatment of tularemia is with antibiotics, such as streptomycin or doxycycline. In severe cases, hospitalization may be necessary.

The prognosis for tularemia is generally good with appropriate treatment. However, the disease can be fatal in up to 5% of cases.

The other possible diagnoses in this patient are tuberculous lymphadenitis, Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease, and cat-scratch disease. However, these diagnoses are less likely based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings.

Tuberculous lymphadenitis is a chronic infection of the lymph nodes caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is typically seen in children and young adults. The most common clinical presentation is a painless, enlarged lymph node. Other possible manifestations include fever, night sweats, and weight loss. The diagnosis is made by biopsy of the lymph node, which shows caseating granulomas. Treatment is with antituberculosis drugs.

Kikuchi-Fujimoto disease is a rare, self-limiting inflammatory condition of the lymph nodes. It is typically seen in young women. The most common clinical presentation is fever, lymphadenopathy, and skin rash. Other possible manifestations include fatigue, weight loss, and arthralgias. The diagnosis is made by clinical presentation and exclusion of other causes. Treatment is supportive.

Cat-scratch disease is a zoonotic infection caused by Bartonella henselae. It is typically transmitted to humans through the bite of a cat flea. The most common clinical presentation is a regional lymphadenopathy, often accompanied by fever, headache, and fatigue. Other possible manifestations include a skin lesion at the site of the bite, conjunctivitis, and hepatosplenomegaly. The diagnosis is made serologically, with a positive antibody titer to B. henselae. Treatment is generally not necessary, as the disease is self-limiting. However, antibiotics may be given in severe cases.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), previously known as Wegener granulomatosis, is a rare autoimmune disease that affects the blood vessels, lungs, kidneys, and other organs. It is characterized by the presence of non-necrotizing granulomas, which are small collections of inflammatory cells, in the affected tissues. GPA can be life-threatening, but it is treatable with a combination of medications, including corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab.

The patient in the case presentation meets several criteria for a diagnosis of GPA. First, he has a history of sinusitis, which is a common symptom of GPA. Second, he has bilateral parotid enlargement, which is another common symptom of GPA. Third, he has a positive test result for non-caseating granulomatous inflammation on a superficial parotid biopsy, which is a definitive diagnostic test for GPA.

Tuberculosis is a bacterial infection that can cause a variety of symptoms, including fever, cough, and weight loss. It is not typically associated with sinusitis, parotid enlargement, or non-caseating granulomatous inflammation.

Sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect any organ in the body. It is characterized by the presence of non-caseating granulomas in the affected tissues. Sarcoidosis can cause a variety of symptoms, including fever, fatigue, and joint pain. It is not typically associated with sinusitis, parotid enlargement, or non-caseating granulomatous inflammation.

Amyloidosis is a group of diseases characterized by the deposition of amyloid, a protein, in the tissues and organs. Amyloidosis can cause a variety of symptoms, depending on the organs that are affected. It is not typically associated with sinusitis, parotid enlargement, or non-caseating granulomatous inflammation.

In conclusion, the patient in the case presentation meets several criteria for a diagnosis of GPA. GPA is a rare autoimmune disease that affects the blood vessels, lungs, kidneys, and other organs. It is characterized by the presence of non-caseating granulomas, which are small collections of inflammatory cells, in the affected tissues. GPA can be life-threatening, but it is treatable with a combination of medications.

Explanation:

The patient is a nonsmoking man in his 40s with hypertension and diabetes mellitus type 2 who reported a 1-year history of a mass in the region of his left parotid gland that had been steadily increasing in size. There was no associated pain, facial numbness, or weakness. Multiple aspirations of the mass had been performed, which would temporarily decrease the size. On examination, the mass was freely mobile, the facial nerve was intact bilaterally, and there was no palpable lymphadenopathy. Results from fine-needle aspiration 6 months prior to presentation were consistent with a cystic oncocytic neoplasm, and computed tomography revealed a 1.9 × 1.5 × 2.1-cm, well-circumscribed ovoid lesion in the anterior aspect of the superficial lobe of the left parotid gland. A left superficial parotidectomy was performed under general anesthesia with facial nerve dissection and facial nerve monitoring. No complications were encountered. Postoperative pathological analysis revealed a cystic, cribriform, papillary neoplastic growth with low-grade cytologic features and nearly complete myoepithelial rims. Calponin and p63 staining were positive in the myoepithelium surrounding the tumor nests, S-100 was positive within the tumor, and the Ki-67 rate was approximately 5%. Extracellular mucin and occasional mucous cells were also noted. Margins were clear, and there was no evidence of perineural spread or lymphovascular invasion. The patient tolerated the procedure well, recovered appropriately, and was free of complications at his first follow-up appointment.

The differential diagnosis for a cystic parotid lesion in a middle-aged man includes papillary cystic acinic cell carcinoma, low-grade cribriform cystadenocarcinoma, Warthin tumor, and mammary analogue secretory carcinoma.

Papillary cystic acinic cell carcinoma is a rare, low-grade salivary gland tumor that typically occurs in the parotid gland. It is characterized by a cystic papillary architecture with acinic cell differentiation. The tumor is usually well-circumscribed and has a low risk of metastasis.

Low-grade cribriform cystadenocarcinoma is another rare, low-grade salivary gland tumor that typically occurs in the parotid gland. It is characterized by a cribriform papillary architecture with ductal differentiation. The tumor is usually well-circumscribed and has a low risk of metastasis.

Warthin tumor is a benign, mixed tumor of the parotid gland. It is characterized by a combination of oncocytic epithelial cells and lymphoid stroma. The tumor is usually well-circumscribed and has a low risk of recurrence.

Mammary analogue secretory carcinoma is a rare, high-grade salivary gland tumor that typically occurs in the parotid gland. It is characterized by a cribriform papillary architecture with secretory cell differentiation. The tumor is usually poorly-circumscribed and has a high risk of metastasis.

The patient in the case presented has a cystic parotid lesion with a low-grade cribriform papillary architecture and nearly complete myoepithelial rims. These features are characteristic of low-grade cribriform cystadenocarcinoma. The tumor is also positive for calponin and p63, which are myoepithelial markers. This further supports the diagnosis of low-grade cribriform cystadenocarcinoma.

The differential diagnosis for the patient's lesion also includes papillary cystic acinic cell carcinoma and Warthin tumor. However, these tumors are less likely to have a cribriform papillary architecture and are less likely to be positive for calponin and p63. Mammary analogue secretory carcinoma is a high-grade tumor that is not typically associated with a cribriform papillary architecture.

In conclusion, the patient's lesion is most likely a low-grade cribriform cystadenocarcinoma. This diagnosis is supported by the patient's clinical presentation, the tumor's histopathology, and the immunohistochemical staining results.

The patient has cutaneous necrosis of the ears, which is a serious condition that can be caused by a variety of diseases. A skin biopsy is the most accurate way to diagnose the cause of the necrosis and to determine the best course of treatment. The biopsy will allow the doctor to examine the tissue under a microscope to look for signs of infection, autoimmune disease, or other possible causes of the necrosis.

The other options are incorrect because they are not as accurate or as helpful in diagnosing the cause of the necrosis. Obtaining serum antinuclear antibody and lupus anticoagulant assay can help to diagnose autoimmune diseases, but these tests are not always positive in patients with cutaneous necrosis. Obtaining a bacterial culture of the skin lesions can help to diagnose infection, but this test is not always positive in patients with cutaneous necrosis. Obtaining a urine drug screen is not helpful in diagnosing cutaneous necrosis.

In conclusion, the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is to perform a skin biopsy with indirect immunofluorescence. This will allow the doctor to diagnose the cause of the necrosis and to determine the best course of treatment.

The patient has a history of undifferentiated connective tissue disease and long-standing pulmonary arterial hypertension. These conditions can both lead to right-sided heart failure, which can cause ascites. The patient's physical examination findings are also consistent with right-sided heart failure, including jugular venous distension and a regular heart rate and rhythm with an accentuated P2. The Doppler ultrasound findings of an irregular liver echo pattern without lesions, normal common bile duct, patent portal and hepatic vasculature, splenomegaly, and ascites are also consistent with right-sided heart failure. The laboratory results, including the white blood cell count and differential, are not specific for any one cause of ascites. However, the elevated protein concentration in the ascitic fluid suggests that the ascites is not due to portal hypertension. The ascitic fluid culture is negative, which rules out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's ascites is chronically elevated pressures on the right side of the heart.

The patient's presentation is consistent with a drug reaction, particularly a hypersensitivity reaction to azathioprine. The rash is the most concerning finding, as it is a common manifestation of drug hypersensitivity reactions. The other findings, such as the fevers, arthralgias, and elevated inflammatory markers, are non-specific and could be due to a variety of conditions.

A punch skin biopsy is the most definitive way to diagnose a drug reaction. The biopsy can be used to identify the specific drug that is causing the reaction, which can help to guide treatment. In this case, the biopsy would likely show a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate, which is a characteristic finding of drug hypersensitivity reactions.

The other options are not as appropriate in this case. Checking angiotensin-converting enzyme level is not helpful in diagnosing a drug reaction. Stopping azathioprine is a reasonable option, but it is important to first confirm that the rash is due to a drug reaction. Starting corticosteroids is also a reasonable option, but it is important to first confirm that the rash is due to a drug reaction.

Therefore, the best course of action is to perform a punch skin biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of a drug reaction.

Explanation:

Lynch syndrome is an inherited condition that increases the risk of developing certain types of cancer, including endometrial cancer. It is caused by mutations in genes that are involved in DNA mismatch repair. These mutations can be inherited from a parent or they can occur spontaneously.

To diagnose Lynch syndrome, doctors look for certain features in a person's medical history and family history. They may also order genetic testing. Genetic testing can look for mutations in the genes that are known to cause Lynch syndrome.

The woman in the case study has a family history of prostate cancer, which is one of the cancers that is associated with Lynch syndrome. She also has endometrial cancer, which is another cancer that is associated with Lynch syndrome. However, her tumor was not tested for Lynch syndrome. Therefore, it is not possible to say for sure whether or not she has Lynch syndrome.

If the woman's tumor had been tested for Lynch syndrome, the results could have been:

* Positive: This would mean that the woman has a mutation in one of the genes that is known to cause Lynch syndrome.
* Negative: This would mean that the woman does not have a mutation in any of the genes that are known to cause Lynch syndrome.
* Indeterminate: This would mean that the test results were inconclusive.

If the woman's tumor had tested positive for Lynch syndrome, this would have been strong evidence that she has the condition. However, a negative test result does not necessarily mean that she does not have Lynch syndrome. This is because there are other conditions that can cause similar symptoms to Lynch syndrome. Additionally, some people with Lynch syndrome do not have any family history of cancer.

If the woman's tumor had tested indeterminate, this would mean that it is not possible to say for sure whether or not she has Lynch syndrome. In this case, the doctor may recommend further testing, such as genetic testing.

If the woman is concerned about her risk of cancer, she should talk to her doctor about Lynch syndrome. She should also be aware of the symptoms of cancer and see her doctor right away if she notices any changes.

Explanation:
The patient in this case presents with a number of features that are consistent with secondary syphilis. These include the abrupt onset of multiple pruritic crusted papules and nodules on the face and genitals, which have a central umbilication and erosions. The patient also has a history of cocaine use, which is a risk factor for secondary syphilis. The physical examination findings are also consistent with secondary syphilis, with multiple skin-colored papules, nodules, and vegetative plaques ranging in size from 4 to 6 mm in diameter. The lesions are also sparing of the palms and soles, which is a characteristic feature of secondary syphilis. The biopsy findings are also consistent with secondary syphilis, with a Warthin-Starry silver impregnation stain showing spirochetes in the skin.

Atypical mycobacterium infection is a less likely diagnosis in this case, as it typically presents with papules, nodules, and ulcers that are more widespread and less likely to be umbilicated. Cryptococcal infection is also a less likely diagnosis, as it typically presents with fever, headache, and meningismus. Eruptive keratoacanthomas are a rare skin condition that can present with multiple papules and nodules, but they are typically not umbilicated or erosive.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is secondary syphilis.

Explanation:

The patient is a middle-aged woman with a history of Crohn disease (CD). She presents with painful perianal skin growths that have been present for 1 year. Physical examination reveals a tender perianal plaque with a papular, cobblestone-like surface. A biopsy specimen from the perianal plaque was obtained, and histopathology revealed a dermal perivascular and nodular infiltrate composed of aggregates of histiocytes and numerous multinucleate giant cells surrounded by mature lymphocytes. Acid-fast and silver stains were negative.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of granulomatous manifestation of inflammatory bowel disease. Granulomatous inflammation is a characteristic feature of CD, and it can occur in any organ system, including the skin. The perianal region is a common site for granulomatous lesions in patients with CD.

The other answer choices are incorrect. Fibroepithelial polyps are benign skin tumors that are not associated with CD. External hemorrhoids are varicose veins in the anal canal, and they are not associated with granulomatous inflammation. Condyloma acuminata are sexually transmitted lesions that are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). They are not associated with CD.

Explanation:

Cutaneous sparganosis is a parasitic infection caused by the larvae of the tapeworm Spirometra erinaceieuropaei. The larvae are typically ingested by humans when they eat raw or undercooked meat that is infected with the tapeworm. The larvae then migrate through the body and can lodge in the skin, where they can cause a variety of symptoms, including a serpiginous erythematous plaque.

The patient in this case presented with a 4.0-cm linear plaque with an 8.0-mm erythematous nodule on one end on his right upper abdomen. The lesion appeared 2 months prior and had been mildly itchy. The patient lived in a farm community that used well water for drinking. He denied wading in local water sources and had not traveled abroad recently. The patient denied systemic symptoms, and further physical examination results were unremarkable. Recent laboratory blood work was notable for peripheral eosinophilia. A punch biopsy was performed, which revealed eosinophilic cuticle (external tegument) and calcareous bodies (basophilic internal structures). These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of cutaneous sparganosis.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms and findings. Gnathostomiasis is a parasitic infection caused by the larvae of the nematode Gnathostoma spinigerum. The larvae are typically ingested by humans when they eat raw or undercooked fish or meat that is infected with the nematode. The larvae then migrate through the body and can lodge in the skin, eyes, or other organs. Myiasis is a parasitic infection caused by the larvae of flies. The larvae typically enter the body through open wounds or through the skin when they are deposited by flies. Strongyloidiasis is a parasitic infection caused by the nematode Strongyloides stercoralis. The larvae are typically ingested by humans when they come into contact with contaminated soil or water. The larvae then migrate through the body and can lodge in the lungs, intestines, or other organs.

Explanation:
The patient is a 57-year-old woman with a history of sheep breeding and close contact with animals. She presents with a 1-day history of upper abdominal pain and anemia. The laboratory evaluation results reveal normocytic anemia, including a normal white blood cell count and a complete metabolic panel. An abdominal radiography is performed, which shows a rounded radio-opaque lesion in the right side of the mid to lower quadrant, at the level of L5 vertebral body. The lesion seems to contain a second smaller sclerotic lesion within its central part (a lesion-in-lesion appearance).

The most likely diagnosis is a calcified hydatid cyst. Hydatid cysts are caused by the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus. The tapeworm is found in dogs, cats, and other carnivores, and humans can become infected by ingesting eggs from the tapeworm. The eggs hatch in the small intestine and the larvae migrate to the liver, lungs, or other organs, where they form cysts.

Calcified hydatid cysts are the most common type of hydatid cyst. They are usually asymptomatic, but they can cause abdominal pain, anemia, and other symptoms. The diagnosis is made with imaging studies, such as abdominal radiography, ultrasound, or CT scan.

Treatment for calcified hydatid cysts is usually surgery. The cyst is removed and the area is drained. In some cases, medications may also be used.

The other options are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms or the findings on the abdominal radiography. Gallstones are small, hard deposits that form in the gallbladder. They can cause abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Gallstones are not typically associated with anemia.

A calcified bowel mass could be caused by a number of things, including a tumor, a polyp, or a hernia. However, the patient's history and physical examination do not suggest any of these conditions.

A swallowed foreign body is a rare cause of abdominal pain. It is more likely to occur in children than in adults. The foreign body can usually be passed on its own, but surgery may be necessary to remove it.

Explanation:

The most likely diagnosis is a congenital splenic cyst. This is supported by the following findings:

* The patient is a man in his mid-50s, which is the age group at which congenital splenic cysts are most commonly diagnosed.
* The cyst was discovered incidentally during a routine physical examination, which is typical of congenital splenic cysts.
* The cyst was large and well-defined, with mural calcification, which is characteristic of congenital splenic cysts.
* The laboratory test results were all within normal ranges, except for a mild increase in the carbohydrate antigen 72-4 level, which is a non-specific finding that can be seen with a variety of conditions, including congenital splenic cysts.
* During surgery, a huge hard mass, which was partially covered by fibrous and necrotic tissue, was found emerging from the lower pole of the spleen. This is consistent with the findings of a congenital splenic cyst, which is typically a solid mass with a cystic component.
* A gross pathologic examination revealed that the lower end of the spleen was occupied by a cyst, the surface of which was extremely dense and appeared to have an eggshell-like calcification. This is the classic appearance of a congenital splenic cyst.

Echinococcal disease is a parasitic infection that can cause cysts in the spleen. However, it is most commonly seen in people who live in or have traveled to areas where the disease is endemic, such as the Mediterranean region, the Middle East, and Central and South America. The patient in this case does not have any risk factors for echinococcal disease.

Secondary splenic cysts are cysts that develop as a result of infection, trauma, or surgery. The patient in this case has no history of infection, trauma, or surgery.

Splenic abscess is a collection of pus in the spleen. The patient in this case does not have any of the typical symptoms of a splenic abscess, such as fever, chills, and abdominal pain. Additionally, the laboratory test results were all within normal ranges, which is not consistent with a splenic abscess.

The patient's presentation is consistent with optic neuritis, which is an inflammation of the optic nerve. Optic neuritis can be caused by a number of conditions, including multiple sclerosis, autoimmune diseases, and infections. The most common initial test to diagnose optic neuritis is an MRI of the brain and orbits. This test can help to rule out other possible causes of the patient's vision loss, such as a brain tumor or stroke. If the MRI is normal, the patient may need to be tested for antiretinal antibodies, syphilis, and tuberculosis. These tests are used to rule out other possible causes of optic neuritis, such as multiple sclerosis and autoimmune diseases.

In this case, the patient's MRI showed bilateral optic nerve pallor and significantly attenuated retinal vessels. These findings are consistent with optic neuritis. The patient was also tested for antiretinal antibodies, syphilis, and tuberculosis. These tests were negative. The patient was diagnosed with optic neuritis and started on a course of corticosteroids. The patient's vision improved significantly over the next few weeks.

Here are the reasons why the other options are incorrect:

* Option B: Testing for antiretinal antibodies is not necessary in this case because the patient's MRI showed bilateral optic nerve pallor and significantly attenuated retinal vessels. These findings are consistent with optic neuritis.
* Option C: Syphilis and tuberculosis testing is not necessary in this case because the patient's MRI showed bilateral optic nerve pallor and significantly attenuated retinal vessels. These findings are consistent with optic neuritis.
* Option D: Obtaining erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) level is not necessary in this case because the patient's MRI showed bilateral optic nerve pallor and significantly attenuated retinal vessels. These findings are consistent with optic neuritis.

A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the orbit is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient. The MRI will help to determine the size, location, and extent of the tumor, as well as whether it has spread to other parts of the body. This information will be essential in planning the patient's treatment.

The other options are not as appropriate. Option B, referring to oncology for metastatic workups, is premature at this stage. The patient does not have any symptoms or signs of metastatic disease, and the MRI will help to determine whether this is a possibility. Option C, starting oral prednisone therapy, is also premature. Prednisone is a corticosteroid that can be used to treat inflammation, but it is not clear that the patient's tumor is inflammatory in nature. Option D, scheduling transscleral or transvitreal biopsy, is a more invasive procedure that should not be performed without further evaluation.

The patient should be referred to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation and management. The ophthalmologist will likely order an MRI of the orbit, as well as other tests as needed. The ophthalmologist will then discuss the patient's treatment options with her.

 74%|███████▎  | 1123/1525 [4:17:01<1:41:54, 15.21s/it]The correct answer is: C. Obtain a chorioretinal fine-needle aspiration biopsy sample of the lesion.

The patient has a white retinal hemorrhagic lesion with vitritis, and her history of immunosuppression, vitritis, and retinal whitening suggests a viral retinitis. However, the diagnosis is indeterminate, and treatment is recommended due to macular involvement. The patient has already been treated with a vitreous tap and intravitreous injection of foscarnet sodium and ganciclovir sodium, and she has begun valgancyclovir hydrochloride therapy. Sulfamethoxazole–trimethoprim sulfate was started to cover possible toxoplasmosis. Aqueous polymerase chain reaction testing was negative for cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, and toxoplasmosis. Systemic testing was negative for cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus, varicella zoster virus, Lyme disease, syphilis, Toxocara, toxoplasmosis, tuberculosis, and Bartonella. Rickettsia retinitis was also suspected clinically. Doxycycline hyclate was initiated, but subsequent titers were negative. The lesion continued to grow.

At this point, the patient's condition is not responding to treatment, and a definitive diagnosis is still needed. The next step should be to obtain a chorioretinal fine-needle aspiration biopsy sample of the lesion. This will allow for a histological diagnosis and identification of the causative organism. This information is essential for choosing the most effective treatment.

Broadening empirical antimicrobial coverage is not the best option at this time because the patient has already been treated with a variety of antimicrobials without success. Performing a vitrectomy with vitreous polymerase chain reaction is not the best option because the patient's aqueous polymerase chain reaction testing was already negative for the most common causes of viral retinitis. Referring the patient back to her oncologist is not the best option because the patient's oncologist is not likely to have any additional information or treatment options.

Therefore, the best course of action is to obtain a chorioretinal fine-needle aspiration biopsy sample of the lesion.

The patient in this case has a homogeneously enhancing, well-demarcated, ovoid mass within the medial intraconal space, measuring 2.0 × 2.2 × 2.6 cm. The lesion displaced the globe inferiorly and anteriorly. Smooth bony remodeling was present without erosive changes. Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits corroborated these findings. Conventional angiography demonstrated a tortuous branch of the left ophthalmic artery supplying the medial aspect of the orbital mass.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of cavernous hemangioma, a benign vascular tumor. Cavernous hemangiomas are the most common type of orbital tumor, accounting for approximately 15% of all orbital tumors. They are typically slow-growing and asymptomatic, but they can cause proptosis, diplopia, and visual loss.

The treatment of cavernous hemangiomas is controversial. Some experts recommend observation, while others recommend surgical excision or embolization. Embolization is a procedure in which a catheter is inserted into an artery and a substance is injected to block the flow of blood to the tumor. This can shrink the tumor and reduce symptoms.

In this case, I would recommend embolization followed by orbitotomy and biopsy. Embolization would shrink the tumor and make it easier to remove. Orbitotomy would allow me to biopsy the tumor to confirm the diagnosis and rule out any other possible causes of the patient's symptoms.

Fine-needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is not a good option in this case because it is not a reliable way to diagnose cavernous hemangiomas. FNAB can also cause bleeding and infection.

Fluorescein angiography is a test that can be used to diagnose and monitor certain eye diseases, but it is not a good option in this case. Fluorescein angiography is not a reliable way to diagnose cavernous hemangiomas.

Observation is not a good option in this case because the patient has symptoms that are likely caused by the tumor. Observation would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.

Explanation:
The most likely diagnosis is Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH), a rare disorder of the immune system that affects the skin, bones, and other organs. LCH is characterized by the proliferation of Langerhans cells, a type of white blood cell. The rash in LCH is typically red, scaly, and nummular (coin-shaped). It can occur anywhere on the body, but is most common on the scalp, face, trunk, and buttocks. The rash may be associated with other symptoms, such as fever, lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes), and hepatosplenomegaly (enlarged liver and spleen).

Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune disease that causes the rapid buildup of skin cells. This results in thick, red, scaly patches of skin. Psoriasis can affect any part of the body, but is most common on the elbows, knees, scalp, and lower back.

Congenital syphilis is a serious infection that can be transmitted from an infected mother to her unborn child. Symptoms of congenital syphilis can vary depending on the stage of the infection. In early-stage congenital syphilis, the infant may have a rash, fever, and swollen lymph nodes. In late-stage congenital syphilis, the infant may have bone and joint problems, hearing loss, and eye problems.

Pityriasis lichenoides is a chronic skin condition that causes small, scaly patches on the skin. The patches are typically round or oval and are often found on the trunk, arms, and legs. Pityriasis lichenoides is not contagious and is usually not serious.

The rash in the case presented is most consistent with LCH. The rash is red, scaly, and nummular, and it is located on the scalp, face, trunk, and buttocks. The patient also has lymphadenopathy, which is a common finding in LCH. Psoriasis, congenital syphilis, and pityriasis lichenoides are less likely diagnoses in this case.

Explanation:

The patient has a history of mantle chest radiotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma, which can cause radiation-induced constrictive pericarditis. Constrictive pericarditis is a condition in which the pericardium, the sac that surrounds the heart, becomes thickened and scarred. This can make it difficult for the heart to fill and empty, leading to symptoms such as dyspnea, lower extremity edema, and jugular venous distention.

In the case presented, the patient has a regular carotid pulsation and discernible internal jugular venous pulse. This is consistent with jugular venous distention, which is a sign of right ventricular failure. However, the patient also has a history of aortic valve replacement, which would make right ventricular failure less likely. Additionally, the patient's hemodynamic data shows that the left ventricular pressure is higher than the right atrial pressure. This is a sign of restrictive cardiomyopathy, which is a condition in which the heart muscle becomes stiff and cannot relax properly. Restrictive cardiomyopathy can be caused by a number of conditions, including radiation-induced constrictive pericarditis.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for the patient is radiation-induced constrictive pericarditis.

 74%|███████▍  | 1127/1525 [4:17:50<1:26:35, 13.05s/it]The correct answer is: C. Amyloidosis.

Pleomorphic adenomas are the most common type of parotid gland tumor, but they are not typically found in the parapharyngeal space. Paragangliomas are rare tumors that can arise from paraganglia, which are clusters of nerve cells that release hormones. Schwannomas are tumors that arise from Schwann cells, which are cells that support nerve cells. Amyloidosis is a condition in which abnormal proteins called amyloid accumulate in tissues and organs.

The patient in this case has a history of squamous cell carcinoma of the forehead, which is a type of cancer that can spread to the lymph nodes. The presence of a mass in the parapharyngeal space that is arising from the deep lobe of the parotid gland is suspicious for malignancy. The fact that the mass caused loss of the fat plane between the parapharyngeal space and masticator space with subsequent inflammation of the pterygoid space is also concerning for malignancy. The histopathological findings of confluent amorphous eosinophilic masses with surrounding foreign-body giant cell reaction and lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates, sheets of plasma cells that are positive for κ and CD138 and negative for λ, and Congo red stain that shows apple-green birefringence demonstrated on polarized microscopy are all consistent with a diagnosis of amyloidosis.

In conclusion, the correct answer is: C. Amyloidosis. The patient's history, physical examination, and imaging findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of amyloidosis. The histopathological findings are also consistent with a diagnosis of amyloidosis.

Explanation:

The patient is a man in his 70s with a history of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), diabetes, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. He presented with a 3-month history of hoarseness, throat pain, dysphagia, and odynophagia, which began after he was intubated for 13 days for neutropenic sepsis. Twenty-nine months prior to presentation, the patient had been diagnosed as having myelodysplastic syndrome, which 7 months later progressed to AML. During treatment for AML with low-dose cytarabine, his course was complicated by neutropenic sepsis requiring intubation, resulting in his head and neck symptoms.

His physical examination was notable for a “breathy” voice with no respiratory distress or cervical lymphadenopathy. Flexible nasal endoscopy revealed an immobile right vocal fold with broad submucosal fullness on the right false vocal cord and arytenoid. Computed tomography (CT) demonstrated a right-sided laryngeal mass extending from the level of the free margin of the epiglottis to the level of the glottis. In the operating room, during direct laryngoscopy a polypoid mass was seen based on the right arytenoid, also involving the right false vocal cord. Frozen section confirmed polypoid ulcerated tissue with granulation consistent with an inflammatory process, and histopathologic analysis demonstrated a mixed infiltrate containing numerous mononuclear myeloid cells positive for myeloperoxidase, CD34, CD68, and CD33 but negative for CD117. There are small numbers of scattered CD3+ T-cells and CD20+ B-cells.

The differential diagnosis for a laryngeal mass includes a variety of benign and malignant conditions. The most common benign lesions include polyps, papillomas, and vocal cord nodules. The most common malignant lesions include squamous cell carcinoma, lymphoma, and sarcoma.

In this case, the patient's history of AML and the histopathologic findings of a mixed infiltrate containing numerous mononuclear myeloid cells positive for myeloperoxidase, CD34, CD68, and CD33 but negative for CD117 are highly suggestive of myeloid sarcoma of the larynx. Myeloid sarcoma is a rare, aggressive neoplasm of myeloid cells that can occur in patients with a history of hematologic malignancy, such as AML. The most common presentation is a rapidly growing mass in the head and neck region. The diagnosis is made by biopsy, and the treatment is typically surgery followed by chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.

The other options are incorrect because they are not consistent with the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings. Laryngeal lymphoma is a rare neoplasm of B-lymphocytes that can occur in patients with a history of hematologic malignancy, such as lymphoma. However, the patient does not have a history of lymphoma, and the histopathologic findings are not consistent with a lymphoma. Extramedullary plasmacytoma is a rare neoplasm of plasma cells that can occur in patients with a history of myeloma. However, the patient does not have a history of myeloma, and the histopathologic findings are not consistent with a plasmacytoma. Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma is a common neoplasm of squamous cells that can occur in the larynx. However, the patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with a squamous cell carcinoma.

A Thornwaldt cyst is a rare, benign, developmental anomaly that occurs in the nasopharynx. It is thought to arise from a remnant of the notochord, which is a rod-shaped structure that forms the primitive backbone in the embryo. Thornwaldt cysts are typically found in children and young adults, and they are more common in males.

The most common symptom of a Thornwaldt cyst is chronic nasal obstruction. Other symptoms may include headache, facial pain, and postnasal drainage. In some cases, the cyst may rupture, causing sudden onset of severe headache and fever.

Diagnosis of a Thornwaldt cyst is usually made with a CT scan or MRI. Treatment is typically not necessary unless the cyst is causing symptoms. In these cases, the cyst may be drained or removed surgically.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a malignant tumor that arises from the nasopharynx. It is the most common type of cancer of the nasopharynx, and it is more common in men than women. The most common symptoms of nasopharyngeal carcinoma are nasal obstruction, epistaxis (nosebleed), and hearing loss. Diagnosis is usually made with a biopsy. Treatment usually involves a combination of radiation therapy and chemotherapy.
* Extraosseous chordoma is a rare, malignant tumor that arises from the notochord. It can occur anywhere in the body, but it is most common in the sacrum (the lower part of the spine). The most common symptoms of extraosseous chordoma are pain, swelling, and a mass. Diagnosis is usually made with a biopsy. Treatment usually involves surgery and radiation therapy.
* Meningocele is a protrusion of the meninges (the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord) through a defect in the skull or spine. It is a congenital defect, meaning that it is present at birth. The most common symptoms of a meningocele are a mass on the head or back, pain, and neurological problems. Diagnosis is usually made with a CT scan or MRI. Treatment usually involves surgery to repair the defect.

Microscopic urinalysis is a good initial test to confirm the presence of blood in the urine, but it does not provide information about the source of the bleeding. A cystoscopy is a procedure in which a doctor inserts a small camera into the bladder to look for any abnormalities. This is the most accurate way to diagnose the cause of hematuria.

A computed tomographic scan (CT scan) can be used to look for structural abnormalities in the kidneys, bladder, or prostate. However, it is not as accurate as cystoscopy for diagnosing the cause of hematuria.

Urine cytology is a test that looks for cancer cells in the urine. However, it is not a very sensitive test, so it is not usually used to diagnose the cause of hematuria.

Therefore, the best next step in this case is to refer the patient to a urologist for cystoscopy.

Explanation:

Incontinentia pigmenti (IP) is a rare, X-linked dominant genetic disorder characterized by a distinctive skin rash, developmental delays, and other abnormalities. The skin rash is usually the first sign of IP, and it typically appears within the first few weeks of life. The rash is characterized by linear, Blaschkolinear streaks of purplish-brown or black pigmentation. The rash usually fades over time, but it may leave behind areas of hypopigmentation (lighter skin) or hyperpigmentation (darker skin).

IP can also cause developmental delays, including intellectual disability, seizures, and hearing loss. Other possible abnormalities include eye problems, heart defects, and skeletal abnormalities.

There is no cure for IP, but treatment can help to manage the symptoms. Treatment may include medications to control seizures, hearing aids, and surgery to correct heart defects or skeletal abnormalities.

The patient in the case presented with irregular, dark brown, well-demarcated macules within prominent soft, yellow, papular protrusions in a Blaschkolinear arrangement on her upper arms, particularly her right arm. The right flank demonstrated linear, atrophic pink plaques with focal erosions and crusting, evidencing recent inflammation described by the patient’s mother. These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of IP.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Epidermolysis bullosa with mottled pigmentation is a rare, genetic disorder that causes the skin to blister easily. The blisters are usually caused by minor trauma, such as rubbing or scratching. Epidermolysis bullosa with mottled pigmentation does not cause the linear, Blaschkolinear streaks of purplish-brown or black pigmentation that are characteristic of IP.
* Focal dermal hypoplasia (Goltz syndrome) is a rare, genetic disorder that causes skin abnormalities, skeletal abnormalities, and other problems. The skin abnormalities in Goltz syndrome include hypopigmentation (lighter skin), hyperpigmentation (darker skin), and atrophic (thin) skin. Goltz syndrome does not cause the linear, Blaschkolinear streaks of purplish-brown or black pigmentation that are characteristic of IP.
* Nevus lipomatosus superficialis is a rare, benign (noncancerous) skin condition that causes small, fatty tumors to develop in the skin. Nevus lipomatosus superficialis does not cause the linear, Blaschkolinear streaks of purplish-brown or black pigmentation that are characteristic of IP.

 74%|███████▍  | 1133/1525 [4:19:18<1:27:37, 13.41s/it]Answer: C. Incontinentia pigmenti

Explanation:

Incontinentia pigmenti (IP) is a rare, X-linked dominant disorder characterized by a variety of skin lesions, including linear vesicles, hyperpigmentation, and hypopigmentation. It is caused by a mutation in the NEMO gene, which is involved in the regulation of the immune system.

The lesions typically begin within the first few weeks of life and follow a characteristic pattern of development. The first stage is characterized by linear vesicles, which often form whorls and swirls. The vesicles typically resolve within a few weeks, leaving behind hyperpigmented macules. The hyperpigmentation can persist for years or even decades.

Other features of IP can include alopecia, nail dystrophy, dental abnormalities, and seizures. The severity of IP can vary greatly from person to person. Some people have only mild skin lesions, while others have more severe manifestations, including seizures and developmental delays.

There is no cure for IP, but there are treatments that can help to manage the symptoms. Treatment may include topical steroids, oral antibiotics, and anticonvulsants.

In the case of the newborn girl described in the question, the linear vesicles and hyperpigmented macules are consistent with the diagnosis of IP. The negative results of the herpes simplex and varicella zoster virus polymerase chain reactions, syphilis, cytomegalovirus, and toxoplasma serologies, and bacterial and fungal cultures of the vesicles further support the diagnosis of IP.

The other possible diagnoses are not consistent with the clinical presentation of the patient. Congenital herpes zoster is characterized by vesicular lesions that follow a dermatomal distribution. Neonatal pustular melanosis is characterized by pustules that resolve within a few days, leaving behind hyperpigmented macules. Linear and whorled nevoid hypermelanosis is characterized by linear streaks of hyperpigmentation that are not associated with vesicles.

 74%|███████▍  | 1134/1525 [4:19:29<1:21:54, 12.57s/it]The correct answer is B: Eruptive xanthomas.

Eruptive xanthomas are a type of xanthoma that presents as multiple, small, yellow papules or nodules. They are most commonly seen on the buttocks, elbows, and knees, but can also occur in the axillae. They are caused by an accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages in the skin.

The patient in this case presents with multiple, small, yellow papules in the axillae. He also has a history of hypertension, which is a risk factor for eruptive xanthomas. The physical examination findings are consistent with eruptive xanthomas, and the histopathological analysis of the biopsy specimen shows histiocytes with foam cells, scattered lymphocytes, and few plasma cells. These findings are also consistent with eruptive xanthomas.

Acanthosis nigricans is a skin disorder that is characterized by thickened, dark skin in the folds of the skin, such as the armpits, groin, and neck. It is caused by an overgrowth of the cells in the epidermis, the outer layer of the skin. Acanthosis nigricans is not a xanthoma, and it is not caused by an accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages in the skin.

Xanthoma disseminatum is a rare, systemic disease that is characterized by the widespread appearance of xanthomas. The xanthomas can occur on any part of the body, but they are most commonly seen on the palms, soles, and eyelids. Xanthoma disseminatum is caused by an abnormal accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages in the skin.

Axillary granular parakeratosis is a benign skin condition that is characterized by the accumulation of granular cells in the stratum corneum, the outermost layer of the epidermis. Axillary granular parakeratosis is not a xanthoma, and it is not caused by an accumulation of lipid-laden macrophages in the skin.

The patient described a strong unilateral headache located in her left cheek, eye, and forehead that evolved during the evening hours, peaked at night, and decreased again until the morning, without any remarkable trigger. This first episode went along with ipsilateral lacrimation, a red eye, and periorbital swelling but without ptosis. These are all classic symptoms of cluster headache.

Cluster headache is a rare type of headache that is characterized by severe, one-sided pain that often occurs in the same spot around the eye. The pain is typically described as a burning or piercing sensation, and it can be accompanied by other symptoms such as tearing, redness of the eye, and nasal congestion. Cluster headaches tend to occur in clusters, with periods of frequent attacks followed by periods of remission.

Tolosa-Hunt syndrome is a rare condition that causes inflammation of the nerves that control eye movement. It can cause pain around the eye, as well as other symptoms such as double vision, drooping eyelid, and redness of the eye. However, Tolosa-Hunt syndrome does not typically cause the other symptoms that the patient described, such as lacrimation and periorbital swelling.

A space-occupying mucocele of the nasopharynx is a rare type of tumor that can grow in the back of the nose. It can cause symptoms such as nasal congestion, facial pain, and headache. However, it is unlikely that this would cause the patient's symptoms, as it is not typically associated with lacrimation and periorbital swelling.

An acute episode of angle-closure glaucoma is a serious eye condition that can cause sudden blindness. It is caused by a blockage of the drainage system in the eye, which can lead to a build-up of pressure inside the eye. Symptoms of angle-closure glaucoma include severe eye pain, blurred vision, and halos around lights. However, the patient did not report any of these symptoms, so it is unlikely that she has angle-closure glaucoma.

In conclusion, the patient's symptoms are most consistent with a diagnosis of cluster headache.

Explanation:

The patient is a woman in her 40s with diabetes who presents with pain in the right groin that has worsened since its onset 3 days before. The pain radiated throughout the right leg and was related to nausea without vomiting. The patient’s history revealed chronic constipation, relieved by the use of laxatives. The patient never noticed any inguinal protrusion or mass. Furthermore, results of an abdominal physical examination were also normal, and no neurological or vascular deficits were found.

The abdominal computed tomographic scans performed in the emergency department show a thickened sigmoid colon with evidence of diverticulosis. There is no evidence of an inguinal hernia or any other abdominal abnormality.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is diabetic neuropathy. Diabetic neuropathy is a common complication of diabetes that can affect the nerves throughout the body, including the nerves in the groin. The symptoms of diabetic neuropathy can vary depending on the nerves that are affected, but can include pain, numbness, tingling, and weakness.

The patient's history of diabetes, the location of the pain, and the lack of other findings on physical examination and imaging are all consistent with a diagnosis of diabetic neuropathy. Treatment for diabetic neuropathy is aimed at managing the pain and preventing further damage to the nerves. This may include medication, physical therapy, and lifestyle changes such as controlling blood sugar levels and quitting smoking.

A right inguinal hernia is a condition in which a part of the intestine pushes through a weak spot in the abdominal wall near the groin. This can cause pain, swelling, and a lump in the groin area. The patient in this case does not have any of the typical symptoms of a right inguinal hernia, such as a lump in the groin or pain that is worse when coughing or straining. Therefore, a right inguinal hernia is not the most likely diagnosis in this case.

A bilateral femoral hernia is a condition in which a part of the intestine pushes through a weak spot in the abdominal wall near the groin on both sides. This can cause pain, swelling, and a lump in the groin area. The patient in this case does not have any of the typical symptoms of a bilateral femoral hernia, such as a lump in the groin or pain that is worse when coughing or straining. Therefore, a bilateral femoral hernia is not the most likely diagnosis in this case.

Vascular occlusive disease is a condition in which the blood vessels that supply blood to the legs become narrowed or blocked. This can cause pain, numbness, and weakness in the legs. The patient in this case does not have any of the typical symptoms of vascular occlusive disease, such as pain in the legs that is worse when walking. Therefore, vascular occlusive disease is not the most likely diagnosis in this case.

Explanation:

The patient is a 72-year-old woman with a 6-month history of a dull, epigastric pain, 10-kg weight loss (from 52 kg to 42 kg), and a 6- to 8-week history of nausea and vomiting. Physical examination showed no notable abnormalities. Blood test results revealed anemia (hemoglobin 9.8 g/dL [to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10]) but were otherwise unremarkable. Upper gastrointestinal series showed subtotal occlusion in the second part of the duodenum (Figure 1 A). Computed tomography of the abdomen confirmed intraluminal narrowing of the duodenum without signs of a mass (Figure 1 B, arrowhead). Gastroduodenoscopy revealed a duodenal ulcer with pinpoint stenosis that could not be passed or dilated. Multiple biopsies were negative for cancer. Total parenteral nutrition was started and the patient was scheduled for surgery.

The most likely diagnosis is fibrosis owing to chronic peptic ulceration. This is supported by the patient's history of epigastric pain, weight loss, and nausea and vomiting. The upper gastrointestinal series and computed tomography scan showed subtotal occlusion of the duodenum, which is consistent with a duodenal ulcer. The gastroduodenoscopy revealed a duodenal ulcer with pinpoint stenosis, which is also consistent with chronic peptic ulceration. The multiple biopsies were negative for cancer, which makes duodenal carcinoma less likely.

Duodenal web and annular pancreas are rare causes of gastric outlet obstruction. Duodenal web is a thin, web-like membrane that can form across the lumen of the duodenum. Annular pancreas is a congenital anomaly in which a ring of pancreatic tissue encircles the duodenum. Both duodenal web and annular pancreas can cause gastric outlet obstruction, but they are less likely than chronic peptic ulceration in this patient.

Explanation:

The patient in this case presents with a typical clinical picture of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), a common type of skin cancer. The diagnosis is supported by the histopathologic findings, which show a necrotic epithelium with multinucleated keratinocytes and cytoplasmic inclusions.

BCC is a locally invasive tumor that can spread to regional lymph nodes and distant sites. The treatment of choice for BCC is surgical excision with clear margins. Mohs micrographic surgery is a specialized technique that allows for the precise removal of BCC with minimal tissue loss. This technique is particularly well-suited for tumors in cosmetically sensitive areas such as the eyelid.

After Mohs micrographic surgery, the defect is typically reconstructed with a local flap or skin graft. This helps to restore the normal appearance and function of the eyelid.

The other options are not appropriate treatments for BCC. Wide local excision with map biopsies is a less precise technique that is associated with a higher risk of local recurrence. Cryotherapy is a destructive treatment that can damage healthy tissue. Oral valacyclovir is an antiviral medication that is used to treat herpes simplex virus infection. It is not effective against BCC.

Explanation:

The patient has herpes zoster ophthalmicus, which is a herpes zoster infection of the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. The most common ocular manifestation of herpes zoster ophthalmicus is dendritic keratitis, which is a branch-like pattern of corneal epithelial ulceration. Dendritic keratitis is treated with topical trifluridine, a antiviral medication. Oral acyclovir is also effective in treating herpes zoster ophthalmicus, but it is not as effective as topical trifluridine for treating dendritic keratitis. In addition, oral acyclovir can cause side effects such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Therefore, the best course of treatment for this patient is to discontinue oral acyclovir and start topical trifluridine.

A corneal culture is not necessary in this case because the diagnosis of herpes zoster ophthalmicus is clinical. Human immunodeficiency virus testing and lymphocyte analysis are not necessary in this case because there is no evidence of human immunodeficiency virus infection. Corneal topography is not necessary in this case because the patient does not have any evidence of corneal scarring.

Explanation:
The patient has a history of CMV retinitis in the contralateral eye, and the findings of hemorrhagic retinitis adjacent to chorioretinal scars suggestive of prior, healed CMV retinitis. However, the lesions have progressed despite treatment with oral valganciclovir. In addition, there is mild vitritis and new areas of retinitis along the inferior arcade. These findings are concerning for a new infection, such as toxoplasmosis or herpes simplex virus retinitis. To confirm the diagnosis, it is important to obtain aqueous and vitreous samples for polymerase chain reaction/culture/cytology. This will allow identification of the causative organism and guide further treatment.

The other options are not as appropriate in this case. Adding steroids would not be helpful in the setting of a new infection. Checking serology results for exposure to infectious agents would not be helpful in the setting of a new infection, as the patient has already been exposed to CMV. Injecting intravitreous voriconazole is a treatment option for CMV retinitis, but it is not appropriate in this case as the patient has already been treated with oral valganciclovir.

The patient has a well-defined superotemporal mass with homogeneous enhancement on MRI, which is concerning for a neoplasm. The patient's pain has nearly resolved after 3 days of intravenous methylprednisolone treatment, but pain on palpation of the superotemporal left orbit persists. These findings suggest that the patient may have a neoplasm that is responsive to steroids but not completely resolved. Incision biopsy is the most definitive way to diagnose the nature of the lesion and to determine the appropriate treatment.

A gallium scan is a nuclear medicine imaging test that is used to detect inflammation. It is not specific for neoplasms and would not be helpful in this case. Antiviral therapy with acyclovir is used to treat viral infections, such as herpes zoster. The patient's clinical presentation does not suggest a viral infection, and antiviral therapy would not be appropriate in this case. Increasing the dosage of oral prednisone may help to reduce the patient's pain, but it would not provide a definitive diagnosis or treatment for the underlying neoplasm.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to perform incisional biopsy of the left lacrimal gland.

Explanation:

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with black-spot poison ivy dermatitis. The rash typically starts as small red bumps that develop into blisters. The blisters then rupture and leave black spots on the skin. The rash is often itchy and can be painful.

Coxsackievirus A6–associated exanthem is a viral infection that can cause a rash. The rash is usually characterized by small, red spots that appear on the trunk and extremities. The rash is often not itchy and does not leave any scars.

Phototoxic dermatitis (phytophoto) is a type of skin rash that is caused by a reaction to sunlight and certain chemicals. The rash is often characterized by red, swollen skin that is painful and itchy. The rash can appear anywhere on the body that is exposed to sunlight.

Nickel contact dermatitis is a type of skin rash that is caused by an allergic reaction to nickel. The rash is often characterized by red, itchy bumps that appear on the skin that has come into contact with nickel. The rash can appear anywhere on the body, but it is most common on the hands, wrists, and neck.

The patient's rash is most consistent with black-spot poison ivy dermatitis. The rash is located on the arms, neck, and axillae, which are areas of the body that are commonly exposed to poison ivy. The rash is also characterized by black spots, which are a classic finding in black-spot poison ivy dermatitis. The patient's history of atopic dermatitis is not a significant factor in the diagnosis, as atopic dermatitis does not increase the risk of developing black-spot poison ivy dermatitis. The patient's treatment with diphenhydramine, cetirizine, and a 20-mg dose of prednisone has not been effective in treating the rash, which is consistent with a diagnosis of black-spot poison ivy dermatitis. The patient's family history is not significant in the diagnosis, as black-spot poison ivy dermatitis is not a hereditary condition.

 75%|███████▍  | 1143/1525 [4:21:20<1:20:01, 12.57s/it]The correct answer is D. FFR with adenosine should be remeasured after placing a stent in the distal lesion to better assess the proximal lesion.

The nadir FFR value of 0.43 across both lesions suggests that both lesions are ischemic. However, the proximal lesion has an FFR value of 0.82, which is above the threshold of 0.75 that is considered to be ischemic. This suggests that the proximal lesion may not be causing ischemia, and that the distal lesion may be the only one that needs to be stented. However, it is important to remeasure the FFR after placing a stent in the distal lesion to confirm that the proximal lesion is not causing ischemia. This is because the FFR can be falsely elevated in the presence of a proximal lesion, and the distal lesion may be shunting blood around the proximal lesion.

Answer A is incorrect because the distal lesion is also ischemic. Answer B is incorrect because the proximal lesion may also be ischemic. Answer C is incorrect because it is not possible to say for sure that both lesions are ischemic without re-measuring the FFR after stenting the distal lesion.

 75%|███████▌  | 1144/1525 [4:21:30<1:14:43, 11.77s/it]Answer: C. Osteosarcoma

Explanation:
The patient's history of bilateral retinoblastoma and advanced malignant small blue cell tumor, which was interpreted as an olfactory neuroblastoma and treated with radiation and chemotherapy, is significant. These tumors are both associated with a high risk of developing secondary malignancies, including osteosarcoma. The patient's presentation with a hard, fixed, rounded 2-cm lesion in the right supraorbital region is also consistent with osteosarcoma. The CT scan showed an irregular mass in the right frontal, maxillary, and ethmoid sinuses with surrounding sclerotic and erosive bony changes. This is also consistent with osteosarcoma. The FNA revealed atypical, mitotically active cells. This is a non-specific finding, but it is consistent with osteosarcoma. The bone shavings obtained operatively were interpreted as chronic sinusitis with sclerotic bone. This is a non-specific finding, but it is possible that the bone changes were due to the patient's previous treatment for retinoblastoma and olfactory neuroblastoma. The surgical specimen showed multinucleated giant cells and bizarre stromal cells suggestive of treatment effect. This is a non-specific finding, but it is possible that the giant cells and bizarre stromal cells were due to the patient's previous treatment for retinoblastoma and olfactory neuroblastoma. A second opinion was reported as chronic sinusitis and atypical stromal cells. This is a non-specific finding, but it is possible that the atypical stromal cells were due to the patient's previous treatment for retinoblastoma and olfactory neuroblastoma. When the patient returned 2 months later with increasing pain, endoscopy revealed a polypoid lesion occupying the biopsied site. On repeated operative biopsy, histologic examination showed similar giant cells and atypical stromal cells. However, other areas demonstrated osteoid formation with fine calcifications and severely atypical spindle cells with mitotic figures. This is a classic presentation of osteosarcoma. The osteoid formation and calcifications are evidence of bone production, which is a characteristic feature of osteosarcoma. The severely atypical spindle cells with mitotic figures are evidence of malignancy. Based on the patient's history, presentation, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is osteosarcoma.

 75%|███████▌  | 1145/1525 [4:21:46<1:22:09, 12.97s/it]The answer is **C**. Cavernous hemangioma.

A cavernous hemangioma is a benign tumor of blood vessels that can occur anywhere in the body. It is made up of large, empty spaces filled with blood. Cavernous hemangiomas are usually not harmful, but they can cause problems if they grow large enough to press on surrounding structures.

The patient in this case has a history of stroke-like symptoms, which could be caused by a mass pressing on the blood vessels in the brain. The CT scan shows an expansile anterior nasal septum mass measuring 1.9 × 2.4 cm with internal matrix mineralization. This is consistent with a cavernous hemangioma, which is a type of tumor that can cause bone expansion.

The biopsy of the mass showed that it was composed of blood vessels lined by endothelial cells. This is also consistent with a diagnosis of cavernous hemangioma.

The treatment for cavernous hemangiomas is usually surgery to remove the tumor. In some cases, radiation therapy may also be used.

The other possible diagnoses are all malignant tumors. Chondroma is a benign tumor of cartilage, chondroblastoma is a benign tumor of bone and cartilage, and low-grade chondrosarcoma is a low-grade malignant tumor of cartilage. All of these tumors are less likely to cause the symptoms that the patient is experiencing than a cavernous hemangioma.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for the patient in this case is cavernous hemangioma. This is a benign tumor of blood vessels that can cause bone expansion. The treatment for cavernous hemangiomas is usually surgery to remove the tumor.

Chordoma is a rare, slow-growing tumor that arises from remnants of the notochord. It is most commonly found in the sacrum, but it can also occur in the skull base, clivus, and spine. Chordomas are locally invasive tumors that can spread to distant sites, such as the lungs and liver.

The patient in the case presented with a recurrent, slow-growing retropharyngeal mass. The mass was heterogeneously hyperenhancing on T1-weighting and centered at the atlantoaxial joint, causing erosion of the upper dens, anterior arch of C1, and the basion. These findings are consistent with a chordoma.

Hemangiomas and vascular hamartomas are benign tumors that are composed of blood vessels. They are typically not associated with erosion of bone. Meningiomas are benign tumors that arise from the meninges, the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. They are typically not associated with erosion of bone.

In conclusion, the patient in the case presented with a recurrent, slow-growing retropharyngeal mass that is consistent with a chordoma.

Explanation:
The patient is a woman in her 60s who was evaluated in the neurosurgery intensive care unit for purulent discharge from her right ear. She had undergone an emergency craniotomy for brain decompression the day before. She was receiving intravenous antibiotics and steroids and was sedated and mechanically ventilated. Computed tomography (CT) of the temporal bone detected middle ear, mastoid, and infralabyrinthine involvement (Figure, A). Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain demonstrated meningitis and a large cerebellar lesion with rim enhancement. Moreover, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) images and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were consistent with cerebellar abscess (Figure, B-D).

The most likely diagnosis is a cerebellar abscess. This is supported by the patient's history of purulent ear drainage, which is a common presenting symptom of cerebellar abscess. The CT scan showed evidence of middle ear, mastoid, and infralabyrinthine involvement, which are all common findings in cerebellar abscess. The MRI showed a large cerebellar lesion with rim enhancement, which is also a common finding in cerebellar abscess. The DWI images and ADC maps were consistent with cerebellar abscess, which is a highly specific finding for this condition.

Complicated acute otitis media is a less likely diagnosis. This is because the patient does not have any of the typical symptoms of complicated acute otitis media, such as fever, ear pain, and hearing loss. In addition, the CT scan did not show any evidence of mastoiditis, which is a common finding in complicated acute otitis media.

Aggressive cholesteatoma is also a less likely diagnosis. This is because the patient does not have any of the typical symptoms of aggressive cholesteatoma, such as hearing loss, tinnitus, and facial nerve palsy. In addition, the CT scan did not show any evidence of bone destruction, which is a common finding in aggressive cholesteatoma.

Endolymphatic sac tumor is a very unlikely diagnosis. This is because the patient does not have any of the typical symptoms of endolymphatic sac tumor, such as hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo. In addition, the CT scan did not show any evidence of erosion of the petrous bone, which is a common finding in endolymphatic sac tumor.

 75%|███████▌  | 1148/1525 [4:22:26<1:20:21, 12.79s/it]The answer is **A: Cholesterol granuloma**.

Cholesterol granuloma is a benign, expansile lesion that is thought to arise from an inflammatory reaction to cholesterol crystals. It is most commonly found in the petrous apex, but can also occur in other bones, such as the skull, mandible, and ribs.

The typical presentation of cholesterol granuloma is with a slowly progressive headache, facial pain, and hearing loss. The lesion may also cause facial paralysis, trigeminal nerve dysfunction, and vestibular symptoms.

On imaging, cholesterol granulomas are typically well-circumscribed, expansile lesions with a mixed density on CT scan and a heterogeneous appearance on MRI. They may contain a fluid-fluid level, which is characteristic of cholesterol granuloma.

The treatment for cholesterol granuloma is surgical excision. This usually results in complete resolution of symptoms.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Aneurysmal bone cyst is a benign, expansile lesion that is thought to arise from a vascular malformation. It is most commonly found in the long bones, but can also occur in other bones, such as the skull and mandible. The typical presentation of aneurysmal bone cyst is with a painful, expansile lesion. On imaging, aneurysmal bone cysts are typically well-circumscribed, expansile lesions with a honeycomb appearance. The treatment for aneurysmal bone cyst is surgical excision or curettage and bone grafting.
* Endolymphatic sac tumor is a rare, benign tumor that arises from the endolymphatic sac, which is a structure in the inner ear. It is most commonly found in adults, but can also occur in children. The typical presentation of endolymphatic sac tumor is with hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo. On imaging, endolymphatic sac tumors are typically well-circumscribed, expansile lesions that involve the inner ear. The treatment for endolymphatic sac tumor is surgical excision.
* Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare, non-cancerous disorder that affects the Langerhans cells, which are a type of white blood cell. It can occur in any part of the body, but is most commonly found in the bones, skin, and lymph nodes. The typical presentation of Langerhans cell histiocytosis is with a skin rash, bone pain, and lymphadenopathy. On imaging, Langerhans cell histiocytosis can have a variety of appearances, depending on the organ system involved. The treatment for Langerhans cell histiocytosis is with chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

Explanation:

The patient is a white woman in her 60s with a medical history of multiple joint replacements related to osteoarthritis. She presented with left leg pain that had progressively worsened over 3 months. She also noted night sweats 2 weeks prior to presentation but denied any other associated symptoms.

On physical examination, the patient had limited range of motion of the left leg related to pain. There was no cervical, axillary, or inguinal lymphadenopathy.

Laboratory evaluation demonstrated a hemoglobin level of 10.3 g/dL and a lactic acid dehydrogenase level of 599 u/L. Serum protein electrophoresis testing did not detect a monoclonal protein.

A plain radiograph of the left femur showed a 15-cm area of moderate destruction in the proximal femoral shaft extending distally from the level of the lesser trochanter with concern for impending fracture. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis did not visualize any metastatic disease, and results were negative for lymph node enlargement. A nuclear medicine bone scan demonstrated increased uptake in the left femur with no other focal abnormalities. The patient underwent a CT-guided needle biopsy of the left femur.

The biopsy specimen showed a proliferation of plasma cells. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for CD138 and negative for CD3, CD20, and CD56. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of solitary plasmacytoma of bone.

Solitary plasmacytoma of bone is a rare, non-Hodgkin lymphoma that arises from a single plasma cell clone. It is typically seen in patients in their 60s or 70s, and is more common in men than women. The most common presentation is with bone pain, which is often localized to the axial skeleton. Other symptoms may include fever, night sweats, and weight loss.

The diagnosis of solitary plasmacytoma of bone is made based on clinical findings, laboratory results, and imaging studies. A bone biopsy is usually required to confirm the diagnosis.

The treatment of solitary plasmacytoma of bone typically involves radiation therapy to the affected bone. In some cases, chemotherapy may also be used. The prognosis for patients with solitary plasmacytoma of bone is generally good, with a 5-year survival rate of over 80%.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not fit the clinical presentation of the patient. Fibrosarcoma is a malignant tumor of mesenchymal origin that typically occurs in children or young adults. Solitary plasmacytoma of bone is a non-Hodgkin lymphoma that typically occurs in older adults. Primary lymphoma of bone is a rare, aggressive lymphoma that typically occurs in children. Fibrous dysplasia is a non-neoplastic bone disorder that is characterized by the replacement of normal bone with fibrous tissue.

The patient has a history of metastatic mucinous appendiceal adenocarcinoma, which is a type of cancer that can spread to the skin. The rash is accompanied by diffuse alopecia, which is a loss of hair. These findings are concerning for a paraneoplastic syndrome, which is a condition that occurs when a tumor produces a substance that affects another part of the body. Paraneoplastic syndromes can cause a variety of symptoms, including rash, alopecia, and other skin problems.

To diagnose a paraneoplastic syndrome, a doctor will order a paraneoplastic panel, which is a group of tests that look for certain substances in the blood that are associated with cancer. If the paraneoplastic panel is positive, it will help the doctor to determine the type of cancer that is causing the syndrome.

The other options are not correct because they would not be the first step in diagnosing a paraneoplastic syndrome. A skin biopsy is a procedure in which a small piece of skin is removed and examined under a microscope. This procedure would be used to diagnose a skin condition, such as eczema or psoriasis. Obtaining trace element levels would be used to check for a deficiency in certain minerals, such as zinc or copper. This would not be the first step in diagnosing a paraneoplastic syndrome.

Explanation:

The patient's hemoglobin level is elevated, but her erythropoietin level is low-normal. This suggests that the elevated hemoglobin level is not due to a primary cause such as polycythemia vera, but rather to a secondary cause such as dehydration. Dehydration can cause an increase in the concentration of red blood cells in the blood, as the body attempts to compensate for the loss of fluids. Further testing would likely indicate a normal red blood cell mass with a low plasma volume, which would support the diagnosis of dehydration.

Answer A is incorrect because the patient's erythropoietin level is low-normal, which is not consistent with a diagnosis of polycythemia vera.

Answer B is incorrect because the patient's history and physical examination are not suggestive of a familial cause of polycythemia.

Explanation:

The patient is a Japanese man in his 80s with a 3-year history of erythematous papules on the bilateral cheeks without any additional symptoms. The lesions had repeatedly recurred despite topical steroid therapy. The patient was otherwise healthy. Physical examination revealed papules and plaques ranging up to 1 cm in diameter on the lateral cheeks and behind the ears and neck along with a red-brown hue. Complete blood cell count and comprehensive metabolic panel results were unremarkable. However, serum protein electrophoresis revealed polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia. Antinuclear antibody and anti-Ro/SS-A and anti-La/SS-B antibodies were undetectable by indirect immunofluorescence or double immunodiffusion methods. Computed tomography (CT) revealed bilateral parotid gland swelling together with mild lymphadenopathy in the mediastinum and hilus. A skin biopsy specimen was obtained from a papule on the neck for further analysis.

The differential diagnosis for this patient includes sarcoidosis, IgG4-related skin disease, cutaneous lymphoma, and Sjögren syndrome. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease that can affect any organ system, including the skin. The skin lesions of sarcoidosis are typically non-specific and can be papular, nodular, or plaque-like. Cutaneous lymphoma is a type of cancer that starts in the skin. The skin lesions of cutaneous lymphoma can be varied in appearance, but they are often asymmetrical and violaceous. Sjögren syndrome is an autoimmune disease that affects the glands that produce tears and saliva. The skin lesions of Sjögren syndrome can be erythematous papules or plaques, but they are often associated with other features of the disease, such as dry eyes and mouth.

In this patient, the most likely diagnosis is IgG4-related skin disease. IgG4-related skin disease is a recently described autoimmune disease that is characterized by the infiltration of skin lesions with IgG4-positive plasma cells. The skin lesions of IgG4-related skin disease can be varied in appearance, but they are often papular, nodular, or plaque-like. The patient in this case has several features that are consistent with a diagnosis of IgG4-related skin disease, including the presence of papules and plaques on the cheeks, bilateral parotid gland swelling, and mild lymphadenopathy. In addition, the skin biopsy specimen showed a nodular inflammatory cell infiltration consisting of dense lymphocytes admixed with plasma cells and eosinophils, which is a characteristic finding of IgG4-related skin disease.

The other possible diagnoses in this patient are less likely. Sarcoidosis is less likely because the patient does not have any other features of the disease, such as lung nodules or hilar lymphadenopathy. Cutaneous lymphoma is less likely because the patient's skin lesions are symmetrical and violaceous, which are not typical features of cutaneous lymphoma. Sjögren syndrome is less likely because the patient does not have any other features of the disease, such as dry eyes and mouth.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this patient is IgG4-related skin disease.

Leukemia cutis is a skin manifestation of leukemia, characterized by the presence of leukemic cells in the skin. The most common type of leukemia cutis is acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is the type of leukemia that the patient in the case presentation has.

Leukemia cutis can present with a variety of skin lesions, including papules, plaques, nodules, and tumors. The lesions can be red, purple, or brown, and they may be tender or painful. In some cases, the lesions may bleed or ulcerate.

The diagnosis of leukemia cutis is made based on a skin biopsy, which shows the presence of leukemic cells in the skin. The treatment of leukemia cutis depends on the type of leukemia, the stage of the disease, and the extent of the skin involvement. Treatment may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and/or bone marrow transplantation.

Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a serious disorder in which the blood's clotting system is activated throughout the body. This can lead to the formation of small blood clots in the blood vessels, which can block the flow of blood and damage organs and tissues. DIC can be caused by a variety of conditions, including infection, cancer, and trauma.

Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is a type of vasculitis that is characterized by inflammation of small blood vessels. It can cause a variety of skin lesions, including purpura (purple spots), papules (small bumps), and vesicles (blisters). Leukocytoclastic vasculitis can be caused by a variety of conditions, including infections, drugs, and autoimmune diseases.

Cutaneous mucormycosis is a rare fungal infection of the skin. It is most commonly seen in people with weakened immune systems, such as those with cancer or diabetes. Cutaneous mucormycosis can cause a variety of skin lesions, including ulcers, nodules, and tumors. It can also spread to other organs, such as the lungs and brain.

In the case presentation, the patient has a history of AML and is currently experiencing blast crisis. This means that the leukemia has progressed to a point where the leukemic cells are rapidly dividing and producing large numbers of abnormal cells. These abnormal cells can then spread to other parts of the body, including the skin. The skin lesions that the patient is experiencing are consistent with leukemia cutis.

The other options are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation as well as leukemia cutis does. Disseminated intravascular coagulation can cause skin lesions, but they are typically not purpuric papules and plaques. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis can also cause skin lesions, but they are typically not tender. Cutaneous mucormycosis is a rare fungal infection that is not typically seen in people with leukemia.

Explanation:
The patient is an immunosuppressed man with a history of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, a lung transplant secondary to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, end-stage kidney disease being treated with hemodialysis, and multiple nonmelanoma skin cancers. He presents with two closely adjacent friable, erythematous nodules with edematous borders on his left elbow. A 4-mm punch biopsy reveals pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia of the epidermis with focal ulceration and multiple collections of neutrophils. There is a mixed inflammatory infiltrate containing neutrophils, plasma cells, histiocytic, and multinucleate giant cells containing refractile spore-like structures. Numerous spores and pseudohyphae are staining positively for pigment.

The most likely diagnosis is phaeohyphomycosis, a fungal infection caused by dematiaceous fungi. These fungi are characterized by the presence of brown or black pigment in their hyphae and spores. Phaeohyphomycosis can occur in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals, but it is more common in the latter. The most common sites of infection are the skin, subcutaneous tissue, and lungs. The clinical presentation of phaeohyphomycosis is variable and depends on the site of infection. Skin lesions may be papular, nodular, or ulcerative. Lung lesions may be cavitary or non-cavitary. Diagnosis of phaeohyphomycosis is made by histopathologic examination of biopsy specimens. Treatment is with antifungal agents, such as amphotericin B or voriconazole.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Aspergillosis is a fungal infection caused by Aspergillus species. It is the most common fungal infection in immunocompromised patients. The most common sites of infection are the lungs, sinuses, and central nervous system. The clinical presentation of aspergillosis is variable and depends on the site of infection. Lung lesions may be cavitary or non-cavitary. Sinus lesions may be polypoid or ulcerative. Central nervous system lesions may be mass lesions or meningitis. Diagnosis of aspergillosis is made by histopathologic examination of biopsy specimens. Treatment is with antifungal agents, such as amphotericin B or voriconazole.
* Mucormycosis is a fungal infection caused by Mucor species. It is a rare but serious infection that can occur in both immunocompetent and immunocompromised individuals. The most common sites of infection are the lungs, sinuses, and central nervous system. The clinical presentation of mucormycosis is variable and depends on the site of infection. Lung lesions may be cavitary or non-cavitary. Sinus lesions may be polypoid or ulcerative. Central nervous system lesions may be mass lesions or meningitis. Diagnosis of mucormycosis is made by histopathologic examination of biopsy specimens. Treatment is with antifungal agents, such as amphotericin B or posaconazole.
* Chromoblastomycosis is a fungal infection caused by Fonsecaea pedrosoi, Phialophora verrucosa, or Cladosporium carrionii. It is a chronic infection that occurs in the skin and subcutaneous tissue. The clinical presentation of chromoblastomycosis is characterized by the development of papules, nodules, or plaques that may ulcerate. Diagnosis of chromoblastomycosis is made by histopathologic examination of biopsy specimens. Treatment is with antifungal agents, such as itraconazole or terbinafine.

Explanation:
The patient presented with bilateral visual disturbances, which were initially attributed to retinal artery occlusions. However, the development of severe headaches and bilateral hearing loss suggests that the patient may have a more serious underlying condition, such as a stroke. A carotid ultrasonography is a non-invasive procedure that can be used to assess the patency of the carotid arteries, which are the major arteries that supply blood to the brain. If the carotid arteries are narrowed or blocked, this can increase the risk of stroke. Therefore, a carotid ultrasonography is the most appropriate next step in the evaluation of this patient.

The other options are not as likely to be helpful in the diagnosis or management of this patient. Otolaryngology is a specialty of medicine that deals with the ear, nose, and throat. While an otolaryngologist may be able to provide additional information about the patient's hearing loss, this is not the most pressing concern at this time. An echocardiogram is a test that uses sound waves to create images of the heart. While this test can be helpful in the diagnosis of certain heart conditions, it is not likely to be helpful in the diagnosis of this patient's headaches or hearing loss. A brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a test that uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create images of the brain. While this test can be helpful in the diagnosis of certain brain conditions, it is not likely to be helpful in the diagnosis of this patient's headaches or hearing loss.

The patient's symptoms of flashes and floaters are consistent with a posterior vitreous detachment (PVD). A PVD is a common occurrence in older adults, and it is usually not associated with any serious problems. In most cases, the symptoms of a PVD will resolve on their own within a few weeks.

In the patient's case, she had a PVD that was diagnosed 7 months prior to presentation. The results of her retinal examination at that time were normal, which suggests that the PVD was not causing any problems. The patient's symptoms of flashes and floaters are likely from her prior PVD, and they are not likely to be caused by anything more serious.

Therefore, the best course of action is to observe the patient and monitor her symptoms. If her symptoms do not resolve within a few weeks, or if they worsen, then further testing may be necessary. However, at this time, there is no need to order any additional tests or to initiate any treatment.

The other options are not correct for the following reasons:

* Option B (Cardiology consultation and workup for hypercoagulability) is not necessary because there is no evidence to suggest that the patient has a hypercoagulable disorder.
* Option C (Fluorescein angiography and workup for infectious and inflammatory etiologies) is not necessary because the patient's symptoms are consistent with a PVD, which is a common and usually benign condition.
* Option D (Treat with oral prednisone 60 mg daily followed by a slow taper) is not necessary because the patient's symptoms are likely from her prior PVD, and they are not likely to be caused by anything more serious.

The patient has conjunctival hyperemia and targetoid lesions on the trunk and extremities. These are classic findings of _Lyme disease_, an infection caused by the bacterium _Borrelia burgdorferi_. Lyme disease is spread to humans through the bite of infected blacklegged ticks. The most common symptoms of Lyme disease are fever, headache, fatigue, and a characteristic skin rash called erythema migrans. In some cases, Lyme disease can also cause joint pain, arthritis, and neurological problems.

The treatment for Lyme disease is antibiotics. The type of antibiotic and the length of treatment will depend on the stage of the disease and the patient's symptoms. In most cases, a course of oral antibiotics will be effective. However, in some cases, intravenous antibiotics may be necessary.

The other options are incorrect because:

* Option B is incorrect because removing the foreign body with forceps would not treat the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, which is Lyme disease.
* Option C is incorrect because excising the affected conjunctiva would also not treat the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms.
* Option D is incorrect because a computed tomographic scan of the orbits is not necessary to diagnose or treat Lyme disease.

Anti-Ro and anti-La antibody testing are not indicated in this case, as they are not associated with conjunctival lesions. Vitamin levels, including vitamin A (retinol), may be low in patients with malnutrition, but this is not the most likely explanation for the patient's conjunctival lesions.

Explanation:

The patient is an elderly woman with sudden-onset upper abdominal pain and vomiting for 7 days. She underwent gastric surgery more than 25 years ago, of which no details were available. On general physical examination, her vital signs were stable. The abdomen was soft and nondistended. There was epigastric tenderness. The results from initial blood tests, including hemogram, liver and kidney function tests, and serum amylase, were unremarkable. Contrast-enhanced abdominal computed tomography (CT) was performed. The CT scan showed a large, heterogeneous mass in the gastric fundus. The mass was partially enhancing and had a central ulceration. There was no evidence of metastasis.

The most likely diagnosis is GIST. GIST is a rare, mesenchymal tumor that can arise from the gastrointestinal tract. It is most commonly found in the stomach, but can also occur in the small intestine, colon, and esophagus. GISTs are usually diagnosed in adults, with a median age at diagnosis of 60 years. The most common symptoms of GIST are abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. GISTs can be diagnosed with CT scan, MRI, or PET scan. Treatment of GIST depends on the size, location, and stage of the tumor. Surgical resection is the most common treatment for GIST. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy may also be used. The prognosis for patients with GIST is generally good, with a 5-year survival rate of over 70%.

The other possible diagnoses are not as likely in this case. Gastric bezoar is a mass of undigested food that can form in the stomach. It is most common in people with certain medical conditions, such as gastroparesis or Crohn's disease. Gastric bezoar can cause abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. It can also be a cause of gastric outlet obstruction. Jejunogastric intussusception is a condition in which a portion of the small intestine telescopes into the stomach. It is most common in children, but can also occur in adults. Jejunogastric intussusception can cause abdominal pain, vomiting, and bloody diarrhea. Gastric polyp with bleeding is a condition in which a polyp, or growth, forms on the lining of the stomach. Polyps can be benign or malignant. Gastric polyps with bleeding can cause abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. They can also be a cause of anemia.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is GIST.

 76%|███████▌  | 1161/1525 [4:25:22<1:13:00, 12.04s/it]The answer is C: Primary hyperparathyroidism.

Primary hyperparathyroidism is a condition in which the parathyroid glands produce too much parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH is a hormone that helps to regulate the levels of calcium and phosphate in the blood. When too much PTH is produced, it can lead to high blood calcium levels, low blood phosphate levels, and other health problems.

The patient in this case has several symptoms that are consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism, including:

* Headache
* Facial swelling
* Anorexia
* Malaise
* Severely elevated blood pressure
* Periorbital and 1+ bipedal pitting edema
* Mild tenderness to percussion of both flanks
* Elevated serum calcium level
* Elevated serum phosphate level
* Severe bilateral hydronephrosis with renal cortical thinning and obstructing calculi at both ureteropelvic junctions

The CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis shows bilateral obstructing calculi at the ureteropelvic junctions, which is a classic finding in primary hyperparathyroidism. The patient's symptoms and laboratory findings are also consistent with primary hyperparathyroidism.

The other possible diagnoses are not as likely. Hypervitaminosis D is a condition in which the body has too much vitamin D. Symptoms of hypervitaminosis D can include headache, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, loss of appetite, weight loss, muscle weakness, fatigue, and confusion. The patient in this case does not have any of these symptoms.

Malignant neoplasm is a general term for a cancerous tumor. Symptoms of malignant neoplasm can vary depending on the type of cancer and its location. The patient in this case does not have any symptoms that are specific to cancer.

Sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect many parts of the body, including the lungs, lymph nodes, skin, eyes, and heart. Symptoms of sarcoidosis can vary depending on the organs involved. The patient in this case does not have any symptoms that are specific to sarcoidosis.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is primary hyperparathyroidism.

 76%|███████▌  | 1162/1525 [4:25:39<1:20:30, 13.31s/it]Answer: D. PTH resistance

Explanation:
The patient has a high level of parathyroid hormone (PTH), but a low level of calcium. This suggests that the patient has resistance to the effects of PTH. PTH is a hormone that helps to regulate calcium levels in the blood. It does this by stimulating the release of calcium from the bones, increasing the absorption of calcium from the intestines, and decreasing the excretion of calcium in the urine. In the patient, the high level of PTH is not able to raise the calcium level in the blood, suggesting that the patient has resistance to the effects of PTH.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Hungry bone syndrome is a condition that occurs after parathyroidectomy, when the parathyroid glands are removed. In this condition, the bones release calcium into the blood in order to compensate for the loss of parathyroid hormone. This can lead to hypocalcemia. However, the patient in this case does not have a history of parathyroidectomy, so hungry bone syndrome is not likely.
* Primary hyperparathyroidism is a condition that occurs when the parathyroid glands produce too much parathyroid hormone. This can lead to hypercalcemia. However, the patient in this case has hypocalcemia, so primary hyperparathyroidism is not likely.
* Chronic kidney disease is a condition that can lead to hypocalcemia. However, the patient in this case does not have any other symptoms of chronic kidney disease, such as elevated blood urea nitrogen or creatinine levels. Additionally, the patient's phosphorus level is normal, which is unusual for someone with chronic kidney disease. Therefore, chronic kidney disease is not likely.

The leukocytosis, elevated C-reactive protein level, and mild renal dysfunction are also supportive of this diagnosis. Acute myocardial infarction is unlikely in this patient given his normal cardiac enzyme levels and the absence of any other risk factors for coronary artery disease.

 76%|███████▋  | 1164/1525 [4:26:10<1:27:13, 14.50s/it]The answer is A. Gorlin syndrome.

Gorlin syndrome, also known as nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), osteomas, odontogenic keratocysts, and other abnormalities. BCCs are the most common type of skin cancer, and they are often associated with Gorlin syndrome. Osteomas are benign tumors of bone, and they are also common in people with Gorlin syndrome. Odontogenic keratocysts are cysts that form in the jaw, and they can cause tooth displacement and pain. Other features of Gorlin syndrome can include pits in the palms and soles, a large head, and a cleft lip or palate.

The genetic defect in Gorlin syndrome is a mutation in the APC gene. The APC gene is responsible for producing a protein called adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). APC is a tumor suppressor gene, which means that it helps to prevent the development of tumors. When the APC gene is mutated, it can lead to the development of multiple tumors, including BCCs, osteomas, and odontogenic keratocysts.

The diagnosis of Gorlin syndrome is based on a person's medical history, a physical examination, and genetic testing. There is no cure for Gorlin syndrome, but treatment can help to manage the symptoms and prevent the development of tumors. Treatment may include surgery to remove tumors, medication to prevent the growth of tumors, and sun protection to reduce the risk of skin cancer.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not associated with Gorlin syndrome. Turcot syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the development of colon cancer and brain tumors. Gardner syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by the development of multiple BCCs, osteomas, and other abnormalities, including colon cancer. Turner syndrome is a genetic disorder characterized by the absence of one of the X chromosomes in females.

 76%|███████▋  | 1165/1525 [4:26:26<1:30:42, 15.12s/it]Answer: C. Laryngeal schwannoma

Explanation:

The patient is a man in his 50s who was referred to the otolaryngology clinic because of a globus sensation in the throat and a 6-month history of throat pain. His medical history was significant for hypertension, dyslipidemia, and cigarette smoking. Flexible fiber-optic laryngoscopy revealed a 15-mm submucosal swelling in the right aryepiglottic fold. The vocal folds were free of lesions and had intact motion. Findings from the rest of the head and neck examination were unremarkable. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the neck revealed a submucosal hypodense supraglottic mass on the right side that was compressing the airway. A magnetic resonance imaging study (MRI) of the neck demonstrated a soft-tissue mass measuring 27 × 17 mm and causing deviation of the right aryepiglottic fold medially and compressing the airway. The patient underwent direct laryngoscopy, and a submucosal mass was observed in the right aryepiglottic fold. The mass was dissected submucosally, excised completely, and sent for a histopathologic examination. Results from the S100 protein immunostain were positive. The postoperative course was uneventful, and after 5 months, the patient had no detectable laryngeal lesions and the vocal fold movement was intact.

Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is laryngeal schwannoma. Schwannomas are benign tumors that arise from Schwann cells, which are the cells that myelinate peripheral nerves. They are most commonly found in the head and neck region, and the larynx is the third most common site after the acoustic nerve and the spinal cord. Schwannomas are typically solitary tumors, and they are more common in men than in women.

The clinical presentation of a laryngeal schwannoma is variable. Some patients may be asymptomatic, while others may present with symptoms such as hoarseness, dysphagia, otalgia, or a neck mass. The diagnosis is typically made with imaging studies, such as CT or MRI, which can show the characteristic appearance of a schwannoma. Definitive diagnosis is made with histopathologic examination of a biopsy specimen.

The treatment of laryngeal schwannoma is surgical excision. This can be performed with open surgery or with endoscopic surgery. The goal of surgery is to completely remove the tumor while preserving the function of the larynx. The prognosis for patients with laryngeal schwannoma is excellent. With complete surgical excision, the recurrence rate is low.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma is a malignant tumor that arises from the squamous cells that line the larynx. It is the most common type of laryngeal cancer. The clinical presentation of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma is variable, but it typically includes hoarseness, dysphagia, and otalgia. The diagnosis is made with imaging studies, such as CT or MRI, and with biopsy. The treatment of laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma is surgery, radiation therapy, or a combination of both. The prognosis for patients with laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma depends on the stage of the disease.
* Laryngeal neurofibroma is a benign tumor that arises from Schwann cells. It is a rare tumor, and it is more common in patients with neurofibromatosis type 2. The clinical presentation of laryngeal neurofibroma is variable, but it typically includes hoarseness, dysphagia, and otalgia. The diagnosis is made with imaging studies, such as CT or MRI, and with biopsy. The treatment of laryngeal neurofibroma is surgical excision. The prognosis for patients with laryngeal neurofibroma is excellent.
* Laryngeal paraganglioma is a rare, benign tumor that arises from paraganglia, which are small, hormone-producing glands that are found throughout the body. The clinical presentation of laryngeal paraganglioma is variable, but it typically includes hoarseness, dysphagia, and otalgia. The diagnosis is made with imaging studies, such as CT or MRI, and with biopsy. The treatment of laryngeal paraganglioma is surgical excision. The prognosis for patients with laryngeal paraganglioma is excellent.

 76%|███████▋  | 1166/1525 [4:26:42<1:32:37, 15.48s/it]Answer: C

Explanation:
The patient is a woman in her 40s with a 8-year history of progressive dyspnea associated with nonproductive cough. She has no history of smoking, type B symptoms, angiotensin-converting enzyme-inhibitor use, or known cardiac pathologic abnormalities. Findings from a complete head and neck examination were within normal limits aside from laryngeal findings. Flexible laryngoscopy with videostroboscopy revealed right vocal fold polyp and left vocal fold desquamation, with bilateral linear bands along the vocal folds. Initial treatment with proton pump inhibitors and evaluation by the gastroenterology unit did not improve her symptoms, so further workup was undertaken. Noncontrast computed tomography (CT) revealed numerous calcified subglottic and tracheal nodules extending from the cricoid to the left mainstem bronchus. She underwent direct laryngoscopy and bronchoscopy with biopsies. On induction, subglottic firm mass consistent with calcification prevented passage of an endotracheal tube, and the patient’s airway was secured with a rigid bronchoscope. Further examination revealed edema of the vocal folds with multiple submucosal masses in the subglottis and upper trachea. The lesions were varying sizes, and not all were calcified. They affected the anterior cartilaginous trachea and the posterior membranous portion. Biopsy specimens of representative lesions revealed amorphous, eosinophilic material with calcification, metaplastic ossification, and multinucleated foreign-body giant cells. The disease was treated with debulking of scattered lesions from the glottis through to both main stem bronchi and airway dilation, which provided symptomatic relief.

The most likely diagnosis is primary laryngotracheobronchial amyloidosis. This is a rare disease characterized by the deposition of amyloid protein in the airway. Amyloid is a protein that is produced by abnormal cells and can accumulate in various organs and tissues, causing a variety of problems. In the airway, amyloid deposition can lead to obstruction, inflammation, and scarring. This can cause symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, and hoarseness.

The diagnosis of primary laryngotracheobronchial amyloidosis is made based on the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging studies. CT scan of the chest is often used to diagnose the disease. Biopsy of the airway is also necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

There is no cure for primary laryngotracheobronchial amyloidosis. Treatment is aimed at relieving symptoms and preventing complications. This may include medications to reduce inflammation, airway dilation, and surgery to remove obstructing lesions.

The prognosis for patients with primary laryngotracheobronchial amyloidosis varies depending on the extent of disease and the patient's overall health. With treatment, most patients can expect to have a good quality of life. However, the disease can be progressive and may lead to death in some cases.

The other possible diagnoses are endobronchial sarcoidosis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and tracheobronchial osteochondropathia. Endobronchial sarcoidosis is a rare condition characterized by the formation of granulomas (small, inflammatory nodules) in the airways. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis is a rare autoimmune disease that can affect the lungs, kidneys, and other organs. Tracheobronchial osteochondropathia is a condition that causes the formation of bone and cartilage in the airways.

The patient's history, physical examination, and imaging studies are not consistent with any of these other diagnoses. The patient does not have any of the typical symptoms of sarcoidosis, such as fever, night sweats, and fatigue. She does not have any of the typical symptoms of granulomatosis with polyangiitis, such as hemoptysis, renal failure, or skin lesions. She does not have any of the typical symptoms of tracheobronchial osteochondropathia, such as stridor, hoarseness, or wheezing.

The patient's biopsy results are also consistent with primary laryngotracheobronchial amyloidosis. The biopsy showed the presence of amorphous, eosinophilic material with calcification, metaplastic ossification, and multinucleated foreign-body giant cells. These findings are characteristic of amyloidosis.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is primary laryngotracheobronchial amyloidosis.

Explanation:
The patient had a history of radiotherapy to the skin of the right breast. Two months after the last dose of radiation, she developed pruritic pustules and papules on the skin of the ipsilateral right breast. Levoceterizine gave some relief of the itch. Physical examination findings showed pustules surrounding the areola on the right breast with an increasing number in the submammary fold.

The most likely diagnosis is a reaction to radiotherapy. Radiation therapy can cause a variety of skin reactions, including erythema, desquamation, and folliculitis. Eosinophilic, polymorphic, and pruritic eruption is a rare but well-described reaction to radiotherapy. It is characterized by the development of pruritic papules and pustules on the skin that has been irradiated. The eruption usually resolves within a few weeks of stopping radiation therapy.

Bacterial folliculitis is a common skin infection that can be caused by a variety of bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pyogenes. It is characterized by the development of small, red, tender papules or pustules on the skin, often in the hair follicles. The infection can be treated with antibiotics.

Herpes infection is a viral infection that can cause cold sores, genital herpes, and shingles. It is characterized by the development of blisters on the skin. The blisters usually clear up on their own within a few weeks.

Pityrosporum folliculitis is a fungal infection of the hair follicles. It is characterized by the development of small, red, scaly papules on the skin, often on the chest, back, and shoulders. The infection can be treated with antifungal medications.

The patient presented with an annular skin lesion on her anterior neck that enlarged and developed central clearing. She had no symptoms other than mild local itching. She lived in North Carolina, an area with a high prevalence of Lyme disease, and had no recent travel or known tick bite. The lesion is consistent with erythema migrans, the characteristic skin lesion of early Lyme disease. The patient's history and physical examination are also consistent with Lyme disease.

The first-line treatment for Lyme disease is oral doxycycline for 14 days. The patient was prescribed 14 days of doxycycline by her pediatrician. She should complete the full course of antibiotics, even though the lesion has faded.

Serologic testing for Lyme disease is not always reliable, especially in early infection. The patient's serologic test was positive, but this could be a false positive. The patient should have a repeat Lyme disease serology test in 1 month to evaluate her response to treatment.

Skin biopsy is not necessary to diagnose Lyme disease. It is not always helpful in making the diagnosis, and it can be expensive.

Discontinuation of doxycycline and restarting topical antifungal cream is not indicated. The patient has Lyme disease, not fungal infection.

The patient has pancytopenia, which is a condition in which all three types of blood cells (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets) are decreased. This can be caused by a variety of conditions, including infections, autoimmune disorders, and cancer. In this case, the patient also has hypothyroidism, which can also cause pancytopenia.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient should be to order tests to rule out specific causes of pancytopenia. Parvovirus B19 is a virus that can cause anemia and pancytopenia. It is a common infection, especially in children. The virus can be spread through contact with infected saliva or blood.

To test for parvovirus B19, the doctor can order a blood test to detect antibodies to the virus. A positive antibody test indicates that the patient has been infected with the virus in the past. The doctor can also order a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to detect the presence of the virus's DNA in the blood.

If the patient tests positive for parvovirus B19, the doctor will likely recommend treatment with supportive care, such as blood transfusions and antibiotics to prevent secondary infections. The patient will also need to be monitored for complications of parvovirus B19 infection, such as anemia and pancytopenia.

A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is not necessary in this case. The patient does not have any symptoms that suggest a cancer or other serious underlying condition. A CT scan would not be helpful in diagnosing or treating parvovirus B19 infection.

Increasing the dose of levothyroxine is not the next step in the evaluation of this patient. The patient's hypothyroidism is already being treated with levothyroxine. Increasing the dose of levothyroxine would not be helpful in diagnosing or treating parvovirus B19 infection.

Obtaining serum methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels is not necessary in this case. MMA levels are elevated in some cases of vitamin B12 deficiency. However, the patient's vitamin B12 level is normal. Obtaining MMA levels would not be helpful in diagnosing or treating parvovirus B19 infection.

The patient is presenting with a number of concerning symptoms, including altered mental status, acute kidney injury requiring dialysis, and painful, dusky skin discoloration on his distal extremities. These symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of postprocedural blue toes, a rare but serious complication of coronary artery bypass graft surgery.

Postprocedural blue toes is caused by microvascular injury to the toes, which can lead to ischemia and necrosis. The diagnosis is typically made based on the patient's history and physical examination findings. Laboratory tests, such as serum liver function tests, lipase level, and ophthalmologic evaluation, can be helpful in confirming the diagnosis and ruling out other possible causes.

There is no specific treatment for postprocedural blue toes. Treatment is typically supportive and includes measures to improve blood flow to the toes, such as elevation of the legs and the use of vasodilators. In some cases, amputation may be necessary.

The patient in this case is at high risk for multiorgan damage, as evidenced by his altered mental status and acute kidney injury. Therefore, it is important to obtain serum liver function tests, lipase level, and ophthalmologic evaluation to monitor for signs of multiorgan damage. Additionally, the patient should be started on supportive measures, such as elevation of the legs and the use of vasodilators.

The other options are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate management for postprocedural blue toes. Chest computed tomography angiography is not necessary in the absence of signs of pulmonary embolism. Surgical consult for amputation is not necessary at this time, as the patient does not have any signs of irreversible tissue damage. Heparin and thrombolytic therapy are not recommended for postprocedural blue toes, as they have not been shown to be effective.

Explanation:

Argyria is a condition characterized by a permanent blue-gray discoloration of the skin and other tissues caused by the accumulation of silver in the body. It is most commonly caused by the ingestion or inhalation of silver salts, such as those used in photography and some folk remedies.

The patient in this case presented with a 5-year history of gradually increasing blue discoloration of her ears. She had mild knee arthralgia that was treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). She was seeing an ophthalmologist annually regarding brown spots on both eyes diagnosed as conjunctival nevi. No other family members were similarly affected. As an infant, her mother had taken her to their physician owing to dark discoloration of her diapers, but this was not investigated further.

Examination revealed slate blue macular pigmentation within the antihelix and conchal bowls of both ears. There were prominent dark brown deposits on the conjunctivae medial and lateral to the iris of both eyes. No other pigmentary changes were noted on the skin or mucosal surfaces. A punch biopsy specimen from the pigmented area on the left ear was obtained.

The histopathologic findings of the biopsy specimen were consistent with argyria. The dermis was heavily pigmented with silver granules, which were also present in the adjacent cartilage.

The patient's history of gradual onset of blue discoloration of the ears, as well as the presence of brown deposits on the conjunctivae, are consistent with a diagnosis of argyria. The histopathologic findings of the biopsy specimen also support this diagnosis.

Acute intermittent porphyria is a rare genetic disorder that affects the production of heme, a component of hemoglobin. It is characterized by acute attacks of abdominal pain, vomiting, and neurological symptoms. The skin is not affected in acute intermittent porphyria.

Diffuse melanosis in metastatic melanoma is a condition characterized by the spread of melanoma cells to the skin, where they produce melanin. This can lead to a diffuse, brown discoloration of the skin. The patient in this case does not have any evidence of metastatic melanoma.

Alkaptonuria is a rare genetic disorder that affects the metabolism of phenylalanine and tyrosine. It is characterized by the accumulation of homogentisic acid in the body, which can lead to ochronosis, a condition characterized by the deposition of black pigment in the cartilage and connective tissues. The patient in this case does not have any evidence of ochronosis.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for the patient in this case is argyria.

Explanation:

Neonatal candidiasis is a common skin infection in newborns. It is caused by the yeast Candida albicans, which is a normal inhabitant of the skin and mucous membranes. The infection is usually acquired during passage through the birth canal, but it can also be acquired from contact with contaminated surfaces or people.

Erythema toxicum neonatorum is a common skin rash that occurs in up to 50% of newborns. It is characterized by erythematous papules and pustules that are distributed on the trunk and extremities. The rash is usually self-limited and resolves within a few days or weeks.

Congenital dermatophytosis is a fungal infection of the skin that can occur in newborns. It is usually caused by the fungus Trichophyton rubrum, which can be acquired from the mother's skin or from contaminated surfaces. The infection is characterized by scaling, erythema, and papules or pustules.

Congenital cutaneous candidiasis is the most likely diagnosis in this case because the infant has a history of maternal yeast infection, the lesions are distributed on the trunk, arms, and extensor thighs, and the lesions are not present in the diaper area. Additionally, the potassium hydroxide staining showed numerous yeast forms, which is a characteristic finding of candidiasis.

Erythema toxicum neonatorum is less likely because the lesions are not present in the diaper area. Additionally, the rash is usually self-limited and resolves within a few days or weeks, which is not the case in this patient.

Congenital dermatophytosis is less likely because the lesions are not present in the diaper area. Additionally, the infection is usually caused by the fungus Trichophyton rubrum, which was not found in this patient.

Explanation:

The patient in the case presented with a 20-year history of slowly progressive red-to-brown pruritic hyperkeratotic papules and reticulated hyperpigmentation involving her face, neck, chest, back, and upper and lower extremities. She was previously diagnosed with Darier disease after biopsy revealed acantholytic dyskeratosis. She was treated with fluorouracil and tazarotene, 0.1%, cream with mild improvement, but she continued to develop new lesions.

The clinical findings in this case are most consistent with classic Dowling-Degos disease. Dowling-Degos disease is a rare, chronic, progressive, acquired dermatosis characterized by reticulate hyperpigmentation and follicular papules. The lesions typically begin on the face and neck and then spread to the trunk and extremities. The disease is more common in men than women and usually presents in the fourth to sixth decade of life.

The histopathologic findings in Dowling-Degos disease are characteristic and include hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and elongation of the rete ridges. There is also focal acantholysis without dyskeratosis.

The differential diagnosis for Dowling-Degos disease includes Darier disease, Grover disease, and Kitamura disease. Darier disease is a hereditary disorder characterized by keratotic papules and plaques. Grover disease is a self-limiting eruption of pruritic papules and plaques that typically occurs in elderly men. Kitamura disease is a rare, chronic, progressive dermatosis characterized by reticulate hyperpigmentation and follicular papules.

The patient in this case was previously diagnosed with Darier disease, but the clinical and histopathologic findings are more consistent with classic Dowling-Degos disease. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is classic Dowling-Degos disease.

The patient has recurrent pseudophakic endophthalmitis, which is a serious infection of the eye that can lead to vision loss. The first line of treatment for pseudophakic endophthalmitis is intravitreal antibiotics. However, in cases of recurrent infection, removal of the intraocular lens (IOL) and capsule may be necessary. This is because the IOL can act as a nidus for infection, and the capsule can provide a biofilm that protects bacteria from antibiotics.

In this case, the patient has had two episodes of pseudophakic endophthalmitis, despite treatment with intravitreal antibiotics. The patient also has evidence of cystoid macular edema, which is a complication of inflammation that can lead to vision loss. Therefore, it is recommended that the patient undergo pars plana vitrectomy with removal of the IOL and capsule. This procedure will remove the source of infection and reduce the risk of further vision loss.

The other options are not as appropriate in this case. Restarting topical prednisolone acetate and/or ofloxacin eyedrops would not be effective in treating a recurrent infection. Repeating vitreous biopsy and intravitreal injection of antibiotics may be helpful in some cases, but it is not as effective as pars plana vitrectomy in removing the source of infection. Intravitreal and/or posterior sub-Tenon triamcinolone injection can be used to treat inflammation, but it will not treat the infection.

Explanation: The patient has acute increase in intraocular pressure (IOP) in a patient with a glaucoma drainage implant. The most likely cause is obstruction of the tube. Applying digital pressure over the plate is the most appropriate first step to dislodge the obstruction and lower the IOP. Repositioning the tube or performing laser iridotomy or iridoplasty are not appropriate first steps because they would not address the obstruction of the tube. Vitrectomy is not a necessary first step because the obstruction is not in the vitreous.

The patient's presentation is consistent with pattern dystrophy, a hereditary retinal disorder characterized by annular areas of outer retinal hypopigmentation and thinning. Pattern dystrophy is caused by mutations in the NR2E3 gene, which encodes a protein that is essential for the development and function of photoreceptor cells. There is no cure for pattern dystrophy, but there are treatments that can help to slow the progression of the disease. Genetic counseling and potential testing for an NR2E3 mutation can help the patient to understand her risk of developing pattern dystrophy in other family members and to make informed decisions about her care.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A (Perform an intravitreous injection of an anti–vascular endothelial growth factor) is incorrect because anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections are not effective in treating pattern dystrophy.
* Option C (Order testing for antirecoverin antibodies) is incorrect because antirecoverin antibodies are not associated with pattern dystrophy.
* Option D (Perform a vitreous biopsy) is incorrect because a vitreous biopsy is not necessary to diagnose pattern dystrophy.

The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with non-exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Non-exudative AMD is characterized by the accumulation of extracellular fluid in the macula, which can lead to vision loss. Fluorescein angiography shows hypofluorescence over the area of neurosensory detachment, which is consistent with the diagnosis of non-exudative AMD.

Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agents are medications that are injected into the vitreous cavity of the eye. They work by blocking the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a protein that promotes the growth of new blood vessels. Anti-VEGF agents have been shown to be effective in reducing the progression of AMD and improving vision in patients with this condition.

Obtaining serum chemistry with radiographs of the extremities, obtaining neuroimaging of the brain and orbits, and obtaining serum titers of viral antibodies are not necessary in this case. The patient's history and examination findings are not consistent with any other medical conditions that would require these tests.

In conclusion, the correct answer is: **A. Administer an intravitreous anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) agent in the left eye.**

Explanation:
The patient's presentation with intermittent episodes of right hand and leg discoordination and paresthesia of increasing frequency 2 weeks prior to presentation, as well as patchy enhancement in the left basal ganglia and corona radiata concerning for demyelinating lesions, is consistent with a diagnosis of carotid artery dissection. The imaging findings of near occlusion of the proximal left internal carotid artery on computed tomographic neck angiography and a string sign in the proximal left internal carotid artery on cerebral arteriogram are also consistent with this diagnosis.

Carotid artery dissection is a tear in the wall of the carotid artery, which is a major artery that supplies blood to the brain. It can occur spontaneously or as a result of trauma. Symptoms of carotid artery dissection can vary depending on the location and extent of the tear. They can include headache, neck pain, facial pain, arm or leg pain, dizziness, and vision problems.

Carotid artery dissection is a serious condition that can lead to stroke. Treatment typically involves surgery to repair the tear.

Atherosclerotic plaques are fatty deposits that can build up inside the walls of arteries. Over time, these plaques can rupture, leading to a blood clot. A blood clot can block the flow of blood to the brain, causing a stroke.

Fibromuscular dysplasia is a rare condition that affects the walls of arteries. It can cause the arteries to narrow or widen, which can lead to blood clots and strokes.

Carotid aneurysm is a bulge in the wall of a carotid artery. Aneurysms can rupture, leading to bleeding and stroke.

In this case, the patient's presentation, imaging findings, and laboratory results are most consistent with a diagnosis of carotid artery dissection.

Explanation:
The most likely diagnosis is streptococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS), which is a rare but life-threatening complication of group A streptococcal (GAS) infection. STSS is characterized by fever, hypotension, multiorgan failure, and a characteristic rash. The rash is often described as "purpuric" or "petechial," and it can be widespread or localized. In addition to the rash, patients with STSS may also have other findings, such as fever, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and conjunctivitis.

The diagnosis of STSS is made clinically, based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings. The laboratory findings in STSS often include leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, and elevated levels of C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate.

The treatment of STSS is with antibiotics, such as penicillin or clindamycin. In severe cases, patients may also need to be treated with fluids and vasopressors.

The prognosis for patients with STSS is generally good, but the mortality rate can be as high as 50%. The risk of death is highest in patients who have multiorgan failure.

The following are some of the key features that support the diagnosis of STSS in this case:

* The patient had a recent history of GAS infection (tonsillitis).
* The patient developed a fever, hypotension, and multiorgan failure.
* The patient had a characteristic rash.
* The laboratory findings were consistent with STSS.

The following are some of the key features that make the other diagnoses less likely:

* Herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is more likely to cause a localized rash, such as herpes zoster.
* Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection is more likely to cause a localized infection, such as pneumonia.
* Streptococcus pyogenes infection is more likely to cause a generalized infection, such as cellulitis.
* Neisseria meningitidis infection is more likely to cause meningitis.

Explanation:

The patient is a teenage girl with recurrent episodes of palpitations for 6 consecutive years. The resting 12-lead electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with no preexcitation or repolarization abnormalities. There were incessant multiple runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia with right bundle branch block morphologic features. QRS complexes were negative in the rest of the precordial leads (V2-V6) and in leads I and avL, but positive in III, avR, and avF, suggesting a left (lateral) ventricular apical origin. The echocardiogram showed no structural abnormalities. The patient was prescribed sotalol but her symptoms did not improve. Invasive electrophysiological mapping of the left ventricle endocardium demonstrated that the ventricular tachycardia probably originated from the epicardial surface of left ventricular apex.

The next step in management is to map and ablate the epicardium. This is a procedure that uses catheters to deliver radiofrequency energy to the area of the heart where the ventricular tachycardia is originating. This can be a curative procedure, and it is the preferred treatment for patients with recurrent ventricular tachycardia that is resistant to medical therapy.

The other options are not as appropriate in this case. Adding a second antiarrhythmic drug would not be likely to be effective, as the patient has already failed to respond to sotalol. Implanting a cardioverter defibrillator would be a reasonable option if the patient was at high risk for sudden cardiac death, but this is not the case in this patient. Performing cardiac magnetic resonance imaging would not provide any additional information that would change the management of this patient.

Explanation:

The patient in the case presented with a 2-year history of gradual-onset, left-sided hearing loss. It was associated with a whistling tinnitus and occasional sharp otalgia lasting for a few minutes, approximately twice a week, without otorrhea. He reported labyrinthitis 2 years previously with possible reduced hearing afterward. He took no regular medications, had no allergies or clinically significant family history, and was an occasional smoker and alcohol drinker. Examination showed a smooth mass behind the left tympanic membrane. Findings from flexible nasoendoscopy were unremarkable. There was no palpable lymphadenopathy. Pure-tone audiometry demonstrated a mixed hearing loss on the left side. Results from tympanometry of the left ear were normal. A computed tomographic scan showed an expansile ground-glass density lesion arising within the lateral aspect of the otic capsule on the left (Figure, A and B). The lesion eroded into the lateral aspect of the basal and second turns of the cochlea as well as the tympanic portion of the facial nerve canal. Magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated a 7 × 8-mm lesion arising from the otic capsule, with mild uniform enhancement following gadolinium. A technetium bone scan showed a lesion in the temporal bone, and a focus of increased uptake in the left lateral eighth rib (no fracture was demonstrated) (Figure, C). To obtain a diagnosis, a bony sample was obtained, which consisted of small fragments of woven bony tissue with mild osteocyte nuclei enlargement and hyperchromasia, with no sign of neoplasia.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is Paget disease. Paget disease is a metabolic bone disease characterized by excessive bone remodeling. It is a common disorder, affecting about 3% of people over the age of 50. The cause of Paget disease is unknown, but it is thought to be a genetic disorder.

The clinical features of Paget disease vary depending on the stage of the disease. In the early stages, the disease is usually asymptomatic. However, as the disease progresses, patients may develop bone pain, tenderness, and deformity. Paget disease can also lead to hearing loss, vision problems, and neurological problems.

The diagnosis of Paget disease is made based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. A bone scan is often used to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment for Paget disease is aimed at relieving symptoms and preventing complications. Treatment options include medication, surgery, and radiation therapy.

In the case presented, the patient's history and physical examination are consistent with Paget disease. The computed tomographic scan and magnetic resonance imaging findings are also consistent with Paget disease. The bone biopsy findings are diagnostic of Paget disease.

The other possible diagnoses in this case are fibrous dysplasia, exostosis, and otosclerosis. Fibrous dysplasia is a non-cancerous bone disorder characterized by the replacement of normal bone with fibrous tissue. Exostosis is a benign growth that projects from the surface of a bone. Otosclerosis is a disorder that affects the small bones in the middle ear.

The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory tests are not consistent with fibrous dysplasia, exostosis, or otosclerosis. The computed tomographic scan and magnetic resonance imaging findings are also not consistent with these diagnoses. The bone biopsy findings are not diagnostic of these diagnoses.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is Paget disease.

Explanation:

Angiosarcoma is a rare, aggressive type of cancer that starts in the blood vessels. It can occur anywhere in the body, but it is most common in the skin, soft tissues, and liver. Angiosarcoma of the thyroid is a very rare form of cancer, accounting for less than 1% of all thyroid cancers. It is more common in women than men, and it typically occurs in people who are in their 60s or 70s.

The symptoms of angiosarcoma of the thyroid can vary depending on the size and location of the tumor. Some common symptoms include a painless mass in the neck, hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, and difficulty breathing. If the tumor spreads to other parts of the body, it can cause symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, and bone pain.

There is no known cause of angiosarcoma of the thyroid. However, certain factors may increase the risk of developing the disease, such as exposure to radiation, certain medications, and certain genetic syndromes.

The diagnosis of angiosarcoma of the thyroid is made based on a physical examination, imaging studies, and biopsy. Treatment for angiosarcoma of the thyroid typically involves surgery to remove the tumor, followed by radiation therapy and chemotherapy. The prognosis for patients with angiosarcoma of the thyroid is poor. The average survival time for patients with this disease is less than two years.

The other options are incorrect because they are not types of cancer that can occur in the thyroid.

Explanation:
The patient is an elderly woman with a long-standing history of hoarseness. She has no significant medical history and does not smoke. The physical examination is remarkable for a rough voice. Flexible nasolaryngoscopy reveals a white sessile lesion starting at the right midfold on the superior and medial surfaces that crossed the midline to involve the entire left vocal fold. The histopathologic images of the biopsied lesion show a moderately differentiated squamous cell carcinoma.

The differential diagnosis for a white sessile lesion of the vocal fold includes laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma, laryngeal actinomyces, laryngeal candidiasis, and laryngeal amyloidosis. Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma is the most common malignancy of the larynx. It is a disease of the elderly, with a peak incidence in the sixth and seventh decades of life. The most common presenting symptom is hoarseness. Other symptoms may include a lump in the neck, dysphagia, and odynophagia.

Laryngeal actinomyces is a rare infection caused by the bacterium Actinomyces israelii. It is most commonly seen in patients with underlying lung disease, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The most common presenting symptom is hoarseness. Other symptoms may include a lump in the neck, dysphagia, and odynophagia.

Laryngeal candidiasis is a fungal infection caused by the yeast Candida albicans. It is most commonly seen in patients who are immunocompromised, such as those with diabetes mellitus or AIDS. The most common presenting symptom is hoarseness. Other symptoms may include a lump in the neck, dysphagia, and odynophagia.

Laryngeal amyloidosis is a rare disorder characterized by the deposition of amyloid protein in the larynx. It is most commonly seen in patients with chronic inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis or Crohn's disease. The most common presenting symptom is hoarseness. Other symptoms may include a lump in the neck, dysphagia, and odynophagia.

In the case presented, the patient is an elderly woman with a long-standing history of hoarseness. She has no significant medical history and does not smoke.

Explanation:
The patient is a 47-year-old woman with a history of a mediastinal mass. She has no recent weight loss, muscle weakness, or diplopia. Her surgical history is significant for having undergone a cesarean section. She denied any radiation exposure. A computed tomographic scan of the chest revealed a mediastinal mass. The patient was referred to surgery for evaluation.

A physical examination identified a midline trachea, no significant thyromegaly in the neck, no significant lymphadenopathy, and no additional significant findings. The patient was taken to the operating room for surgery to remove the mass.

The gross findings of the mass were consistent with a thymoma. Thymomas are the most common type of anterior mediastinal mass. They are typically slow-growing tumors that can be benign or malignant. The most common symptoms of thymoma are chest pain, shortness of breath, and cough.

Thymomas are treated with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. The treatment depends on the size and stage of the tumor. Thymomas are usually cured with surgery. However, some patients may require chemotherapy or radiation therapy to prevent the tumor from coming back.

The other options are incorrect because they are not the most common type of anterior mediastinal mass. Teratomas are rare tumors that can develop from any germ cell. They can contain a variety of tissues, including bone, muscle, and hair. Lymphoma is a type of cancer that starts in the lymph nodes.

Explanation:

The patient in this case has a history of rheumatoid arthritis and a 50-pack-year smoking history. He was treated with definitive accelerated hypofractionated course of radiotherapy to a total of dose 60 Gy in 8 fractions. Five months after treatment, he awakened with abrupt onset of severe right shoulder pain. The pain was sharp, constant, and localized to his right scapula and ultimately progressed to the point of radiating down the extensor surface of his arm ending at his elbow. He denied paresthesias, weakness, or any inciting events that could have led to its onset. His primary care physician obtained a CT scan, followed 2 days later by a magnetic resonance image (MRI) of his right shoulder.

The CT scan showed no evidence of metastatic disease. The MRI showed increased signal intensity in the right infraspinatus and teres minor muscles, consistent with radiation-induced myositis.

Radiation-induced myositis is a common complication of thoracic radiotherapy. It is caused by damage to the muscle fibers by the ionizing radiation. The symptoms typically develop within 2-3 months of treatment and resolve within 6-12 months. The treatment is supportive, with rest, ice, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely in this case. Metastatic non–small-cell lung cancer would be more likely to present with pain that is worse at night, and there would be other signs of metastatic disease on the CT scan. Rib fracture would be more likely to be associated with trauma, and there would be tenderness and pain on palpation of the rib. Polymyalgia rheumatica is a systemic inflammatory disease that causes pain and stiffness in the muscles, but it is not associated with radiation therapy.

Explanation:

The patient's ERBB2 (HER2) status is equivocal, meaning that the result is not definitive. A score of 1+ on IHC is considered to be equivocal, and further testing is needed to determine the patient's true HER2 status. This can be done with a second IHC test, or with a more sensitive test such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).

It is important to determine the patient's HER2 status because it will affect her treatment options. Patients with HER2-positive breast cancer are typically treated with targeted therapies that block the HER2 protein. These therapies can be very effective in treating HER2-positive breast cancer, but they are not effective in treating HER2-negative breast cancer.

Explanation: The patient has a clinical picture consistent with scleroderma, a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by fibrosis of the skin and internal organs. The most common initial symptom of scleroderma is Raynaud phenomenon, which is characterized by vasospasm of the small blood vessels in the extremities in response to cold or emotional stress. Other common symptoms include skin thickening, joint pain and stiffness, and Raynaud phenomenon.

The patient in the case report has a number of features that are consistent with scleroderma, including facial swelling and periorbital edema, woody induration involving the nape of the neck and upper back, and a positive antinuclear antibody panel. A skin biopsy is the most definitive test for scleroderma. It can help to confirm the diagnosis and determine the subtype of scleroderma.

The other options are not as appropriate in this case. Option A, measuring 24-hour urine protein, is a test that can be used to screen for kidney disease. However, the patient in the case report does not have any symptoms or signs of kidney disease. Option B, obtaining a 2D echocardiogram, is a test that can be used to assess the function of the heart. However, the patient in the case report does not have any symptoms or signs of heart disease. Option D, obtaining a thoracic computed tomography scan, is a test that can be used to assess the lungs. However, the patient in the case report does not have any symptoms or signs of lung disease.

Chondrodermatitis nodularis helicis chronicus is a condition that causes inflammation and pain in the ear. It is not associated with calcification or ossification.

Relapsing polychondritis is an autoimmune disease that causes inflammation and destruction of cartilage. It can affect the ears, but it does not typically cause calcification or ossification.

Scleroderma is a connective tissue disease that causes fibrosis (thickening and hardening of the skin and other tissues). It can affect the ears, but it does not typically cause calcification or ossification.

Petrified ear is a rare condition that causes calcification and ossification of the ear cartilage. It is most commonly seen in elderly men with chronic renal failure. The patient in this case has a history of chronic renal failure, and his biopsy specimen showed regions of ossification and calcification. This is consistent with a diagnosis of petrified ear.

The other possible diagnoses are not supported by the patient's history, physical examination, or laboratory findings.

The patient in the case presented with multiple bizarrely shaped purpuric and necrotic plaques on the hands and lower limbs. Erosion was seen on the scrotum. Histopathologic images showed leukocytoclastic vasculitis. These findings are most consistent with cutaneous small vessel vasculitis.

Erythema nodosum leprosum is a skin condition that occurs in people with leprosy. It is characterized by the development of red, tender nodules on the skin, especially on the lower legs. The nodules are often painful and may ulcerate.

Lucio phenomenon is a rare, severe complication of leprosy that can occur in people with lepromatous leprosy. It is characterized by the development of necrotic skin lesions, often on the face and extremities. The lesions may ulcerate and become infected.

Cutaneous small vessel vasculitis is a type of vasculitis that affects the small blood vessels in the skin. It can cause a variety of skin lesions, including purpura, petechiae, ecchymoses, and ulcers. The lesions may be painful and may itch.

Cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa is a type of vasculitis that affects the small and medium-sized blood vessels in the skin. It can cause a variety of skin lesions, including purpura, petechiae, ecchymoses, and ulcers. The lesions may be painful and may itch.

In the case presented, the patient's skin lesions were most consistent with cutaneous small vessel vasculitis.

Explanation:
Multicentric reticulohistiocytosis (MR) is a rare, chronic, non-neoplastic disorder characterized by the proliferation of histiocytes in the skin, lymph nodes, and other organs. The most common skin findings are erythematous papules and nodules that are often arranged in a symmetric distribution on the extremities. The nodules may be tender or painful, and they may ulcerate. Other skin findings may include poikiloderma, telangiectasias, and alopecia.

MR is associated with a variety of systemic symptoms, including fever, fatigue, weight loss, and arthralgias. In some cases, MR may be associated with underlying hematologic disorders, such as monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) or Waldenström macroglobulinemia.

The diagnosis of MR is made based on the clinical presentation and the results of a skin biopsy. The biopsy shows a dense infiltrate of histiocytes in the dermis. The histiocytes have a characteristic appearance, with abundant cytoplasm and a prominent nucleus.

There is no cure for MR, but the disease can be managed with a variety of treatments, including corticosteroids, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. The prognosis for patients with MR varies depending on the extent of disease and the presence of any underlying medical conditions.

The other options are incorrect because they do not match the clinical presentation and the biopsy findings in this case. Erythema elevatum diutinum is a chronic, relapsing, inflammatory disorder characterized by the development of erythematous, papular, and nodular lesions on the extensor surfaces of the extremities. Pyoderma gangrenosum is a rare, chronic, neutrophilic dermatosis characterized by the development of painful, necrotic ulcers on the skin.

Explanation: The patient's presentation is most consistent with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), a rare but aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that arises in the central nervous system. PCNSL is typically seen in older adults, with a median age of diagnosis of 65 years. The most common presenting symptoms are headache, seizures, and focal neurological deficits. The diagnosis of PCNSL is made on the basis of a combination of clinical findings, imaging studies, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Imaging studies typically show leptomeningeal enhancement, which is the abnormal accumulation of contrast material in the meninges, the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. CSF analysis may show a lymphocytic pleocytosis, an elevation of the protein level, and a decrease in the glucose level. The definitive diagnosis of PCNSL is made by biopsy of the brain or spinal cord.

The treatment of PCNSL is typically multimodal, consisting of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and immunotherapy. The prognosis for PCNSL is poor, with a median survival of approximately 12 months. However, with aggressive treatment, some patients may achieve long-term remission.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* B. Carcinomatous meningitis–primary adenocarcinoma of the lung: Carcinomatous meningitis is a metastatic cancer of the meninges, the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. It is most commonly caused by breast cancer, lung cancer, and melanoma. The patient's presentation is not consistent with carcinomatous meningitis, as he does not have a history of cancer.
* C. Tubercular meningitis: Tubercular meningitis is an infection of the meninges caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is a common cause of meningitis in developing countries, but it is rare in developed countries. The patient's presentation is not consistent with tubercular meningitis, as he does not have any risk factors for tuberculosis and he does not have any findings on imaging studies or CSF analysis that are suggestive of tuberculosis.
* D. Neurosarcoidosis: Neurosarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect any part of the nervous system. It is most commonly seen in young adults. The patient's presentation is not consistent with neurosarcoidosis, as he does not have any findings on imaging studies or CSF analysis that are suggestive of neurosarcoidosis.

Explanation:
The patient has exudative macular detachment after a viral illness with rash. The most likely cause is acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (APMPPE). APMPPE is a self-limiting disease, and treatment is usually not necessary. However, if the macula is involved, treatment with intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections may be beneficial.

The other options are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate treatment for APMPPE. Oral prednisone therapy is not recommended for APMPPE, as it can worsen the disease. Photodynamic therapy is a treatment option for age-related macular degeneration, but it is not effective for APMPPE. Observation is not an appropriate treatment option for a patient with a macula-involving detachment, as this can lead to permanent vision loss.

In conclusion, the best treatment for the patient in this case is intravitreal anti-VEGF injections.

Explanation:

The patient is a healthy man in his 40s with an asymptomatic posterior segment tumor in his left eye. The lesion is a large cyst in the temporal peripheral retina. Cysts are common in the retina and are usually benign. They can be caused by a variety of factors, including inflammation, trauma, and infection. In most cases, cysts do not require treatment. However, if the cyst is large or if it is causing symptoms, such as blurred vision or floaters, treatment may be necessary.

In this case, the patient is asymptomatic and the lesion is small. Therefore, observation is the most appropriate course of action. The patient should be monitored regularly to ensure that the lesion does not grow or cause any problems. If the lesion does grow or cause symptoms, then treatment may be necessary.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Brachytherapy is a type of radiation therapy that is used to treat cancer. Biopsy is a procedure in which a small piece of tissue is removed from the body for examination under a microscope. Ultrasound biomicroscopy is a type of imaging test that uses sound waves to create images of the inside of the eye. These procedures are not necessary in this case because the patient is asymptomatic and the lesion is small.

A carotid cavernous fistula (CCF) is an abnormal connection between the carotid artery and the cavernous sinus. This connection can cause blood to flow from the artery into the sinus, which can lead to a variety of symptoms, including proptosis, chemosis, and visual impairment.

In the case presented, the patient has a history of trauma to the left orbit, which has resulted in an enlarged superior orbital fissure. This enlargement is likely due to a CCF. The patient's symptoms, including proptosis, chemosis, and visual impairment, are also consistent with a CCF.

The treatment for a CCF is typically surgical embolization. This procedure involves inserting a catheter into the carotid artery and then injecting a substance to block the connection between the artery and the cavernous sinus. This procedure is typically very effective in treating CCFs and can result in significant improvement in symptoms.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Conservative management would not be effective in treating a CCF and would likely result in worsening of the patient's symptoms. Trabeculectomy or drainage procedure are procedures that are used to treat glaucoma, which is not the patient's primary diagnosis.

Explanation:

The patient's presentation is most consistent with opiate-induced anamnestic recall of prior deficits. Opiates can cause a reversible state of anterograde amnesia, which can lead to a patient being unable to recall events that occurred while they were under the influence of the drug. This is what appears to have happened in this case, as the patient's alertness improved and he was able to recall his name and follow commands after receiving naloxone, which is a medication that reverses the effects of opiates. The patient's right face and hand weakness persisted, which is consistent with a prior deficit that was not apparent while he was under the influence of the opiate.

Focal seizures with postictal hemiparesis is a possible diagnosis, but it is less likely than opiate-induced anamnestic recall of prior deficits. The patient did not have a history of seizures, and there is no evidence of a focal seizure in this case. The patient's right face and hand weakness persisted, which is not typical of postictal hemiparesis.

Ischemic stroke is a possible diagnosis, but it is less likely than opiate-induced anamnestic recall of prior deficits. The patient did not have any risk factors for ischemic stroke, and there is no evidence of an ischemic stroke on the patient's magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.

Acute demyelinating disorder is a possible diagnosis, but it is less likely than opiate-induced anamnestic recall of prior deficits. The patient did not have any risk factors for an acute demyelinating disorder, and there is no evidence of an acute demyelinating disorder on the patient's MRI scan.

Explanation:

The patient is a woman in her 50s who presented with a 4-week history of a slowly enlarging mass on the left side of the neck. Physical examination revealed a mobile, nontender, 4-cm mass in the left side of the floor of mouth. A contrast-enhanced computed tomographic scan of the neck showed a 3.8-cm cystic neck mass in the left floor of mouth. An ultrasonography (US)-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy showed bland-appearing cuboidal to columnar epithelial cells arranged in clusters; no malignant cells were identified. Repeated US-guided FNA biopsy showed a hypercellular specimen composed of numerous fragments of bland-appearing cuboidal and columnar epithelium and granular debris, which was eosinophilic in cell block sections and papillary structures with fibrovascular cores. The hypercellularity was atypical, and a low-grade neoplasm could not be ruled out. At this point, the patient elected observation of the mass and a repeated biopsy. A core biopsy showed a well-differentiated papillary neoplasm with hyalinized fibrovascular cores and some degenerative changes. Immunophenotypically, the neoplastic cells were negative for the markers TTF-1, PAX-8, estrogen receptor, and thyroglobulin. These results, with the morphologic characteristics, were most consistent with a low-grade salivary neoplasm. She underwent excision of the cystic floor of mouth mass and a level I neck dissection. Pathologic examination revealed a cystic, 2.5-cm encapsulated mass arising from a minor salivary gland.

Low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma is the most common salivary gland neoplasm. It is a well-differentiated neoplasm that typically presents as a slow-growing mass. The tumor can occur in any of the major or minor salivary glands, but it is most common in the parotid gland. Low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma is usually non-aggressive and has a good prognosis. However, it can occasionally metastasize to the regional lymph nodes or lungs.

The diagnosis of low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma is based on the clinical presentation, imaging findings, and histopathologic features. The tumor is typically seen as a well-circumscribed mass on imaging studies. On histopathologic examination, the tumor is composed of a mixture of epithelial, mucinous, and squamous cell components. The epithelial cells are typically bland and non-keratinizing. The mucinous cells are present in varying amounts and can be either goblet cells or signet ring cells. The squamous cells are typically present in the form of islands or nests.

The treatment of low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma is based on the stage of the tumor. For small, superficial tumors, local excision may be curative. For larger or more advanced tumors, a combination of surgery and radiation therapy may be necessary. The prognosis for patients with low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma is generally good. The 5-year survival rate is >90%.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not the most common type of salivary gland neoplasm. Acinic cell carcinoma is the second most common salivary gland neoplasm, but it is less common than low-grade mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Warthin tumor is a benign neoplasm that is typically found in the parotid gland. Intraductal papilloma is a benign neoplasm that is typically found in the minor salivary glands.

Explanation: The most likely diagnosis is complications of otitis media. The patient has a history of otitis media and recent fevers, and on evaluation, she has a bulging, hyperemic left tympanic membrane, along with fullness of the postauricular, upper cervical region. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of acute otitis media. Complications of otitis media include mastoiditis, meningitis, and brain abscess. Mastoiditis is an infection of the mastoid air cells, which are located behind the ear. Meningitis is an infection of the meninges, which are the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord. Brain abscess is an infection of the brain tissue.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disorder characterized by the proliferation of Langerhans cells, which are a type of white blood cell. Rhabdomyosarcoma is a type of cancer that originates from muscle cells. Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that originates from the squamous cells that line the skin and mucous membranes.

The patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with a diagnosis of Langerhans cell histiocytosis, rhabdomyosarcoma, or squamous cell carcinoma. The patient's CT scan shows a bulging, hyperemic left tympanic membrane, along with fullness of the postauricular, upper cervical region.

A papillary meningioma is a rare, benign tumor of the meninges. It typically occurs in adults and is more common in women. The tumor usually arises in the cerebral hemispheres, but can also occur in the spinal cord or in the meninges around the brainstem. Papillary meningiomas are typically slow-growing tumors and are often asymptomatic. However, they can cause symptoms such as headache, seizures, and visual disturbances. Treatment for papillary meningioma typically involves surgery to remove the tumor. Radiation therapy may also be used to reduce the risk of recurrence.

A choroid plexus papilloma is a rare, benign tumor that arises from the choroid plexus, a structure in the brain that produces cerebrospinal fluid. Choroid plexus papillomas are most common in children and young adults. The tumor typically occurs in the lateral ventricles of the brain, but can also occur in the third or fourth ventricles. Choroid plexus papillomas are typically slow-growing tumors and are often asymptomatic. However, they can cause symptoms such as headache, seizures, and hydrocephalus. Treatment for choroid plexus papilloma typically involves surgery to remove the tumor. Radiation therapy may also be used to reduce the risk of recurrence.

An endolymphatic sac tumor is a rare, benign tumor that arises from the endolymphatic sac, a structure in the inner ear that helps to regulate the pressure of the endolymphatic fluid. Endolymphatic sac tumors are most common in adults over the age of 50. The tumor typically occurs in the temporal bone, but can also occur in other parts of the body. Endolymphatic sac tumors are typically slow-growing tumors and are often asymptomatic. However, they can cause symptoms such as hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, and facial paralysis. Treatment for endolymphatic sac tumor typically involves surgery to remove the tumor. Radiation therapy may also be used to reduce the risk of recurrence.

A middle ear adenoma is a rare, benign tumor that arises from the middle ear. Middle ear adenomas are most common in adults over the age of 50. The tumor typically occurs in the mucosa of the middle ear, but can also occur in other parts of the middle ear. Middle ear adenomas are typically slow-growing tumors and are often asymptomatic. However, they can cause symptoms such as hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, and facial paralysis. Treatment for middle ear adenoma typically involves surgery to remove the tumor. Radiation therapy may also be used to reduce the risk of recurrence.

In the case presented, the patient is an elderly man with long-standing discharge and hearing loss in the left ear and mild dizziness. He has no facial weakness. He is obese and has congestive heart failure and hypertension. Findings from the otolaryngologic examination were otherwise unremarkable. Advanced-stage mixed conductive and sensorineural hearing loss in the left ear were noted. Computed tomography (CT) showed a soft-tissue mass in the mastoid and middle ear cavity extending to the external ear canal with no significant erosion of ossicles. During modified radical mastoidectomy, the mastoid cavity was found to be full of edematous, fragile soft tissue with mucoid secretions. The incus was intact but dislocated. Histopathological examination revealed a polypoid lesion showing typical papillary architecture with central fibrovascular cores and dilated glandular structures, lined by a bland-looking single layer of high columnar/cuboidal epithelial cells. No mitotic activity or necrosis was detected. The richly vascularized fibrotic stroma consisted of cholesterol clefts, foamy macrophages, lymphocytes, and eosinophils, reminiscent of inflammatory granulation tissue. The epithelial cells were positive for cytokeratin-7 (CK7), CK19, epithelial membrane antigen, and glial fibrillary acidic protein. Ki-67 immunostain showed a proliferation index of less than 1%.

Based on the information presented, the most likely diagnosis is a middle ear adenoma. The patient's age, the location of the tumor, and the histopathological findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of middle ear adenoma. The other possible diagnoses are less likely based on the information presented.

Explanation:
The patient in this case has a history of anosmia, or loss of smell, that has been present for years. She also has a history of minor trauma to her nose, which could have damaged the olfactory nerves. The physical examination revealed a clinically significant hump on the dorsum of the nose, which is consistent with prior trauma. The flexible fiber-optic examination of the nose revealed no masses, polyps, or cysts, which suggests that the anosmia is not caused by a blockage in the nasal passages. The magnetic resonance image of the anterior skull base demonstrated absent olfactory sulci and bilateral olfactory grooves containing minimal tissue. This finding is consistent with olfactory nerve damage, which is the most likely cause of the patient's anosmia.

Cerebrospinal fluid leak is a rare condition in which cerebrospinal fluid leaks from the brain into the nasal passages. This can cause a number of symptoms, including headache, nausea, and vomiting. However, it is not typically associated with anosmia.

Sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect multiple organs, including the lungs, skin, and eyes. It is not typically associated with anosmia.

Explanation:
The most likely diagnosis is thyroglossal duct fistula. Thyroglossal duct fistulas are congenital anomalies that result from incomplete obliteration of the thyroglossal duct during embryogenesis. The thyroglossal duct is a temporary structure that connects the base of the tongue to the thyroid gland. In most cases, the thyroglossal duct obliterates completely during the first trimester of pregnancy. However, in some cases, it may persist and form a fistula.

Thyroglossal duct fistulas typically present as a small opening in the midline of the neck, just below the hyoid bone. The opening may discharge a small amount of saliva or pus. The fistula may also be associated with a mass in the neck.

The diagnosis of thyroglossal duct fistula is usually made based on the history and physical examination. Imaging studies, such as ultrasonography or computed tomography (CT), may be used to confirm the diagnosis and to assess the extent of the fistula.

Treatment of thyroglossal duct fistula is surgical excision. The fistula is excised along with the tract that connects it to the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland is not removed unless it is also involved in the infection.

The prognosis for patients with thyroglossal duct fistula is excellent. With prompt diagnosis and treatment, the fistula can be cured with minimal risk of recurrence.

Branchial cleft fistulas are another type of congenital anomaly that can present with a chronic draining sinus in the neck. However, branchial cleft fistulas are much less common than thyroglossal duct fistulas. Branchial cleft fistulas typically present in early childhood, and they are more common in girls than boys.

Nonhealing surgical tracts are also a possible cause of a chronic draining sinus in the neck. However, nonhealing surgical tracts are usually associated with a history of recent surgery in the neck. In this case, the patient has a history of multiple previous attempts at surgical resection of the fistula, without success.

Nocardia infection is a rare cause of a chronic draining sinus in the neck. Nocardia infection is more common in immunocompromised patients. In this case, the patient does not have any risk factors for Nocardia infection.

Takayasu arteritis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the aorta and its major branches. It is most common in young women, and the exact cause is unknown. The disease can cause narrowing or blockage of the arteries, which can lead to a variety of symptoms, including lower extremity pain, claudication, hypertension, and heart failure.

The patient in this case presents with several features that are consistent with Takayasu arteritis. She is a young woman, and she has a history of progressive lower extremity pain that is relieved with rest. She also has a mildly elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which is a non-specific marker of inflammation. The magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis shows mild stenosis of bilateral subclavian arteries and an abnormal-appearing infrarenal aorta. These findings are consistent with Takayasu arteritis.

The other options are incorrect. Middle aortic syndrome is a rare condition that is characterized by narrowing of the aorta in the middle portion of the body. Inflammatory aneurysm is a condition in which an aneurysm, or bulge in the wall of an artery, develops due to inflammation. Giant cell arteritis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the large and medium-sized arteries that is most common in people over the age of 50.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for the patient in this case is Takayasu arteritis. This is a chronic inflammatory disease of the aorta and its major branches that is most common in young women. The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are all consistent with this diagnosis.

Explanation:

The patient is a previously healthy, African American man in his mid-60s with a history of hepatitis C cirrhosis (compensated) who presented to the emergency department after collapsing at work with sudden-onset back and abdominal pain. He was hypotensive (blood pressure, 87/55 mm Hg) on arrival to the emergency department. The patient’s condition was rapidly stabilized and computed tomography with contrast demonstrated a large (12.4 × 10.2-cm) right hepatic mass with heterogeneous enhancement on arterial phase and intrahepatic and intraperitoneal hemorrhage. Emergency angiography was performed by interventional radiology, demonstrating active contrast extravasation originating from the right hepatic artery. Embolization was performed with Gelfoam and microparticles, resulting in hemodynamic stability and a quick recovery. Delayed liver resection was subsequently performed.

The most likely diagnosis is a ruptured giant cavernous hemangioma. Cavernous hemangiomas are the most common type of benign liver tumor, accounting for approximately 70% of all liver tumors. They are typically asymptomatic and are discovered incidentally on imaging studies. However, they can rupture, causing acute abdominal pain, hypotension, and shock. Ruptured cavernous hemangiomas are more common in women than men, and they are more likely to occur in patients with underlying liver disease, such as cirrhosis.

The diagnosis of a ruptured cavernous hemangioma is made on the basis of clinical presentation, imaging studies, and angiography. On imaging studies, cavernous hemangiomas typically appear as well-defined, lobulated masses with a heterogeneous appearance due to the presence of blood and clot. Angiography may demonstrate active contrast extravasation from the tumor.

The treatment of a ruptured cavernous hemangioma is surgical resection. This is usually performed laparoscopically. The goal of surgery is to remove the tumor and control the bleeding. The prognosis for patients with a ruptured cavernous hemangioma is generally good, with most patients making a full recovery.

The other possible diagnoses are not as likely in this case. A complex cystic liver mass is more likely to be a simple cyst or a cystic neoplasm, such as a liver abscess or a cystadenoma. Hepatocellular carcinoma is more likely to occur in patients with underlying liver disease, such as cirrhosis. Spontaneous liver bleeding is a rare condition that is more likely to occur in patients with underlying liver disease, such as cirrhosis.

If the mutation is not harmful, then ibrutinib may be a safe and effective treatment for the patient. However, if the mutation is harmful, then ibrutinib may not be effective in treating the patient and may even make the patient's condition worse. Therefore, it is important to discuss the risks and benefits of ibrutinib with the patient before making a decision about whether or not to use it.

The other answers are incorrect because they are based on assumptions that are not supported by the evidence. Answer A assumes that the CARD11 mutation is associated with ibrutinib resistance. However, this is not known for certain. Answer B assumes that the CARD11 mutation is found only in a subclonal population. However, this is also not known for certain. Answer D assumes that the significance of the amino acid exchange in CARD11 is a variant of known significance. However, this is also not known for certain.

The patient has a history of metabolic syndrome, which is a cluster of risk factors that increase the risk of heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes. One of the risk factors for metabolic syndrome is high blood sugar. High blood sugar can damage blood vessels, including the blood vessels in the retina. Damage to the retina can cause blurry vision.

Hemoglobin A1c is a test that measures the average amount of sugar in the blood over the past 2-3 months. A high hemoglobin A1c level indicates that the patient has had high blood sugar for a long time. This is important information to know, because it can help the doctor determine the best way to treat the patient's metabolic syndrome and prevent further damage to the retina.

The other answers are incorrect because they do not address the patient's underlying condition of metabolic syndrome. B. Evaluate for hypercoagulable disorders is incorrect because there is no evidence in the patient's history or physical examination to suggest that he has a hypercoagulable disorder. C. Order carotid ultrasound is incorrect because the patient's blurry vision is not likely due to a problem with the carotid arteries. D. Order magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is incorrect because the patient's blurry vision is not likely due to a problem with the brain.

Explanation: The elevated testosterone level is consistent with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). PCOS is a common endocrine disorder characterized by irregular menstrual cycles, excess androgen production, and polycystic ovaries. The diagnosis of PCOS is based on the presence of two of the following three criteria:

* Oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea
* Hyperandrogenism (clinical or biochemical)
* Polycystic ovaries on ultrasound

In this case, the patient has oligomenorrhea, hyperandrogenism (elevated testosterone level), and a normal fasting glucose level. The normal fasting glucose level excludes abnormal glucose tolerance, which is a common finding in PCOS. The normal luteinizing hormone-to-follicle-stimulating hormone ratio is not specific for PCOS and can be seen in other conditions, such as hypothyroidism. Therefore, the elevated testosterone level is the most consistent finding with PCOS in this case.

Explanation:

This patient has a number of risk factors for hyperkalemia, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and a recent myocardial infarction. He is also taking several medications that can increase serum potassium levels, including lisinopril, metoprolol succinate, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The patient's symptoms of weakness are consistent with hyperkalemia. His electrocardiogram shows peaked T waves and widened QRS complexes, which are also consistent with hyperkalemia. The patient's laboratory results show a serum potassium level of 6.5 mEq/L, which is significantly elevated. These findings suggest that the patient's hyperkalemia is likely due to the medications he is taking.

Excessive potassium intake is unlikely to be the cause of the patient's hyperkalemia, as he is not taking any potassium supplements and his diet is not high in potassium-rich foods. Pseudohyperkalemia is also unlikely, as the patient's electrocardiogram shows changes consistent with hyperkalemia. Transcellular potassium shift is also unlikely, as the patient does not have any conditions that would cause this, such as acidosis or alkalosis.

Therefore, the most likely cause of the patient's hyperkalemia is the medications he is taking.

 79%|███████▉  | 1208/1525 [4:36:09<1:00:28, 11.45s/it]The correct answer is **Bullous pemphigoid**.

Bullous pemphigoid is a chronic autoimmune blistering disease characterized by the formation of subepidermal blisters. It is the most common autoimmune blistering disease in adults. The blisters are typically tense and flaccid, and they may be associated with pain, itching, and burning. The most common areas affected are the hands, feet, trunk, and groin.

The cause of bullous pemphigoid is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disease. In autoimmune diseases, the body's immune system mistakenly attacks its own tissues. In the case of bullous pemphigoid, the immune system attacks the proteins that hold the skin cells together. This leads to the formation of blisters.

The diagnosis of bullous pemphigoid is made based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. A skin biopsy is often performed to confirm the diagnosis.

The treatment of bullous pemphigoid is aimed at suppressing the immune system. This is typically done with corticosteroids, such as prednisone. In severe cases, other immunosuppressive medications may be necessary.

The prognosis for bullous pemphigoid is generally good. With treatment, most patients will experience a significant improvement in their symptoms. However, the disease can be chronic, and it may recur.

Explanation of why the other answers are incorrect:

* **Bullous amyloidosis** is a rare, autoimmune disorder characterized by the deposition of amyloid protein in the skin. It can cause a variety of skin lesions, including blisters, papules, and nodules. However, the blisters in bullous amyloidosis are typically firm and non-fluctuant, and they are not associated with the other features seen in this case.
* **Herpes simplex infection** is a common viral infection that can cause blisters on the skin. The blisters in herpes simplex infection are typically small and grouped together. They are also often associated with fever, headache, and lymphadenopathy.
* **Cutaneous candidiasis** is a fungal infection of the skin. It can cause a variety of skin lesions, including blisters, papules, and plaques. However, the blisters in cutaneous candidiasis are typically small and superficial. They are also often associated with itching and redness.

Explanation:

The patient is a man in his early 40s with a medical history significant for verruca vulgaris, dyshidrotic eczema, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) diagnosed 1 year prior to presentation. He reports a 1-month history of “puffy and bumpy” lips. On physical examination, there are several erythematous papules at the vermillion border of the lower lip within a background of edema. In addition, the patient has slight fissuring of the tongue, but the remainder of the oral mucosa is normal and intact. His CD4 count is within normal limits (520 cells/µL) and HIV viral load is undetectable. A biopsy was performed on the right lower lip, which showed a nodular, nonnecrotizing granulomatous dermatitis.

Oral sarcoidosis is a chronic granulomatous disease that can affect any part of the oral cavity, including the lips. It is more common in patients with HIV infection. The most common symptoms of oral sarcoidosis are swelling of the lips, gums, and tongue; ulcerations of the oral mucosa; and white patches on the tongue. The diagnosis of oral sarcoidosis is made based on the clinical presentation, biopsy findings, and exclusion of other possible causes. Treatment for oral sarcoidosis is aimed at controlling the inflammation and preventing complications. This may include oral corticosteroids, topical steroids, or other medications.

The other possible diagnoses are not as likely in this patient. Postherpetic granulomatous reaction is a rare complication of herpes zoster infection that can cause inflammation and granuloma formation in the skin and mucous membranes. It is more common in older adults and people with weakened immune systems. The patient in this case is not an older adult and does not have a weakened immune system. Crohn disease is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease that can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, including the mouth. It is not associated with oral sarcoidosis. Granulomatous cheilitis is a rare inflammatory condition of the lips that can cause swelling, redness, and pain. It is not associated with HIV infection.

Explanation:

Muir-Torre syndrome is a rare, inherited cancer predisposition syndrome characterized by multiple sebaceous gland tumors and a predisposition to internal malignancies, most commonly colorectal cancer. The diagnosis of Muir-Torre syndrome is based on the presence of at least one sebaceous gland tumor and one internal malignancy, or at least three sebaceous gland tumors in the absence of an internal malignancy.

The patient in this case presents with a rapidly growing, painful nodule on her upper cutaneous lip, as well as several smaller papules on her face and neck. She also has a family history of cancer, including melanoma and colon cancer. These findings are consistent with Muir-Torre syndrome.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not adequately explain the patient's presentation. Cowden syndrome is a rare, inherited disorder characterized by multiple hamartomas (benign tumors) of the skin, mucous membranes, and other organs. It is not associated with an increased risk of internal malignancies. Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome is a rare, inherited disorder characterized by multiple benign tumors of the hair follicles, skin, and mucous membranes. It is not associated with an increased risk of internal malignancies. Basal cell nevus syndrome is a rare, inherited disorder characterized by multiple basal cell carcinomas (the most common type of skin cancer).

Explanation:
The patient has optic nerve atrophy and hair loss. These are two of the classic symptoms of vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 is essential for the proper function of the nervous system and red blood cells. A deficiency can lead to a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, weakness, numbness, tingling, and vision problems.

Smoking can also contribute to vitamin B12 deficiency. This is because smoking can damage the lining of the small intestine, which makes it difficult to absorb vitamin B12 from food.

Therefore, the next step in the evaluation of this patient should be to check his vitamin B12 levels and ask about his smoking history. If he is found to be deficient in vitamin B12, he can be treated with injections of the vitamin. Treatment usually results in rapid improvement in symptoms.

A, B, and D are incorrect because they do not address the patient's specific symptoms. Mitochondrial optic neuropathies are a rare group of genetic disorders that can cause optic nerve atrophy. However, they are not typically associated with hair loss. Checking blood and urine for heavy metals is a test that is used to screen for exposure to toxins such as lead and mercury. These toxins can cause a variety of health problems, including optic nerve atrophy, but they are not typically associated with hair loss. Rule out an underlying neoplastic process is a general statement that does not provide any specific information about the patient's condition. It is important to remember that there are many possible causes of optic nerve atrophy, and it is important to rule out all possible causes before making a diagnosis.

The patient's presentation is consistent with giant cell arteritis (GCA), a systemic vasculitis that can affect the temporal arteries. GCA is a relatively rare condition, but it is more common in older adults, especially women. The classic presentation of GCA is headache, scalp tenderness, and jaw claudication. However, up to 20% of patients with GCA do not have these classic symptoms. The most common ocular manifestation of GCA is anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION), which can lead to sudden, painless vision loss.

The patient's history of nonprogressive diminished vision in his left eye for 6 weeks is concerning for AION. The presence of elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels supports the diagnosis of GCA. Antinuclear antibody (ANA) testing is positive in up to 60% of patients with GCA. However, ANA testing is not specific for GCA, and it can be positive in other autoimmune diseases.

The next step in the management of this patient is to refer him for a rheumatologic workup. The rheumatologist will likely order additional laboratory tests, such as a temporal artery biopsy, to confirm the diagnosis of GCA. If the diagnosis of GCA is confirmed, the patient will be treated with high-dose corticosteroids. Treatment with corticosteroids is usually effective in reversing the visual loss caused by AION.

The other options are incorrect because they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's vision loss. Option A (proceed with temporal artery biopsy) is incorrect because the diagnosis of GCA can be made without a temporal artery biopsy. Option B (refer patient to primary care physician for management of his hypertension) is incorrect because the patient's hypertension is not the cause of his vision loss. Option D (observe and reevaluate in 2 months) is incorrect because the patient's vision loss is likely to progress if it is not treated.

Explanation:
The patient presents with a complex clinical picture, including stomatitis, cutaneous bullae, and renal failure. The most likely diagnosis is pemphigus vulgaris, an autoimmune blistering disease that affects the skin and mucous membranes. Pemphigus vulgaris is characterized by the formation of flaccid blisters that rupture easily, leaving behind painful erosions. The lesions are often located on the oral mucosa, but they can also occur on the skin, particularly the scalp, face, and trunk. Pemphigus vulgaris is a potentially life-threatening condition, and it is important to make the diagnosis as early as possible so that treatment can be initiated.

The diagnosis of pemphigus vulgaris is confirmed by skin biopsy. Immunofluorescence testing is used to detect the presence of antibodies against desmoglein 1 and desmoglein 3, which are proteins that are essential for the adhesion of skin cells. Treatment for pemphigus vulgaris is aimed at suppressing the immune system. This is usually done with a combination of oral corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive medications. In some cases, plasmapheresis may also be used. With treatment, most patients with pemphigus vulgaris can achieve remission. However, the disease can be unpredictable, and relapses are common.

The other options are not correct because they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's condition. Oral acyclovir is an antiviral medication that is used to treat herpes simplex virus infections. It would not be effective in treating pemphigus vulgaris, which is an autoimmune disease. Renal biopsy is a procedure that is used to obtain a sample of kidney tissue for diagnostic purposes. It would not be helpful in the management of pemphigus vulgaris. Oral corticosteroids are immunosuppressive medications that can be used to treat pemphigus vulgaris. However, they are not the first-line treatment, and they should be used with caution in patients with renal failure.

Explanation:

The most likely diagnosis is cutaneous fungal infection, specifically candidiasis. This is supported by the following findings:

* The patient is a premature neonate, who are at increased risk for cutaneous fungal infections.
* The lesion is a 0.5-cm, circular, crusted papule with a surrounding rim of erythema. This is a typical presentation of candidiasis.
* The biopsy specimen revealed epidermal necrosis with fungal elements within the superficial dermis. This is diagnostic of candidiasis.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely. Pressure ulcers are unlikely because the patient is a neonate and does not have any underlying conditions that would predispose him to pressure ulcers. Neonatal lupus erythematosus is unlikely because the patient's mother does not have systemic lupus erythematosus, and the patient does not have any other features of neonatal lupus erythematosus.

**Explanation:** The patient's presentation is consistent with vanishing bile duct syndrome associated with Hodgkin lymphoma. Vanishing bile duct syndrome is a rare disorder characterized by the destruction of bile ducts in the liver. This can lead to jaundice, pruritus, and weight loss. The patient in this case presented with all of these symptoms.

In addition, the patient's physical examination revealed a large right supraclavicular lymph node conglomerate. This is a common finding in Hodgkin lymphoma. The patient's laboratory evaluation also showed a total serum bilirubin level of 10.5 mg/dL with a direct component of 8.4 mg/dL. This is consistent with obstructive jaundice, which is a common complication of vanishing bile duct syndrome.

The patient's liver biopsy showed a portal tract containing both hepatic artery and hepatic vein branches. This is a characteristic finding of vanishing bile duct syndrome.

The other possible diagnoses are not consistent with the patient's presentation. Acute hepatitis associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection is typically a self-limited illness that does not cause jaundice or weight loss. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem disorder that can cause lymphadenopathy, but it does not typically cause jaundice or weight loss. Metastatic cholangiocarcinoma secondary to primary sclerosing cholangitis is a rare cancer that typically occurs in older adults. It is not a common cause of jaundice in young adults.

The patient's history of a Merkel cell carcinoma of the left knee, which was excised 19 months prior, is significant. Merkel cell carcinomas are rare, aggressive tumors that are often metastatic at the time of diagnosis. The patient's gastric mass is located in the same location as the Merkel cell carcinoma, and it shows intense 68Ga–DOTATOC uptake, which is a characteristic of Merkel cell carcinoma metastases. The other answer choices are less likely because they do not explain the patient's history and imaging findings.

Gastric adenocarcinoma is the most common type of gastric cancer, but it is unlikely in this case because the patient does not have any risk factors for gastric adenocarcinoma, such as chronic gastritis or Helicobacter pylori infection. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are rare tumors that can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract. They are often metastatic at the time of diagnosis, but they are not typically associated with Merkel cell carcinoma. Type III neuroendocrine tumors of the stomach are also rare tumors that can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract. They are not typically associated with Merkel cell carcinoma.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is gastric metastasis of Merkel cell carcinoma.

Explanation:

The patient is a 40-year-old man with a history of a painless mass in the pancreas that was found incidentally on CT scan. He also has a family history of pancreatic carcinoma. The physical examination and laboratory values are normal. The CT scan shows a 10 × 10 × 8-cm mass in the tail of the pancreas.

The differential diagnosis for a mass in the pancreas includes pancreatic carcinoma, cystic neoplasms, and inflammatory lesions. Pancreatic carcinoma is the most common malignancy of the pancreas and is usually associated with weight loss, abdominal pain, and jaundice. Cystic neoplasms can be benign or malignant. Benign cystic neoplasms include cystadenoma and serous cystadenoma. Malignant cystic neoplasms include mucinous cystadenocarcinoma and intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN). Inflammatory lesions of the pancreas include pancreatitis and pseudocysts.

The patient's age, lack of weight loss, and normal laboratory values are more suggestive of a benign lesion. The family history of pancreatic carcinoma is concerning for a malignant lesion, but the patient's age is relatively young for pancreatic carcinoma. The CT scan shows a mass that is well-defined and does not have the features of a malignant lesion, such as necrosis or invasion of adjacent structures.

The most likely diagnosis is cystadenoma. Cystadenomas are benign cystic neoplasms that are composed of epithelial cells. They are usually solitary and can occur in any part of the pancreas. Cystadenomas can be asymptomatic or can present with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. The diagnosis is made on CT scan or MRI. Treatment is surgical excision.

The other options are less likely. Pancreatic carcinoma is a malignant neoplasm that is composed of epithelial cells. It is the most common malignancy of the pancreas and is usually associated with weight loss, abdominal pain, and jaundice. The diagnosis is made on CT scan or MRI. Treatment is surgical resection, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.

Hydatid cyst of the pancreas is a parasitic infection that is caused by the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus. It is a rare condition that is usually seen in people who live in areas where sheep are raised. The diagnosis is made on CT scan or MRI. Treatment is surgical excision.

Main duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasia (IPMN) is a precancerous condition of the pancreas. It is usually seen in people who are older than 50 years old. The diagnosis is made on CT scan or MRI. Treatment is surgical resection.

Explanation: The patient's history of an ovarian cyst treated conservatively, and cosmetic breast augmentation, are both risk factors for breast cancer. The patient's 10 pack-year smoking history is a risk factor for lung cancer. The patient's cardiac symptoms, including intermittent epigastric pain, palpitations, and hot flashes, are consistent with metastatic cardiac disease. The patient's echocardiogram demonstrated a mass in the left ventricular myocardium, which is a common finding in metastatic cardiac disease. The cardiac magnetic resonance imaging revealed multiple intramyocardial masses involving the left ventricle, the largest of which measured 2.7 × 2.2 cm; aortopulmonary window lymphadenopathy; and moderate pericardial effusion. These findings are also consistent with metastatic cardiac disease. The computed tomographic imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis with contrast failed to reveal discrete masses or lymphadenopathy elsewhere. This suggests that the patient's cardiac masses are metastatic from a primary tumor that is located elsewhere in the body. The transcutaneous biopsy of the left ventricular mass was nondiagnostic. This means that the biopsy was unable to determine the type of cancer that is causing the patient's cardiac masses. Based on the patient's history, physical examination, laboratory findings, imaging studies, and biopsy results, the most likely diagnosis is metastatic carcinoma.

The patient in this case has a history of breast cancer and is currently receiving trastuzumab treatment. Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that targets and kills cancer cells that express the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). However, trastuzumab can also cause a number of side effects, including a rash. The rash in this case is generalized, nonpruritic, and nontender, which are all characteristic of a drug-induced rash. The patient also has pancytopenia, which is a decrease in the number of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. Pancytopenia can be a side effect of trastuzumab, but it can also be a sign of a more serious condition, such as a blood infection or a bone marrow disorder.

In order to determine the cause of the patient's rash and pancytopenia, it is important to perform a screening test for syphilis. Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection that can cause a rash, fever, and lymphadenopathy. It can also cause a number of serious complications, such as neurological problems, heart disease, and blindness. If the patient is found to have syphilis, it can be treated with antibiotics.

The other options are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate next steps in the management of this patient. Option A, discontinuing trastuzumab, is not the best option because the rash may be a side effect of trastuzumab, but it may also be a sign of a more serious condition. Option B, obtaining a skin biopsy, is not the best option because the rash is not suspicious for cancer. Option C, prescribing topical steroids, is not the best option because the rash may not be caused by an allergic reaction.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a foreign body reaction to the red ink in her tattoo. The white blood cell count is mildly elevated, which is a non-specific finding that can be seen with a variety of inflammatory conditions. A punch biopsy of the lesion is the most appropriate next step to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible causes, such as infection or an allergic reaction. Oral antibiotics or higher-potency topical steroids are not indicated at this time, as they are unlikely to be effective in treating a foreign body reaction. Reassurance and follow-up in 2 weeks would be appropriate if the patient's symptoms were mild and there was no evidence of infection or other complications.

The patient's PSA level has been slowly rising over the past few years, but it is still within the normal range. His DRE revealed an enlarged prostate without nodules, which is also consistent with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). BPH is a noncancerous condition that causes the prostate to enlarge, which can lead to symptoms such as urinary frequency, urgency, and difficulty urinating.

The patient's age and race are also risk factors for prostate cancer. However, he has no family history of the disease, and his PSA level is not high enough to warrant a biopsy. Therefore, the most likely explanation for his symptoms is BPH.

The probability of prostate cancer in a man with a PSA level of 4.1 to 10 ng/mL is approximately 10%. However, this probability increases with age and other risk factors. In this case, the patient's age and race are risk factors for prostate cancer, but his PSA level is not high enough to warrant a biopsy. Therefore, the probability of prostate cancer in this patient is less than 10%.

The other answers are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Answer B: The patient’s rise in PSA level means his probability of prostate cancer is more than 50%. This is incorrect because the patient's PSA level is still within the normal range.
* Answer C: The patient’s probability of prostate cancer is approximately 6% for a high-grade cancer and 18% for a low-grade cancer. This is incorrect because the patient's PSA level is not high enough to warrant a biopsy.
* Answer D: Variability in the patient’s PSA level makes it likely the tests were done in different laboratories. This is incorrect because the patient's PSA level has been slowly rising over the past few years.

The patient's history, physical examination, and resting ECG are all unremarkable. However, the exercise treadmill test shows significant ST depressions during recovery. This is a concerning finding, as it is a sign of ischemia (reduced blood flow to the heart muscle). Ischemia can be caused by a number of things, including coronary artery disease (CAD).

CAD is a condition in which the arteries that supply blood to the heart become narrowed or blocked. This can lead to chest pain, heart attack, or even death. The inferolateral ST depressions seen on the patient's exercise treadmill test are suggestive of CAD involving the right coronary artery, the left circumflex artery, or both arteries.

Further testing is needed to confirm the diagnosis of CAD and to determine the extent of the disease. This may include coronary angiography, which is a procedure that uses X-rays to visualize the arteries that supply blood to the heart.

If the patient is found to have CAD, treatment will be aimed at reducing the risk of heart attack or death. This may include lifestyle changes, such as quitting smoking, eating a healthy diet, and exercising regularly. In some cases, medication or surgery may also be necessary.

The other answers are incorrect because they do not take into account the patient's exercise treadmill test results. Answer A is incorrect because the patient is not asymptomatic, as he has chest pain. Answer B is incorrect because ST depressions are significant even if they are less than 2 mm. Answer C is incorrect because the patient's ST depressions are in the inferolateral leads, which are indicative of CAD.

Explanation:

Trichodysplasia spinulosa–associated polyomavirus (TSKPV) is a recently described human polyomavirus that causes a rare, chronic, and progressive skin disorder characterized by follicular papules and hyperkeratosis. The disorder is typically seen in adults with immunosuppression, such as those with HIV/AIDS or hematologic malignancies.

The patient in this case presents with a history of polycythemia vera and acute myelogenous leukemia, both of which are hematologic malignancies. She also reports a 2½-year history of sandpapery skin changes on her face, neck, chest, and forearms. These findings are consistent with TSKPV infection.

Histopathologic examination of the patient's skin biopsy specimens revealed perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates, as well as viral particles within the epithelial cells of the hair follicles. These findings are also consistent with TSKPV infection.

There is no specific treatment for TSKPV infection. However, the disorder can be managed with topical corticosteroids and oral retinoids. In some cases, surgical excision of affected skin may be necessary.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not describe the patient's clinical presentation or histopathologic findings.

* **Demodex folliculorum–associated spinulosus** is a condition caused by the Demodex folliculorum mite. It is characterized by follicular papules and pustules on the face and scalp.
* **Ulerythema ophryogenes** is a rare, chronic, and progressive skin disorder characterized by follicular papules and hyperkeratosis of the eyebrows and eyelashes.
* **Hyperkeratotic spicules of multiple myeloma** is a rare, paraneoplastic skin condition that occurs in patients with multiple myeloma. It is characterized by hyperkeratotic spicules on the palms and soles.

Ecthyma gangrenosum is a skin infection caused by the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It is characterized by painful, ulcerated lesions that often have a grayish membrane over them. The lesions are most commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, such as those with diabetes or cancer. Treatment typically involves antibiotics, such as ceftazidime or ciprofloxacin.

The other possible answers are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Cutaneous tuberculosis is a skin infection caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is characterized by a variety of skin lesions, including papules, nodules, and ulcers. The lesions are often non-tender and may not have a grayish membrane. Treatment typically involves antibiotics, such as isoniazid and rifampin.
* Leishmaniasis is a parasitic infection caused by the protozoan Leishmania. It is characterized by skin lesions that may be ulcerated or nodular. The lesions are often accompanied by fever, lymphadenopathy, and weight loss. Treatment typically involves anti-leishmanial drugs, such as pentavalent antimony or miltefosine.
* Cutaneous diphtheria is a skin infection caused by the bacterium Corynebacterium diphtheriae. It is characterized by a grayish membrane that covers the skin lesions. The lesions are often painful and may have a foul odor. Treatment typically involves antibiotics, such as penicillin or erythromycin.

Explanation:
The patient's clinical presentation is most consistent with Hurler-Scheie syndrome, a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of alpha-L-iduronidase. Characteristic features of the syndrome include coarse facial features, hepatomegaly, distinctive lumbar kyphosis, and muscular hypotonia. The skin lesions described in the case are also consistent with Hurler-Scheie syndrome, as they are known to occur in up to 80% of patients with the disorder.

Child abuse is an unlikely diagnosis in this case, as there is no evidence of trauma on physical examination or in the history. Morquio syndrome is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase. Characteristic features of the syndrome include skeletal dysplasia, corneal clouding, and aortic valve regurgitation. GM1 gangliosidosis is a lysosomal storage disorder caused by a deficiency of beta-galactosidase. Characteristic features of the syndrome include hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, and seizures.

In conclusion, the patient's clinical presentation is most consistent with Hurler-Scheie syndrome.

The patient is a woman in her 50s with a history of renal transplant 12 years earlier. She presents with a 1-month history of gait unsteadiness and imbalance, followed by 2 successive transient episodes of acute dizziness, disorientation, gait dysfunction, and confusion. On examination, she has gait ataxia and mild memory deficits.

The patient's imaging studies show multiple ring-enhancing lesions in the brain, with the most prominent lesions in the right parietal lobe and splenium of the corpus callosum. These findings are most consistent with central nervous system lymphoma.

The patient's laboratory studies are also consistent with central nervous system lymphoma. The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) white blood cell count is elevated, with a predominance of lymphocytes. The CSF protein level is also elevated. These findings suggest inflammation of the brain, which is a common finding in central nervous system lymphoma.

The patient's treatment will likely include a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The prognosis for patients with central nervous system lymphoma is variable, but with treatment, the majority of patients can expect to survive for several years.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely in this patient. Central nervous system toxoplasmosis is a parasitic infection that can cause brain lesions. However, the patient's history and imaging studies are not consistent with toxoplasmosis. Metastatic carcinoma is the spread of cancer from another part of the body to the brain. However, the patient does not have a history of cancer, and her imaging studies are not consistent with metastatic carcinoma. Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder is a type of cancer that can develop in patients who have received an organ transplant. However, the patient's imaging studies are not consistent with posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder.

The patient has a history of monocular nystagmus and failure to thrive. He is also emaciated. These findings are concerning for a mass lesion in the central nervous system (CNS), such as a tumor. MRI is the most sensitive and specific imaging modality for detecting CNS lesions. It can also provide information about the size, location, and type of lesion. This information is important for planning treatment.

Electrooculography (EOG) and visual evoked potential (VEP) tests are useful for evaluating the function of the visual system. However, they are not as sensitive as MRI for detecting CNS lesions. Blood culture is useful for diagnosing infections. However, it is not likely to be helpful in this case, as the patient does not have any symptoms of infection.

Therefore, the next step in the evaluation of this patient should be to perform an MRI of the brain and spine.

The patient has a choroidal granuloma involving the macula, which is a rare but serious complication of tuberculosis. The most common treatment for this condition is oral prednisone, but the patient in this case is intolerant of corticosteroids. Therefore, the next step in management is to consult an infectious diseases specialist to discuss alternative antitubercular therapy.

Corticosteroid-sparing immunosuppressive therapy (B) is an option for patients who are intolerant of corticosteroids, but it is not the first-line treatment. Intravitreous triamcinolone acetonide (C) is a corticosteroid injection that can be used to treat choroidal granulomas, but it is not as effective as oral prednisone. Pars plana vitrectomy with intravitreous methotrexate (D) is a surgical procedure that is used to treat choroidal granulomas, but it is only used in patients who have failed other treatments.

In conclusion, the best next step in management for this patient is to consult an infectious diseases specialist to discuss alternative antitubercular therapy.

Explanation: Orf is a contagious viral disease of sheep and goats that can be transmitted to humans through contact with infected animals or their fomites (e.g., contaminated wool, hair, or straw). The disease is characterized by the development of a single, raised, red nodule on the skin that may become ulcerated and crusted. The lesions are usually painless and self-limited, resolving within 2-4 weeks.

In the case presented, the patient is a healthy young girl who lives on a farm and has extensive direct contact with sheep and cows. She reports recently injuring her hand on a metal fence at home and biting her nails frequently. She presents with a 4-week history of a painless, enlarging lesion on her right thumb that started as a small erythematous blister. The lesion is now 1 × 1.5 cm in size, well-defined, and eroded with central crusting and an erythematous border. There are several slightly enlarged, mildly tender lymph nodes noted in the right axilla. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of orf.

Herpetic whitlow is a viral infection caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). It is characterized by the development of a painful, vesicular eruption on the fingers or hands. The lesions are usually multiple and may be accompanied by fever, lymphadenopathy, and malaise.

Cutaneous anthrax is a bacterial infection caused by Bacillus anthracis. It is characterized by the development of a black eschar at the site of infection. The eschar may be surrounded by erythema and edema. The patient may also have fever, chills, headache, and malaise.

Sporotrichosis is a fungal infection caused by Sporothrix schenckii. It is characterized by the development of a single, raised, red nodule on the skin that may become ulcerated and crusted. The lesions are usually painless and self-limited, resolving within 2-4 weeks. However, in some cases, the infection can spread to other parts of the body, such as the lymph nodes, lungs, and central nervous system.

In conclusion, the patient in the case presented is most likely to have orf. This diagnosis is supported by the patient's history of contact with sheep and goats, the location of the lesion on the thumb, and the appearance of the lesion (single, raised, red nodule that is ulcerated and crusted).

Explanation:

A true vocal fold polyp is a benign mass that arises from the epithelium of the vocal fold. It is usually caused by chronic vocal abuse, such as shouting or singing. Symptoms include hoarseness, breathiness, and pain. Treatment is usually surgical removal.

Vocal fold squamous cell carcinoma is a malignant tumor that arises from the epithelium of the vocal fold. It is the most common type of cancer of the larynx. Symptoms include hoarseness, pain, and a lump in the neck. Treatment is usually surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.

True vocal fold myxoma is a benign tumor that arises from the connective tissue of the vocal fold. It is the second most common type of tumor of the vocal fold. Symptoms include hoarseness, breathiness, and pain. Treatment is usually surgical removal.

Thyroarytenoid muscle rhabdomyoma is a rare, benign tumor that arises from the muscle of the vocal fold. It is usually found in children. Symptoms include hoarseness, breathiness, and pain. Treatment is usually surgical removal.

In this case, the patient has a submucosal mass in the anterior two-thirds of the right true vocal fold. The mass is firm, submucosal, tan-colored, seemingly encapsulated, and multilobulated. It is deep to the epithelium of the true vocal fold and superficial to the vocal ligament. These findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of true vocal fold myxoma.

True vocal fold polyps are usually smooth and pedunculated, while true vocal fold myxomas are usually firm and multilobulated. True vocal fold squamous cell carcinomas are usually irregular and ulcerated, while true vocal fold myxomas are usually smooth and intact. Thyroarytenoid muscle rhabdomyomas are usually found in children, while true vocal fold myxomas can be found in people of all ages.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is true vocal fold myxoma.

An angiofibroma is a benign tumor that arises from the blood vessels and connective tissue of the nose and nasopharynx. It is most common in adolescent boys and is typically associated with hormonal changes. Angiofibromas can cause nasal obstruction, epistaxis, and headaches. Treatment is usually surgical removal.

The patient in this case is a woman in her 70s who presents with a 4-day history of new-onset, left-sided acute epistaxis. She denies other sinonasal symptoms, history of epistaxis, nasal trauma, or surgery. Clinical evaluation reveals a soft-tissue mass filling the left nasal cavity and based on the mucosal surface of the anterolateral nasal vestibule. Noncontrast paranasal sinus computed tomography shows a 1.2 × 0.8-cm ovoid soft-tissue mass opacifying the posterior aspect of the left nasal vestibule. Endoscopic excision under local anesthesia was performed to remove a broad-based soft-tissue mass from the left nasal vestibule mucosa with a cuff of grossly healthy submucosa. A tissue specimen was biopsied and showed features consistent with an angiofibroma.

The patient had an uneventful postoperative course, and her epistaxis symptoms were resolved at the 5-month follow-up.

The other options are incorrect because they are not typically associated with epistaxis in elderly women. Angiomyolipomas are benign tumors that arise from the smooth muscle, blood vessels, and fat cells. They are most common in the kidney, but can also occur in the liver, spleen, and other organs. Angioleiomyomas are benign tumors that arise from the smooth muscle of blood vessels. They are most common in the skin and subcutaneous tissue, but can also occur in other organs, including the nose. Hemangiomas are benign tumors that arise from the blood vessels. They are most common in children, but can occur at any age.

Inverted papilloma is a benign tumor that arises from the Schneiderian membrane, which lines the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. It is the most common neoplasm of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. Fungal ball is a mass of fungal hyphae that can form in the sinuses. It is usually caused by aspergillosis, but other fungi can also cause it. Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma is a rare, aggressive type of cancer that can arise from the nasal cavity or paranasal sinuses.

The patient in the case presented with dizziness, vomiting, unstable gait, and headaches. These symptoms are consistent with hyponatremia, which is a low level of sodium in the blood. Hyponatremia can be caused by a number of conditions, including SIADH. SIADH is a condition in which the body produces too much antidiuretic hormone (ADH). ADH is a hormone that helps the body to retain water. When too much ADH is produced, it can lead to hyponatremia.

The patient in the case also had a 2.5 × 1.5 × 1.8-cm mass in the superior right maxillary sinus with extension into the infundibulum. This mass was found on MRI and CT scans. The mass was also biopsied, and the results showed that it was a small, round, blue-cell tumor. This type of tumor is characteristic of esthesioneuroblastoma.

Esthesioneuroblastoma is a rare tumor that accounts for less than 1% of all head and neck cancers. It is typically diagnosed in adults between the ages of 20 and 40. The tumor most commonly arises in the olfactory bulb, which is located at the base of the nose. It can also spread to the nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, and other parts of the head and neck.

The treatment for esthesioneuroblastoma depends on the stage of the disease. In early-stage disease, the tumor can be treated with surgery and radiation therapy. In more advanced disease, chemotherapy may also be used. The prognosis for esthesioneuroblastoma is generally good, with a 5-year survival rate of over 80% for patients with early-stage disease.

The other options are incorrect because they are not consistent with the patient's presentation and the results of the biopsy. Inverted papilloma is a benign tumor that typically presents with nasal obstruction and discharge. Fungal ball is a mass of fungal hyphae that can form in the sinuses. It is usually caused by aspergillosis, but other fungi can also cause it.

Explanation:
The patient is a woman in her 60s with a history of breast cancer and a recent history of an oral cavity lesion. She presents with a 3-week history of enlarging and painful cervical masses. She does not have any known tuberculosis exposure, recent foreign travel, exposure to unpasteurized food, history of immunodeficiency, or alcohol or tobacco use. She does not have fever, chills, cough, dysphagia, or odynophagia. Physical examination reveals bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, which includes fixed and bulky nodes in level IB and IIA and nontender level IV and V nodes. An oral cavity examination reveals no evidence of masses or lesions, floor of mouth and base of tongue are soft, and the palatine tonsils had no lesions or ulcers. Flexible laryngoscopy revealed no evidence of pharyngeal or laryngeal lesions. Contrast-enhanced computed tomographic (CT) scans of the neck revealed bilateral lymphadenopathy with central necrosis.

The most likely diagnosis is lymphoma. This is supported by the patient's history of breast cancer, which is a known risk factor for lymphoma. The patient's presentation with bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy, which includes fixed and bulky nodes in level IB and IIA, is also consistent with lymphoma. The CT scan findings of bilateral lymphadenopathy with central necrosis are also consistent with lymphoma.

Squamous cell carcinoma is a less likely diagnosis. This is because the patient does not have any risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma, such as smoking or exposure to tobacco smoke. The patient's presentation with bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy is also not typical for squamous cell carcinoma.

Tuberculous lymphadenitis is a less likely diagnosis. This is because the patient does not have any risk factors for tuberculosis, such as recent foreign travel or exposure to an infected person. The patient's presentation with bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy is also not typical for tuberculosis.

Papillary thyroid carcinoma is a less likely diagnosis. This is because the patient does not have any risk factors for papillary thyroid carcinoma, such as a family history of thyroid cancer. The patient's presentation with bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy is also not typical for papillary thyroid carcinoma.

Explanation: The patient is a woman in her 70s with a history of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and right-sided chronic otitis media. She presents with a 2-month history of a dry cough, foreign body sensation in the throat, and mild dysphagia. On examination, there is a submucosal pulsatile mass in the right retropharyngeal area. Head and neck magnetic resonance angiography shows an aberrant internal carotid artery in the retropharyngeal space.

An aberrant internal carotid artery is a congenital anomaly in which the internal carotid artery arises from the common carotid artery and courses aberrantly through the retropharyngeal space. This anomaly is usually asymptomatic, but it can cause symptoms such as pulsatile tinnitus, neck pain, and dysphagia. The diagnosis is made with imaging studies such as magnetic resonance angiography or computed tomography angiography. Treatment is usually not required, but surgery may be necessary in some cases.

Arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) are abnormal connections between arteries and veins. They can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the brain. AVMs can cause symptoms such as seizures, headaches, and bleeding. The diagnosis is made with imaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography. Treatment is usually not required, but surgery may be necessary in some cases.

Cavernous hemangiomas are benign tumors that are made up of blood vessels. They can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the skin and liver. Cavernous hemangiomas are usually asymptomatic, but they can cause symptoms such as pain, bleeding, and disfigurement. The diagnosis is made with imaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography. Treatment is usually not required, but surgery may be necessary in some cases.

Internal carotid artery pseudoaneurysms are saccular outpouchings of the internal carotid artery wall. They can occur as a result of trauma, infection, or atherosclerosis. Pseudoaneurysms can cause symptoms such as headache, neck pain, and pulsatile tinnitus. The diagnosis is made with imaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography. Treatment is usually surgical.

In this case, the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging studies are most consistent with a diagnosis of aberrant internal carotid artery. The patient's age and history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus are risk factors for this anomaly. The submucosal pulsatile mass in the right retropharyngeal area is characteristic of an aberrant internal carotid artery. The head and neck magnetic resonance angiography shows an aberrant internal carotid artery in the retropharyngeal space. These findings make the diagnosis of aberrant internal carotid artery highly likely.

The other answers are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Neurosarcoid is a rare disease that causes inflammation of the central nervous system. It is not a common cause of brain tumors.
* Hypophysitis is an inflammation of the pituitary gland. It can cause symptoms such as headaches, fatigue, and vision problems, but it is not a common cause of brain tumors.
* Pituitary macroadenoma is a type of tumor that can grow on the pituitary gland. It can cause symptoms such as headaches, vision problems, and changes in hormone levels, but it is not a common cause of brain tumors.

In conclusion, the patient's history, symptoms, and imaging findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of melanoma metastasis.

Explanation: The patient has a painful anal mass that appeared 1 year earlier and grew slowly to the current size. He reports bleeding from the rectum after defecation and denies weight loss or fever. The physical examination reveals a 12 × 10-cm hard mass on the left side of the anus that is ulcerated, covered by purulent exudate, and very painful. The scrotum is mildly tender to palpation. Digital rectal examination and rectoscopy were not performed because of the pain and fecal incontinence. The abdomen is soft and nontender. Routine blood, liver, and renal function test results were normal, as were results for carcinoembryonic antigen and cancer antigen 19-9. Chest radiography showed no abnormalities. Computed tomographic scan of the pelvis showed a hypodense 12 × 7 × 3-cm mass extending to the anus, anal canal, and lower perirectal space. Abdominal computed tomography showed no pathology.

The most likely diagnosis is giant perianal abscess. This is a rare condition that is characterized by a large, painful abscess in the perianal region. The abscess is usually caused by an infection of the anal glands. The patient's history, physical examination, and imaging findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of giant perianal abscess.

Giant condyloma is a sexually transmitted disease that is caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). The lesions are usually small, cauliflower-like growths that can occur anywhere on the skin, including the perianal region. The patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with a diagnosis of giant condyloma.

Anal adenocarcinoma is a type of cancer that starts in the cells that line the anus. The patient's history, physical examination, and imaging findings are not consistent with a diagnosis of anal adenocarcinoma.

Explanation:
Gossypiboma is a rare condition that occurs when a foreign body, typically a piece of gauze, is left inside the body during surgery. The foreign body can become embedded in the tissue, causing inflammation and infection. In the case of a gossypiboma in the liver, the patient may present with abdominal pain, fever, and jaundice. Imaging studies, such as CT scan or MRI, can help to diagnose the condition. Treatment typically involves surgical removal of the foreign body.

In the case of the patient described in the question, the history of a splenectomy and hepatic biopsy nine years earlier is significant. It is possible that a piece of gauze was left behind during the surgery, and that this has now become embedded in the liver. The patient's symptoms, including abdominal pain, fever, and jaundice, are also consistent with a diagnosis of gossypiboma. Imaging studies, such as CT scan or MRI, would be helpful in confirming the diagnosis. Treatment would then involve surgical removal of the foreign body.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Hepatocellular carcinoma is a type of liver cancer. It is the most common type of liver cancer in adults. The patient in the question does not have any of the risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma, such as chronic hepatitis B or C infection, cirrhosis of the liver, or alcohol abuse.
* Fibrolamellar carcinoma is a rare type of liver cancer. It is typically seen in young women. The patient in the question is not a young woman, and she does not have any of the risk factors for fibrolamellar carcinoma.
* Hepatic metastasis is the spread of cancer from another part of the body to the liver. The patient in the question does not have any history of cancer, and she does not have any of the symptoms that are typically associated with hepatic metastasis.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is gossypiboma.

The patient has a history of pulmonary sarcoidosis, and the rash could be a sign of progression of the disease. A chest radiograph is the best way to assess the lungs for signs of inflammation or fibrosis.

Discontinuation of pantoprazole is not necessary at this time. The rash is not likely due to the pantoprazole, and there is no evidence that it is causing any harm.

Starting oral prednisone is a possible treatment for sarcoidosis, but it is not the first-line treatment. Prednisone is a powerful steroid that can have serious side effects, so it is only used if other treatments are not effective.

Testing for anti–Mi-2 and anti–Jo-1 antibodies is not necessary at this time. These antibodies are associated with autoimmune diseases such as polymyositis and dermatomyositis, but the patient does not have any symptoms of these diseases.

The patient presents with a number of symptoms consistent with hyperprolactinemia, including fatigue, vision loss, and low libido. He also has a history of taking sertraline, which is known to cause hyperprolactinemia. However, his examination is significant for the presence of bitemporal visual field defects, which suggests that the hyperprolactinemia is caused by a prolactinoma. Prolactinomas are the most common type of pituitary adenoma, and they are typically benign tumors that secrete prolactin. The elevated serum prolactin levels in this patient support the diagnosis of a prolactinoma.

The other possible answers are incorrect. Option A is incorrect because the patient does not have any symptoms or signs of a nonfunctioning pituitary adenoma. Option B is incorrect because the patient does not have any symptoms or signs of thyroid disease. Option C is incorrect because the patient's hyperprolactinemia is not likely to be caused by sertraline, as he has been taking the medication for several years and his symptoms have only recently developed.

In conclusion, the patient has hyperprolactinemia due to a prolactinoma. This diagnosis is supported by the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory tests.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of morphea, a chronic autoimmune disease that causes fibrosis of the skin and other organs. Laboratory studies for antinuclear, anti-Scl-70, and anti-centromere antibodies are helpful in confirming the diagnosis of morphea.

Obtaining a detailed procedural history is not necessary in this case because the patient does not have a history of trauma or recent surgery. Patch testing for a possible contact allergen is not necessary in this case because the patient does not have any other cutaneous findings that are suggestive of a contact dermatitis. Obtaining a skin swab for varicella zoster virus direct fluorescent antibody level is not necessary in this case because the patient does not have any of the characteristic findings of varicella zoster virus infection, such as vesicles or bullae.

Here are some additional details about morphea:

* Morphea is a rare autoimmune disease that affects the skin and other organs.
* The most common form of morphea is localized scleroderma, which affects the skin only.
* Morphea can also affect the muscles, bones, and internal organs.
* The cause of morphea is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disease.
* There is no cure for morphea, but there are treatments that can help to control the symptoms.
* Treatment for morphea typically involves the use of corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, or radiation therapy.
* The outlook for patients with morphea varies depending on the severity of the disease.

 81%|████████▏ | 1241/1525 [4:43:51<1:02:45, 13.26s/it]Answer: C. Vasculitis
Explanation:
The patient in the case has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease, and coronary artery disease. She developed severe, unremitting left ankle pain with purpuric lesions on the skin. She had previously undergone coronary artery bypass grafting with simultaneous aortic valve replacement and ileal conduit urinary diversion as a result of to recurrent upper urinary tract infections. Laboratory findings were significant for neutrophil-predominant leukocytosis. Physical examination revealed multiple stellate, purpuric plaques with central flaccid bullae on the medial and lateral aspects of the left ankle. The remainder of her skin examination findings were unremarkable. Punch biopsy specimens were obtained along the border of normal and lesional skin, and she underwent transesophageal echocardiography.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is vasculitis. Vasculitis is a condition that occurs when the blood vessels become inflamed. This inflammation can damage the blood vessels and lead to a variety of symptoms, including purpura (purple spots on the skin), pain, and swelling.

There are many different types of vasculitis, and the specific type of vasculitis that a person has will depend on the blood vessels that are involved. In this case, the patient's vasculitis is likely involving the small blood vessels in the skin. This is because the patient has multiple stellate, purpuric plaques with central flaccid bullae on the medial and lateral aspects of the left ankle. These lesions are characteristic of small vessel vasculitis.

The patient's history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, end-stage renal disease, and coronary artery disease are all risk factors for vasculitis. These conditions can damage the blood vessels and make them more susceptible to inflammation.

The patient's laboratory findings are also consistent with vasculitis. The patient has neutrophil-predominant leukocytosis, which is a sign of inflammation.

The patient's transesophageal echocardiography was normal, which means that she does not have septic emboli. Septic emboli are small pieces of infected material that travel through the bloodstream and lodge in the blood vessels. They can cause inflammation and damage to the blood vessels, which can lead to purpura, pain, and swelling.

Necrotizing fasciitis is a serious infection of the skin and subcutaneous tissue that can lead to death. It is caused by bacteria that enter the skin through a break in the skin, such as a cut or a scrape. Necrotizing fasciitis is characterized by rapid progression of the infection, severe pain, and swelling. The patient in the case does not have these symptoms, so necrotizing fasciitis is not the most likely diagnosis.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis in this case is vasculitis. The patient's history, physical examination, laboratory findings, and imaging studies are all consistent with vasculitis.

 81%|████████▏ | 1242/1525 [4:44:07<1:06:45, 14.16s/it]Answer: A. Discoid lupus erythematosus
Explanation:
The patient is a man in his 50s of Indian descent who presented with a pruritic eruption on his scalp, arms, neck, and feet. The eruption began during the summer 3 months before presentation. His medical history was significant for type 2 diabetes mellitus and hypertension, which were managed with metformin, glimepiride, and atenolol.
Physical examination revealed hyperpigmented annular plaques with violaceous borders on his scalp and the superior part of his forehead. There were violaceous papules on the dorsal aspect of the hands, extensor surface of the arms, and the nape of the neck.
A punch biopsy specimen was obtained and sent for histopathologic evaluation. The histopathologic findings showed a lymphocytic infiltrate at the dermoepidermal junction, consistent with discoid lupus erythematosus.
Discoid lupus erythematosus is a chronic, autoimmune skin disease that primarily affects women of childbearing age. It is characterized by the formation of well-demarcated, erythematous, scaly plaques with follicular plugging. The lesions are often photosensitive, meaning they worsen with sun exposure. Discoid lupus erythematosus can also affect the mucous membranes, eyes, and kidneys.
The diagnosis of discoid lupus erythematosus is based on the clinical presentation, histopathologic findings, and serologic testing. The treatment of discoid lupus erythematosus is aimed at reducing inflammation and preventing scarring. Topical steroids are the first-line treatment, but systemic steroids may be necessary for severe cases. Other treatments include phototherapy, oral retinoids, and immunosuppressive agents.
The prognosis of discoid lupus erythematosus is generally good. However, the disease can be chronic and relapsing. In some cases, it can progress to systemic lupus erythematosus, a more serious autoimmune disease that can affect multiple organs.
The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not match the clinical presentation of the patient. Erythema dyschromicum perstans is a chronic, papular skin condition that is characterized by the formation of hyperpigmented or hypopigmented macules. Lichen planus actinicus is a photosensitive skin condition that is characterized by the formation of violaceous papules on sun-exposed areas. Polymorphous light eruption is a common, self-limiting skin condition that is characterized by the formation of papules, plaques, and vesicles on sun-exposed areas.

Explanation:

The patient is a woman in her 40s with a medical history of pulmonary embolism and deep venous thrombosis who presented with a 6-month history of pruritic, pink scaling plaques on her face and neck. The lesions subsequently involved her chest, abdomen, and back and flared with sun exposure. A diagnosis of lupus erythematosus (LE) was favored, but the lesions failed to improve on a regimen that included hydroxychloroquine sulfate, fluocinonide ointment, 0.05%, and tacrolimus ointment, 0.1%. Biopsy samples were obtained for histopathologic evaluation.

The histopathologic findings showed subepidermal blister formation with acantholysis, which is characteristic of pemphigus erythematosus. Pemphigus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease that causes blisters to form on the skin and mucous membranes. It is closely related to lupus erythematosus, but it is not a form of lupus. The most common symptom of pemphigus erythematosus is blisters on the skin, but it can also cause blisters in the mouth and throat. The blisters are usually painful and can be very difficult to heal. There is no cure for pemphigus erythematosus, but it can be treated with medications that suppress the immune system.

The other possible diagnoses are not consistent with the patient's history and presentation. Lupus erythematosus is a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect the skin, joints, kidneys, and other organs. It is characterized by a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, fever, joint pain, and a butterfly rash on the face. Eczematous dermatitis is a chronic skin condition that causes itching, redness, and inflammation of the skin. It can affect any part of the body, but it is most common on the hands, feet, and arms. Pemphigus foliaceus is an autoimmune disease that causes blisters to form on the skin. It is closely related to pemphigus vulgaris, but it is less severe.

The patient's history and presentation are most consistent with a diagnosis of pemphigus erythematosus. The histopathologic findings confirm the diagnosis. The other possible diagnoses are not consistent with the patient's history and presentation.

The patient has a history of HIV infection and is currently receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy. He has also been experiencing increasing fatigue and intermittent fevers. These symptoms are consistent with immune reactivation syndrome, which is a common complication of HIV infection. Immune reactivation syndrome can cause a variety of ocular manifestations, including vitritis, retinal whitening, and optic nerve inflammation.

The patient's initial treatment with intravenous acyclovir and prednisone was not effective. This suggests that the patient's ocular inflammation is not due to herpes simplex virus infection, which is the most common cause of vitritis in HIV-positive patients. The next step in the patient's management is to check his laboratory results to rule out other possible causes of his ocular inflammation, such as toxoplasmosis, syphilis, or cytomegalovirus infection. If the laboratory results are negative, the patient should be started on intravenous penicillin G, which is the treatment of choice for bacterial endophthalmitis.

Option A, continuing the same treatment, is incorrect because the patient's condition did not improve with initial treatment. Option B, increasing the dose of the corticosteroids, is incorrect because this would not be effective against a bacterial infection. Option D, vitreous tap/biopsy, is incorrect because this is not necessary in the initial management of a patient with vitritis.

 82%|████████▏ | 1245/1525 [4:44:52<1:07:52, 14.54s/it]The answer is B: Obtain magnetic resonance imaging of the brain.

The patient's history and physical examination findings are consistent with multiple sclerosis (MS), a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). MS is a chronic, progressive disease that can cause a variety of symptoms, including vision loss, paresthesias, and weakness. The diagnosis of MS is based on a combination of clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most sensitive and specific imaging test for MS. MRI can detect lesions in the CNS that are characteristic of MS. These lesions can be seen in the white matter of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.

In the case of the patient described in the question, the most likely next step in the evaluation is to obtain an MRI of the brain. This will help to confirm the diagnosis of MS and to assess the extent of the disease. Treatment for MS is aimed at reducing the frequency and severity of relapses, and at preventing or delaying the progression of disability. There is no cure for MS, but treatment can help to improve the quality of life for people with the disease.

A: Initiate high-dose corticosteroid therapy is not the most likely next step in the evaluation of this patient. Corticosteroids are a type of medication that can be used to reduce inflammation. However, they are not the first-line treatment for MS. In general, corticosteroids are only used to treat acute relapses of MS.

C: Perform a retinal biopsy is not the most likely next step in the evaluation of this patient. A retinal biopsy is a surgical procedure that involves removing a small piece of tissue from the retina. This procedure is usually only performed to diagnose a specific retinal disease. In the case of the patient described in the question, there is no evidence of a specific retinal disease.

D: Obtain computed tomography of the chest is not the most likely next step in the evaluation of this patient. Computed tomography (CT) is a type of imaging test that uses X-rays to create cross-sectional images of the body. CT can be used to detect a variety of medical conditions, including tumors, infections, and injuries. However, CT is not the most sensitive or specific imaging test for MS.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is most consistent with parvovirus B19 infection. The classic rash of parvovirus B19 is a "slapped cheek" rash, which is an erythematous, macular rash on the cheeks that spares the perioral area. The rash may also be widespread, and may be described as reticular or lacy. The rash is often associated with fever, malaise, and arthralgias.

Parvovirus B19 is a common viral infection that is spread through contact with respiratory secretions or blood. It is most common in children, but can occur at any age. The infection is usually mild and self-limited, but can be serious in certain groups, such as pregnant women and people with certain chronic medical conditions.

The diagnosis of parvovirus B19 infection is usually made based on the clinical presentation and the presence of specific antibodies in the blood. Treatment is supportive, and there is no specific antiviral treatment.

Adenovirus is a virus that can cause a variety of respiratory illnesses, including pharyngitis, pneumonia, and acute respiratory distress syndrome. It can also cause conjunctivitis, diarrhea, and rash. The rash of adenovirus infection is typically maculopapular, and may be associated with fever.

Ehrlichiosis is a tick-borne illness caused by bacteria of the genus Ehrlichia. The most common form of ehrlichiosis in the United States is human monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME), which is caused by Ehrlichia chaffeensis. HME typically presents with fever, headache, muscle aches, and fatigue. A rash may also be present, and is often described as maculopapular or petechial.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a virus that can cause a variety of illnesses, including infectious mononucleosis, Burkitt lymphoma, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. EBV infection can also cause a rash, which is typically described as maculopapular or petechial.

The patient's presentation is not consistent with adenovirus, ehrlichiosis, or EBV infection. The rash of adenovirus infection is typically maculopapular, and may be associated with fever. The rash of ehrlichiosis is often described as maculopapular or petechial. The rash of EBV infection is typically described as maculopapular or petechial. The patient's rash is most consistent with the rash of parvovirus B19 infection, which is a "slapped cheek" rash that is an erythematous, macular rash on the cheeks that spares the perioral area.

 82%|████████▏ | 1247/1525 [4:45:22<1:08:37, 14.81s/it]The correct answer is: A. Parosteal osteosarcoma.

Explanation:

Parosteal osteosarcoma is a rare, low-grade malignant tumor of bone that arises from the parosteal surface of bone. It is most common in the metaphyses of long bones, but it can also occur in the mandible. The tumor is typically slow-growing and painless, and it often presents as a painless mass. The diagnosis is made on the basis of imaging studies, such as CT or MRI, and biopsy. Treatment consists of surgical resection of the tumor, followed by radiation therapy. The prognosis for patients with parosteal osteosarcoma is good, with a 5-year survival rate of over 80%.

The other options are incorrect because they are not consistent with the clinical presentation and imaging findings in this case. Peripheral ossifying fibroma is a benign tumor of bone that typically presents as a painless mass in the mandible. Periosteal osteosarcoma is a rare, high-grade malignant tumor of bone that arises from the periosteum of bone. Sarcomatoid carcinoma is a rare, aggressive form of carcinoma that can metastasize to bone.

In this case, the patient is a woman in her 60s with a large, left-sided, progressively enlarging mandibular mass. She has no pain or neurosensory disturbances related to the lesion, but she does have difficulty tolerating a regular diet owing to the bulk of the mass. She has no significant medical history, but she did smoke cigarettes for 20 years. The physical examination reveals a 4.9-cm exophytic, nodular, slightly mobile mass of the left lower posterior alveolar ridge, involving the buccal and lingual gingiva. Teeth 20 to 24 are mobile. There is no cervical lymphadenopathy. Previous biopsy demonstrated squamous mucosa with ulceration and chronic inflammation. Contrasted computed tomography reveals an exophytic complex mass with areas of calcification and ossification inferiorly and a necrotic, cystic irregularly enhancing portion superiorly. An additional biopsy was performed. The mass was excised, and teeth 20 to 26 were removed. The alveolar ridge was recontoured, and the incision was closed primarily.

The imaging findings are consistent with a malignant tumor of bone. The most likely diagnosis is parosteal osteosarcoma. This is supported by the patient's age, the location of the tumor, the clinical presentation, and the imaging findings. Peripheral ossifying fibroma is a less likely diagnosis because it is typically a benign tumor that presents as a painless mass in the mandible. Periosteal osteosarcoma is a rare, high-grade malignant tumor of bone that arises from the periosteum of bone. Sarcomatoid carcinoma is a rare, aggressive form of carcinoma that can metastasize to bone. These tumors are less likely to present as a large, exophytic mass with areas of calcification and ossification.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis in this case is parosteal osteosarcoma.

Explanation:

The patient in the case presented with a 4-year history of intermittent left-sided throat pain, which eventually progressed to left ear pain approximately 1 year prior to her presentation. She had not experienced any dysphagia, dysphonia, dyspnea, fevers, or weight loss. She had no significant use of tobacco or alcohol in the past. Findings from an otoscopic examination was unremarkable. Nasopharyngoscopy was performed and failed to reveal any masses, ulcerations, or mucosal lesions. A magnetic resonance image (MRI) revealed an enhancing 1 × 6-mm lesion in the left side of the posterolateral tongue base. A biopsy of the mass revealed an intermediate-grade infiltrating neoplasm forming solid sheets and glandular structures. The tumor cells stained positive for CK7 and p63, and negative for CK20, p16, and S-100 by immunohistochemical analysis. Stain for mucicarmine was positive in glandular areas.

Based on the information provided, the most likely diagnosis is mucoepidermoid carcinoma. Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a rare, low- to intermediate-grade salivary gland carcinoma that can occur in any of the major salivary glands, including the parotid, submandibular, and sublingual glands. It is the most common type of salivary gland carcinoma in children and young adults.

The tumor is typically composed of a mixture of three cell types: squamous cells, glandular cells, and mucin-producing cells. The tumor cells stain positive for CK7 and p63, and negative for CK20, p16, and S-100 by immunohistochemical analysis. Stain for mucicarmine is positive in glandular areas.

The treatment for mucoepidermoid carcinoma depends on the stage of the tumor. Early-stage tumors can be treated with surgery alone, while more advanced tumors may require radiation therapy or chemotherapy. The prognosis for patients with mucoepidermoid carcinoma is generally good, with a 5-year survival rate of over 80%.

The other options are incorrect because they do not match the clinical presentation and histopathologic findings of the patient in the case. Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of head and neck cancer, but it is not typically associated with a history of intermittent throat pain. Acinic cell carcinoma is a type of salivary gland carcinoma that is typically seen in older adults. Adenoid cystic carcinoma is a type of salivary gland carcinoma that is typically seen in middle-aged adults.

 82%|████████▏ | 1249/1525 [4:45:55<1:12:13, 15.70s/it]The correct answer is: D. Invasive necrotizing fungal gingivitis.

Invasive necrotizing fungal gingivitis (INFG) is a rare, life-threatening fungal infection of the oral mucosa. It is most commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, such as those with leukemia. The infection is caused by a variety of fungi, including Candida albicans, Aspergillus spp., and Mucor spp.

The initial presentation of INFG is usually with fever, pain, and swelling of the gums. The gums may become necrotic and ulcerated, and there may be a foul-smelling discharge. The infection can spread to the underlying bone, causing osteomyelitis.

INFG is diagnosed based on clinical findings and laboratory testing. A biopsy of the affected tissue is usually performed to confirm the diagnosis and identify the causative organism.

Treatment of INFG is with antifungal medications. The choice of medication depends on the infecting organism. In severe cases, surgery may be necessary to remove necrotic tissue.

The prognosis for patients with INFG is variable. With prompt diagnosis and treatment, most patients recover. However, the infection can be fatal, particularly in immunocompromised patients.

The other possible answers are incorrect because they do not fit the clinical presentation of the patient. Viral infections, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV), are more common in immunocompetent patients. Malignant neoplasms, such as squamous cell carcinoma, would not typically cause rapid progression of necrotic lesions. Pemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune disorder that causes blisters in the skin and mucous membranes. It would not be expected to cause the patient's symptoms.

Explanation:

The patient is a man in his 20s with a painless, gradually increasing swelling in the right side of the neck of 6 years’ duration. There was no history of dysphagia, hoarseness of voice, dyspnea, or constitutional symptoms, such as fever, weight loss, or night sweats. Clinical examination revealed a 7 × 6-cm, well-defined, firm, nontender swelling extending from the angle of the mandible to the clavicle. Oropharyngeal examination revealed a mucosal bulge on the lateral pharyngeal wall with normal overlying mucosa. A computed tomographic (CT) scan of the neck was performed, which revealed a solid 7 × 8 × 10-cm right carotid space mass, with a few cystic areas and coarse specks of calcification within. It showed heterogeneous postcontrast enhancement, predominantly around the calcific foci. It extended from the C2 to D1 vertebral level and displaced the right common carotid artery and internal jugular vein anterolaterally. Fat planes around the mass were well maintained, and there was no bone destruction. No cervical lymphadenopathy was noted. A biopsy was performed from the mass.

The histopathologic findings showed a spindle cell neoplasm with areas of myxoid change and focal calcification. The tumor cells were positive for S100 protein and negative for CD34, CD45, and epithelial membrane antigen. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of ancient schwannoma.

Ancient schwannoma is a rare, benign neoplasm of Schwann cells. It is typically seen in older adults, with a mean age of presentation of 60 years. The most common presentation is a painless, slowly growing mass in the head or neck. The diagnosis is made by histopathologic examination, which shows a spindle cell neoplasm with areas of myxoid change and focal calcification. The tumor cells are positive for S100 protein and negative for CD34, CD45, and epithelial membrane antigen.

The treatment of ancient schwannoma is surgical excision. The prognosis is excellent, with long-term recurrence rates of less than 5%.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not fit the patient's clinical presentation and histopathologic findings.

* Extraskeletal chondrosarcoma is a malignant neoplasm of cartilage cells. It is typically seen in adults, with a mean age of presentation of 40 years. The most common presentation is a painless, slowly growing mass in the extremities. The diagnosis is made by histopathologic examination, which shows a lobulated mass of hyaline cartilage. The tumor cells are positive for S100 protein and negative for CD34, CD45, and epithelial membrane antigen.

* Malignant fibrous histiocytoma is a malignant neoplasm of mesenchymal cells. It is typically seen in adults, with a mean age of presentation of 50 years. The most common presentation is a painless, rapidly growing mass in the extremities. The diagnosis is made by histopathologic examination, which shows a pleomorphic spindle cell neoplasm with areas of necrosis and hemorrhage. The tumor cells are positive for CD34 and negative for S100 protein.

* Synovial sarcoma is a malignant neoplasm of synovial cells. It is typically seen in young adults, with a mean age of presentation of 25 years. The most common presentation is a painless, rapidly growing mass in the extremities.

The patient's history of myelodysplastic syndrome that transformed into acute myeloid leukemia four months prior, as well as his recent treatment with experimental drug CPX-351, are significant risk factors for leukemia relapse. The patient's presentation with blurred vision in his left eye, as well as the findings of bilateral hypopyon and iris surface hemorrhages on slitlamp examination, are consistent with a diagnosis of leukemia relapse.

Endogenous endophthalmitis is a rare, sight-threatening infection of the eye that occurs when bacteria or fungi enter the bloodstream and travel to the eye. HLA-B27 uveitis is a type of uveitis that is associated with the HLA-B27 gene. Herpes simplex uveitis is a type of uveitis that is caused by the herpes simplex virus. These conditions are all possible diagnoses in the patient, but they are less likely than leukemia relapse given the patient's history and presentation.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is leukemia relapse. The patient should be referred to an oncologist for further evaluation and treatment.

A choledochoduodenal fistula is an abnormal connection between the common bile duct and the duodenum. It is a rare condition that can occur as a result of inflammation, infection, or trauma. Symptoms of a choledochoduodenal fistula may include abdominal pain, jaundice, and fever. Treatment typically involves surgery to close the fistula.

A biloma is a collection of bile that has leaked out of the liver or gallbladder. It can occur as a result of trauma, infection, or surgery. Symptoms of a biloma may include abdominal pain, fever, and jaundice. Treatment typically involves drainage of the biloma.

Choledochal cyst is a congenital abnormality of the bile duct. It is a rare condition that occurs in approximately 1 in 10,000 people. Symptoms of choledochal cyst may include abdominal pain, jaundice, and pancreatitis. Treatment typically involves surgery to remove the cyst.

A long common biliopancreatic channel is a congenital abnormality of the bile and pancreatic ducts. It is a rare condition that occurs in approximately 1 in 10,000 people. Symptoms of a long common biliopancreatic channel may include abdominal pain, jaundice, and pancreatitis. Treatment typically involves surgery to separate the bile and pancreatic ducts.

In the case described, the patient has a history of recurrent biliary colic and is currently experiencing symptoms consistent with mild gallstone pancreatitis. An abdominal ultrasonography scan demonstrates gallstones and a mildly dilated common bile duct. Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen confirms these results and reveals cholelithiasis. The patient consequently underwent urgent laparoscopic cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiography. Intraoperative cholangiography revealed an unusual anatomical variant and subsequent transcystic choledochoscopy was performed, which demonstrated a double lumen at the distal CBD. Multiple gallstones were found within a dilated region of cystic duct.

The most likely diagnosis is gallbladder duplication with double cystic duct. This is supported by the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging findings. The patient has a history of recurrent biliary colic, which is a common symptom of gallbladder disease. The physical examination findings are consistent with gallstone pancreatitis. The imaging findings demonstrate gallstones and a dilated common bile duct, which are both consistent with gallbladder disease. The intraoperative cholangiography revealed an unusual anatomical variant, which is consistent with gallbladder duplication. The transcystic choledochoscopy demonstrated a double lumen at the distal CBD, which is further evidence of gallbladder duplication.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely. Choledochoduodenal fistula is a rare condition that is not typically associated with a history of biliary colic. Biloma is a collection of bile that has leaked out of the liver or gallbladder. It is a possible diagnosis in this case, but the patient's history and physical examination findings are not consistent with this diagnosis. Choledochal cyst is a congenital abnormality of the bile duct. It is a rare condition that is not typically associated with a history of biliary colic. Long common biliopancreatic channel is a congenital abnormality of the bile and pancreatic ducts. It is a rare condition that is not typically associated with a history of biliary colic.

**Explanation:** The patient's presentation is consistent with infrarenal aortitis due to diverticulitis. The patient is an elderly man with a history of diverticulosis, which is a risk factor for aortitis. He presents with abdominal pain and weight loss, which are common symptoms of aortitis. The physical examination reveals minimal abdominal tenderness without signs of peritonitis, which is consistent with aortitis. The laboratory examination reveals mild anemia, which is a non-specific finding that can be seen in aortitis. The blood and urine cultures are negative, which makes an infectious etiology less likely. The CT angiogram shows asymmetric attenuation surrounding the infrarenal aorta, which is a characteristic finding of aortitis.

Mycotic aneurysm is a rare condition that is caused by infection of the aorta. It is more common in patients with underlying conditions such as intravenous drug use, chronic kidney disease, and cancer. The patient in this case does not have any of these underlying conditions.

Inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysm is a condition that is characterized by inflammation of the aorta. It is more common in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, and other inflammatory diseases. The patient in this case does not have any of these underlying conditions.

Pseudoaneurysm is a false aneurysm that is formed when blood leaks out of the aorta and forms a sac. It is more common in patients with trauma, infection, and atherosclerosis. The patient in this case does not have any of these risk factors.

Infrarenal aortitis due to diverticulitis is a condition that is characterized by inflammation of the aorta that is caused by diverticulitis.

 82%|████████▏ | 1254/1525 [4:47:14<1:10:35, 15.63s/it]The correct answer is: B. Perform a skin biopsy for histopathologic examination.

The patient's history and physical examination are concerning for a possible diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum, a rare, chronic, and potentially life-threatening skin condition characterized by painful, necrotic ulcers. Pyoderma gangrenosum is often associated with underlying systemic diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and hematologic malignancies.

The first step in the evaluation of a patient with pyoderma gangrenosum is to obtain a skin biopsy for histopathologic examination. This will help to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms. Treatment of pyoderma gangrenosum typically involves systemic corticosteroids and/or immunosuppressive agents. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to debride necrotic tissue or to close ulcers.

The other options are not as appropriate in this case. Option A, obtaining bacterial and mycobacterial cultures of ulcerated area and pursuing treatment with a longer course of antibiotics, is not necessary in the absence of evidence of infection. Option C, obtaining a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest and abdomen, is not necessary to confirm the diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum. Option D, checking the patient's human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status, is not necessary in the absence of other risk factors for HIV infection.

In conclusion, the correct answer is B. Perform a skin biopsy for histopathologic examination.

Explanation:

The elevated platelet count was most likely resulted from a transient and not reproducible finding. The patient had no other symptoms or signs of a myeloproliferative disorder, and her platelet count was normal on a repeat blood count. Additionally, stress of migraine attacks is not a known cause of thrombocytosis. Myelodysplastic syndrome is a rare blood disorder that is characterized by a decrease in the number of healthy blood cells. It is not typically associated with an elevated platelet count.

 82%|████████▏ | 1256/1525 [4:47:39<1:02:57, 14.04s/it]The correct answer is: B. Trichomycosis axillaris.

Trichomycosis axillaris is a fungal infection of the hair follicles in the armpits. It is caused by the fungus Corynebacterium tenuis, which is a common inhabitant of the skin. The fungus forms white, sticky concretions around the hair shafts, which can give the armpit a strong odor.

The patient in the case presented with creamy yellow concretions along several axillary hairs, which is a classic presentation of trichomycosis axillaris. The lesions did not produce itching, which is also consistent with the diagnosis. Physical examination revealed strong axillary odor, which is another characteristic of trichomycosis axillaris.

Hair samples from the affected areas were sent for microscopy examination and microbiologic culture. Direct microscopic examination of the hair shaft showed fungal hyphae and spores attached to the hair shaft. Periodic acid–Schiff stain and Grocott silver stain confirmed the presence of fungal hyphae and spores.

The patient was treated with antiseptic soap and a miconazole nitrate cream. After 2 weeks of treatment, the lesions had resolved and the patient had normal axillary hairs.

The other options are incorrect. Artifactual peripilar hair casts are not associated with a strong odor. Pediculosis axillaris is an infestation of the armpit by lice. White piedra is a fungal infection of the hair shaft that can occur anywhere on the body, but is most common in the scalp.

Explanation:

Eruptive vellus hair cysts are a common, benign skin condition that presents as multiple, small, smooth, brown papules on the trunk and extremities. The lesions are typically asymptomatic, but may occasionally be pruritic. The cause of eruptive vellus hair cysts is unknown, but they are thought to be caused by an obstruction of the hair follicle.

The diagnosis of eruptive vellus hair cysts is usually made clinically. The characteristic appearance of the lesions is usually sufficient to make the diagnosis. However, a biopsy may be performed to rule out other possible causes of papular eruptions, such as urticaria pigmentosa, eruptive syringoma, and lichen nitidus.

The treatment of eruptive vellus hair cysts is not necessary in most cases. The lesions are usually self-limited and resolve within a few months to a year. However, if the lesions are symptomatic, they may be treated with topical steroids or oral antihistamines.

Urticaria pigmentosa is a chronic, pruritic skin condition that is characterized by the appearance of multiple, small, wheals (hives). The wheals are typically pale or pink in color and may be surrounded by an erythematous halo. Urticaria pigmentosa is caused by a degranulation of mast cells, which releases histamine and other inflammatory mediators.

Eruptive syringoma is a rare, benign skin condition that presents as multiple, small, smooth, skin-colored or yellow papules on the face, neck, chest, and upper extremities. The lesions are typically asymptomatic, but may occasionally be pruritic. The cause of eruptive syringoma is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by a proliferation of sweat glands.

Lichen nitidus is a chronic, papular skin condition that is characterized by the appearance of multiple, small, discrete, flat-topped, white papules on the trunk, extremities, and neck. The papules are typically asymptomatic, but may occasionally be pruritic. The cause of lichen nitidus is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune condition.

Explanation:

Argyria is a permanent bluish-gray discoloration of the skin, eyes, and mucous membranes caused by the deposition of silver salts in the body. It is most commonly caused by the ingestion of silver-containing compounds, such as silver nitrate, but it can also be caused by the topical application of silver-containing products, such as silver sulfadiazine.

In the case of the woman in the prompt, she had a history of rheumatoid arthritis treated with oral gold salts 15 years ago. Gold salts are known to be associated with argyria, and the woman's history of taking them is consistent with her diagnosis.

The woman's presentation is also consistent with argyria. She developed diffuse blue to slate-gray patches on her entire face immediately after administration of Q-switched Nd:YAG laser toning. These pigmented lesions corresponded exactly to areas that had previously received laser treatment. This is consistent with the deposition of silver salts in the skin, which can cause a permanent bluish-gray discoloration.

The woman's diagnosis was confirmed by a skin biopsy specimen of the lesion on the right side of her face. Histopathologic evaluation revealed the presence of silver deposits in the skin. This is a definitive diagnostic finding for argyria.

The other possible diagnoses are not consistent with the woman's presentation. Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation is a temporary darkening of the skin that can occur after inflammation. However, the woman's pigmentation was permanent, which is not consistent with postinflammatory hyperpigmentation. Chrysiasis is a condition characterized by a greenish-yellow discoloration of the skin and eyes caused by the deposition of gold salts. However, the woman's pigmentation was bluish-gray, which is not consistent with chrysiasis. Tattoo pigmentation is the permanent deposition of pigment in the skin after tattooing. However, the woman's pigmentation was not caused by tattooing, as she had not had any tattoos done.

Explanation:

The patient has a history of recurrent meningioma of the right sphenoid wing after tumor resections, followed by adjuvant radiation. This history suggests that the patient may have radiation retinopathy, which is a condition that can cause blurred vision, retinal ischemia, and neovascularization. Intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy is a treatment for radiation retinopathy that has been shown to be effective in improving visual acuity and reducing the risk of neovascularization.

Observation is not an appropriate treatment for radiation retinopathy, as it is a progressive condition that can lead to permanent vision loss. Macular laser photocoagulation is a treatment for diabetic retinopathy, but it is not effective for radiation retinopathy. Intravitreal corticosteroid therapy is a treatment for uveitis, but it is not effective for radiation retinopathy.

Therefore, the correct answer is C. Intravitreal anti–vascular endothelial growth factor therapy.

The patient has a history of seasonal allergies and his symptoms have persisted despite previous treatment regimens with topical corticosteroids and topical antibiotics. This suggests that the patient's conjunctivitis may be allergic in nature. An allergist can perform further testing to confirm the diagnosis and recommend appropriate treatment.

Oral acyclovir is a medication used to treat herpes simplex virus infections. The patient's conjunctivitis is not caused by herpes simplex virus, so oral acyclovir would not be effective.

Topical corticosteroids and cyclosporine are medications used to treat inflammation. The patient's conjunctivitis is likely caused by an allergic reaction, so topical corticosteroids and cyclosporine would not be effective.

Oral cimetidine is a medication used to treat stomach ulcers. The patient's conjunctivitis is not caused by a stomach ulcer, so oral cimetidine would not be effective.

Explanation:
The patient in this case has a number of clinical features that are suggestive of a paraneoplastic syndrome, including a history of smoking, recent weight loss, and a combination of neurological and systemic symptoms. In particular, the combination of diplopia, ataxia, and elevated protein and lymphocyte count in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is highly suggestive of a paraneoplastic syndrome.

The next step in the evaluation of this patient should be to obtain a whole-body fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)/CT scan and paraneoplastic antibody evaluation. FDG-PET/CT is a sensitive imaging modality that can be used to detect the presence of tumors, particularly small tumors that may not be visible on conventional imaging studies. Paraneoplastic antibodies are antibodies that are produced by the immune system in response to cancer cells. The presence of paraneoplastic antibodies can provide evidence of a paraneoplastic syndrome.

Evoked potentials and electromyography (EMG) are tests that can be used to evaluate the function of the nervous system. However, these tests are not specific for paraneoplastic syndromes and would not be the next step in the evaluation of this patient. Thiamine is a vitamin that is essential for the function of the nervous system. However, there is no evidence that thiamine deficiency is a cause of the patient's symptoms. Therefore, checking thiamine levels and starting oral supplementation would not be the next step in the evaluation of this patient.

Acrodermatitis enteropathica is a rare, genetic disorder that causes skin lesions, hair loss, and diarrhea. It is caused by a deficiency of the zinc transporter ZIP4.

Ulcerated segmental infantile hemangioma is a rare type of hemangioma that occurs in the skin. It is characterized by a single, large, ulcerated lesion.

Candida albicans is a yeast that can cause a variety of infections, including diaper rash. Candidal diaper rash is characterized by red, irritated skin in the diaper area.

Jacquet erosive diaper dermatitis is a common type of diaper rash that occurs when the skin in the diaper area is exposed to moisture and friction. It is characterized by red, irritated skin with small erosions.

The patient in the case presented with a well-demarcated ulcer with scalloped borders on either side of the midline, superior to the anal verge. There was no exudate or drainage. The base of the ulcer was covered with fibrinous material and the residue of topical medications. Bright red matted telangiectasias extended from the anus to the ulcers. These findings are consistent with Jacquet erosive diaper dermatitis.

Acrodermatitis enteropathica would not be a likely diagnosis because the patient did not have any of the other characteristic features of the disorder, such as hair loss or diarrhea.

Ulcerated segmental infantile hemangioma would not be a likely diagnosis because the patient did not have any of the other characteristic features of the disorder, such as a single, large, ulcerated lesion.

Explanation:

The patient's history of localized invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast treated with wide local excision 13 years previously is highly suggestive of metastatic breast carcinoma. The MRI scan findings of a spiculated border and ill-defined surrounding enhancement extending close to the stylomastoid foramen are also consistent with metastatic disease. The cytologic findings of loosely cohesive groups of atypical epithelial cells and the histologic findings of an infiltrative lesion composed of cords and nests of medium-sized cells surrounded by a densely hyalinized stroma are also consistent with metastatic breast carcinoma. The immunohistochemical analysis showing that the cells are diffusely positive for cytokeratin 7 (CK7), estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and androgen receptor (AR) provides further support for the diagnosis of metastatic breast carcinoma.

Adenoid cystic carcinoma, salivary duct carcinoma, and carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma are all primary salivary gland tumors. They are all rare tumors, with adenoid cystic carcinoma being the most common. Adenoid cystic carcinoma is a slow-growing tumor that is often locally invasive but rarely metastasizes. Salivary duct carcinoma is a more aggressive tumor that is more likely to metastasize. Carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma is a rare tumor that arises from a preexisting pleomorphic adenoma, which is a benign salivary gland tumor. It is a locally aggressive tumor that is more likely to metastasize than adenoid cystic carcinoma or salivary duct carcinoma.

In this case, the patient's history, clinical presentation, and imaging and pathologic findings are all consistent with metastatic breast carcinoma. The other diagnoses are less likely given the patient's history and presentation.

 83%|████████▎ | 1264/1525 [4:49:24<56:35, 13.01s/it]The answer is C: Juvenile xanthogranuloma.

Juvenile xanthogranuloma (JXG) is a benign, self-limited, non-Langerhans histiocytosis of infancy and childhood. It is the most common form of histiocytosis in children, accounting for 50% of cases. JXG typically presents as a solitary skin lesion, but can also involve the eyes, bones, and other organs. The lesions are typically yellow-brown, papular or nodular, and often have a central umbilication. They are most commonly found on the head and neck, but can occur anywhere on the body.

JXG is a diagnosis of exclusion, and other conditions such as Spitz nevus, pyogenic granuloma, and dermatofibroma must be ruled out. The diagnosis is confirmed by histopathologic examination, which shows a proliferation of lipidized histiocytes.

JXG is a self-limited condition that usually resolves within a few years. Treatment is not usually necessary, but can be considered for lesions that are symptomatic or cosmetically unacceptable. Treatment options include surgery, laser therapy, and cryotherapy.

The following are the reasons why C is the correct answer:

* The patient is a male infant, which is the typical age group for JXG.
* The lesion is located on the postauricular area, which is a common site for JXG.
* The lesion is a solitary, yellow-brown papule, which is the typical appearance of JXG.
* The lesion has a central umbilication, which is a characteristic feature of JXG.
* The histopathologic examination shows a proliferation of lipidized histiocytes, which is the classic finding of JXG.

The following are the reasons why A, B, and D are incorrect:

* Spitz nevus is a benign neoplasm of melanocytes. It typically presents as a solitary, pink or brown papule on the skin. The histopathologic examination shows a proliferation of melanocytes with nuclear atypia.
* Pyogenic granuloma is a benign, vascular lesion of the skin. It typically presents as a solitary, red, pedunculated papule or nodule. The histopathologic examination shows a proliferation of capillaries and granulation tissue.
* Dermatofibroma is a benign, fibrous tumor of the skin. It typically presents as a solitary, skin-colored or brown papule or nodule. The histopathologic examination shows a proliferation of fibroblasts and collagen.

Ameloblastoma is a common odontogenic tumor that arises from the enamel organ. It is usually benign, but it can be locally aggressive. The most common presentation is a painless swelling in the jaw. Radiographically, ameloblastomas are often multilocular and expansile. They can also be cystic or solid.

The patient in this case presents with a painless swelling of the anterior mandible that has been present for 7 months. The mass is hard in consistency and has relatively normal overlying mucosa. Computed tomography (CT) images show a grossly expansile, multilocular, low-attenuation lesion of the anterior segment of the mandible. The images demonstrate severe erosion of the facial and lingual cortices with a remarkable scalloping pattern, and multiple wispy, ill-defined intralesional septa. Soft-tissue CT images indicate a cystic and solid nature of the mass.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of ameloblastoma. The other options are incorrect because they do not typically present with the clinical and radiographic features described in this case.

Central mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a malignant salivary gland tumor that can occur in the mandible. It is usually seen in middle-aged adults and presents with a painless swelling in the jaw. Radiographically, central mucoepidermoid carcinomas are often unilocular and expansile. They can also be cystic or solid.

Ameloblastic carcinoma is a rare malignant odontogenic tumor that arises from the enamel organ. It is usually seen in adults and presents with a painful swelling in the jaw. Radiographically, ameloblastic carcinomas are often multilocular and expansile. They can also be cystic or solid.

Odontogenic myxoma is a benign odontogenic tumor that arises from the mesenchymal cells of the dental follicle. It is usually seen in young adults and presents with a painless swelling in the jaw. Radiographically, odontogenic myxomas are often multilocular and expansile. They can also be cystic or solid.

Explanation:

The patient presented with a history of persistent globus pharyngis spanning 2 decades. She stated that she had no other symptoms, and her family medical history was not remarkable. On examination, the rigid indirect laryngoscopy revealed yellowish floppy granular proliferation affecting the bilateral arytenoids and posterior aspects of the aryepiglottic folds, with symmetrical vocal cord motion. The main lesions were clearly demarcated from the surrounding normal mucosa. The patient then underwent microlaryngeal surgery with biopsy under general anesthesia. The nidus was fragile and bled copiously when traumatized. The specimens mounted on the hematoxylin-eosin slides showed eosinophilic amorphous material underlying the epithelium. Staining for thioflavin T revealed yellow-green fluorescence. The fibrillar component emitted a characteristic apple-green birefringence under polarized light after binding to Congo red dye. No clinical evidence of systemic involvement and/or plasma cell dyscrasia was found.

The most likely diagnosis is localized laryngeal amyloidosis. Amyloidosis is a group of disorders characterized by the deposition of abnormal proteins in the extracellular space. The proteins that form amyloid can be of either immunoglobulin or non-immunoglobulin origin. Localized laryngeal amyloidosis is a rare form of amyloidosis that affects the larynx. It is most often seen in older adults, and women are more commonly affected than men. The cause of localized laryngeal amyloidosis is unknown, but it is thought to be related to an abnormal immune response.

The clinical presentation of localized laryngeal amyloidosis is variable. Some patients may be asymptomatic, while others may experience hoarseness, dysphagia, and stridor. The diagnosis of localized laryngeal amyloidosis is made on the basis of biopsy. The treatment of localized laryngeal amyloidosis is aimed at relieving symptoms and preventing progression of the disease. Treatment options include surgery, laser therapy, and radiation therapy.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation. Lipoma is a benign tumor of fat cells. Sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect any organ system in the body. Gouty tophi are deposits of uric acid crystals.

Explanation:

A ranula is a type of cyst that forms in the sublingual salivary gland. It is typically a small, painless mass that is filled with saliva. A ranula is not cancerous.

A lymphangioma is a type of tumor that forms from lymph vessels. It can occur anywhere in the body, but is most common in the neck, axilla, and groin. Lymphangiomas can be small or large, and can be single or multiple. They are usually not cancerous.

A dermoid cyst is a type of cyst that forms from skin cells. It can occur anywhere in the body, but is most common on the head, neck, and face. Dermoid cysts are usually filled with hair, oil, and sebum. They are not cancerous.

A suprahyoid thyroglossal duct cyst is a type of cyst that forms from the thyroglossal duct. The thyroglossal duct is a tube that forms in the embryo and helps to transport thyroid tissue to its final position in the neck. If the thyroglossal duct does not close properly, a cyst can form. Suprahyoid thyroglossal duct cysts are usually located in the midline of the neck, just above the hyoid bone. They can be small or large, and can be single or multiple. They are usually not cancerous.

In the case presented, the patient has a 6-cm nontender mass in the submentum. The mass is well-circumscribed, avascular, homogeneous, isoechoic, and demonstrates a fluid signal with T2 hyperintensity, T1 hypointensity, and peripheral rim enhancement. Mild restricted diffusion is also noted. The mass is located above the mylohyoid muscle and extends into the FOM between bilateral genioglossus muscles. The mass was removed entirely via transcervical excision.

The clinical presentation, imaging findings, and surgical findings are all consistent with a suprahyoid thyroglossal duct cyst. Therefore, the correct diagnosis is D. Suprahyoid thyroglossal duct cyst.

* **Plantar warts** are caused by a virus called the human papillomavirus (HPV). They are typically small, raised, and hard, and they can be painful. However, they are not usually associated with pancytopenia or a history of lymphoma.
* **Shingles** is caused by the varicella zoster virus, which is the same virus that causes chickenpox. It is characterized by a painful, blistering rash that typically occurs on one side of the body. The rash is often preceded by tingling or burning sensations in the area. Shingles is not usually associated with pancytopenia or a history of lymphoma.
* **Cutaneous lymphoma** is a type of cancer that affects the skin. It can present with a variety of skin lesions, including papules, plaques, nodules, and tumors. The lesions can be painful, but they are not usually associated with pancytopenia or a history of lymphoma.
* **Toxic erythema of chemotherapy** is a side effect of chemotherapy that can cause a rash on the skin. The rash is typically characterized by red, itchy papules and plaques. It is often associated with pancytopenia, as the chemotherapy drugs can suppress the bone marrow.

In this case, the patient has a history of lymphoma, and he is currently receiving chemotherapy. He also has pancytopenia, which is a low white blood cell count, red blood cell count, and platelet count. The lesions on his foot are painful, and they are associated with a rash on his thigh. These findings are most consistent with toxic erythema of chemotherapy.

 83%|████████▎ | 1269/1525 [4:50:41<1:03:42, 14.93s/it]The correct answer is: A. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST).

Explanation:

The patient is a 52-year-old woman with a history of diabetes mellitus and cigarette smoking who had a prior laparoscopic cholecystectomy. She was referred to the hospital for severe postprandial epigastric abdominal pain that had been ongoing for several months and unintentional weight loss. She had been prescribed total parenteral nutrition prior to referral. On presentation, her physical examination was remarkable for mild epigastric tenderness. The results of laboratory testing, including a complete blood cell count, chemistry values, liver function tests, and amylase and lipase levels, were unremarkable. Computed tomography demonstrated focal gastric thickening. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy with endoscopic ultrasonography was performed that confirmed a submucosal gastric mass. A fine-needle aspiration biopsy revealed benign and reactive glandular cells and debris. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography demonstrated a 2.4-cm hypervascular and exophytic mass in the gastric antrum and locoregional lymphadenopathy.

The differential diagnosis for a submucosal gastric mass includes GIST, gastric cancer, peptic ulcer disease, and ectopic pancreas. GIST is a rare mesenchymal tumor that arises from the interstitial cells of Cajal. It is the most common mesenchymal tumor of the gastrointestinal tract. GISTs are typically diagnosed in the fifth or sixth decade of life and are more common in men than women. The most common symptom of GIST is abdominal pain, which is often described as a dull, aching pain in the epigastric or left upper quadrant of the abdomen. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and fatigue. GISTs can be diagnosed with imaging studies, such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A definitive diagnosis is made with a biopsy. GISTs are typically treated with surgery. If the tumor is localized, surgery may be curative. If the tumor is metastatic, treatment may include chemotherapy or targeted therapy.

Gastric cancer is a type of cancer that starts in the stomach. It is the second most common cancer in the world, after lung cancer. Gastric cancer is more common in men than women. The most common symptom of gastric cancer is abdominal pain. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and fatigue. Gastric cancer can be diagnosed with imaging studies, such as CT or MRI. A definitive diagnosis is made with a biopsy. Gastric cancer is typically treated with surgery. If the tumor is localized, surgery may be curative. If the tumor is metastatic, treatment may include chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

Peptic ulcer disease is a condition in which a peptic ulcer develops in the lining of the stomach or small intestine. Peptic ulcers are caused by a combination of factors, including the bacterium Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) and the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The most common symptom of peptic ulcer disease is abdominal pain. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and heartburn. Peptic ulcer disease can be diagnosed with imaging studies, such as CT or MRI. A definitive diagnosis is made with an endoscopy. Peptic ulcer disease is typically treated with medication. If the ulcer is caused by H. pylori, antibiotics are used to treat the infection. If the ulcer is caused by NSAIDs, the NSAID is stopped.

Ectopic pancreas is a condition in which pancreatic tissue develops outside of the pancreas. Ectopic pancreas is most commonly found in the stomach, but it can also be found in the small intestine, colon, and liver. Ectopic pancreas is usually asymptomatic, but it can cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Ectopic pancreas is diagnosed with imaging studies, such as CT or MRI. A definitive diagnosis is made with a biopsy. Ectopic pancreas is usually not treated, but it can be removed surgically if it is causing symptoms.

In this case, the patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a GIST. The CT scan shows a focal gastric thickening, which is a common finding in GISTs. The endoscopy with endoscopic ultrasonography confirms the presence of a submucosal gastric mass, which is also a common finding in GISTs. The fine-needle aspiration biopsy reveals benign and reactive glandular cells and debris, which is not diagnostic of a GIST. However, the magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography demonstrates a 2.4-cm hypervascular and exophytic mass in the gastric antrum, which is a classic finding in GISTs. Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is GIST.

 83%|████████▎ | 1270/1525 [4:50:58<1:05:21, 15.38s/it]The answer is: **A. Schwannoma**

A schwannoma is a benign nerve sheath tumor that arises from Schwann cells, which are the cells that wrap and insulate nerve fibers. Schwannomas are the most common type of peripheral nerve tumor, and they can occur anywhere in the body where there are nerves. However, they are most commonly found in the head and neck region, followed by the arms and legs.

Schwannomas are typically slow-growing tumors, and they may not cause any symptoms for many years. However, as they grow, they can compress surrounding nerves and cause pain, numbness, weakness, or tingling. In some cases, schwannomas can also cause facial paralysis or hearing loss.

The diagnosis of a schwannoma is usually made with a combination of physical examination, imaging studies, and laboratory tests. Imaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) can help to determine the size, location, and shape of the tumor. Laboratory tests may be used to rule out other possible causes of the symptoms.

The treatment of a schwannoma depends on the size, location, and symptoms of the tumor. Small, asymptomatic tumors may be monitored without treatment. However, larger tumors or tumors that are causing symptoms may need to be surgically removed. In some cases, radiation therapy may also be used to treat a schwannoma.

The prognosis for patients with schwannomas is generally good. Most patients with schwannomas have a long and uneventful life. However, there is a small risk of the tumor recurring after surgery, and in rare cases, schwannomas can become malignant.

The patient in the case presented with a 6-month history of progressive swelling and pain on the right side of her neck. The patient also described a history of sleep apnea, a remote transient ischemic attack with left-sided weakness, and a prior thyroidectomy. She had increasing fatigue during the last 6 months, as well as worsening anxiety. On physical examination, the neck was supple, with no palpable masses or lymphadenopathy, and had a well-healed transverse neck incision. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a 1.1-cm, round, partially enhancing, cystic mass near the tail of the parotid gland that appeared hypointense on T2-weighted imaging. An enlarged and distended venous structure that measured up to 7 mm was also visualized in the area. Laboratory work revealed no abnormalities.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is a schwannoma. Schwannomas are benign nerve sheath tumors that arise from Schwann cells, which are the cells that wrap and insulate nerve fibers. Schwannomas are the most common type of peripheral nerve tumor, and they can occur anywhere in the body where there are nerves. However, they are most commonly found in the head and neck region, followed by the arms and legs.

Schwannomas are typically slow-growing tumors, and they may not cause any symptoms for many years. However, as they grow, they can compress surrounding nerves and cause pain, numbness, weakness, or tingling. In some cases, schwannomas can also cause facial paralysis or hearing loss.

The diagnosis of a schwannoma is usually made with a combination of physical examination, imaging studies, and laboratory tests. Imaging studies such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) can help to determine the size, location, and shape of the tumor. Laboratory tests may be used to rule out other possible causes of the symptoms.

The treatment of a schwannoma depends on the size, location, and symptoms of the tumor. Small, asymptomatic tumors may be monitored without treatment. However, larger tumors or tumors that are causing symptoms may need to be surgically removed. In some cases, radiation therapy may also be used to treat a schwannoma.

The prognosis for patients with schwannomas is generally good. Most patients with schwannomas have a long and uneventful life. However, there is a small risk of the tumor recurring after surgery, and in rare cases, schwannomas can become malignant.

Explanation:

The patient has a positive ANA test result, but she does not have any of the classic symptoms of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), such as fever, weight loss, photosensitivity, malar rashes, skin thickening, oral or nasal ulcers, weakness, Raynaud phenomenon, sicca symptoms, chest pain, shortness of breath, or abdominal pain. She also has no family history of autoimmune diseases. In addition, her vital signs, including blood pressure, were normal; and results of skin, thyroid, musculoskeletal, mucus membranes, cardiovascular, pulmonary, and neurologic examinations were all normal. These findings suggest that the patient's positive ANA test result is likely due to an autoimmune thyroid disease, such as Hashimoto's thyroiditis, rather than SLE.

A positive ANA test result is not specific for SLE. In fact, it can be found in a variety of autoimmune diseases, as well as in some non-autoimmune conditions. The presence of a positive ANA test result should always be interpreted in the context of the patient's clinical presentation. In this case, the patient's positive ANA test result is likely due to an autoimmune thyroid disease, rather than SLE.

Explanation: The patient's history of fatigue, elevated white blood cell count with increased immature granulocytes, and palpable spleen are concerning for acute myeloid leukemia (AML). A bone marrow biopsy is the most definitive test to diagnose AML. It can also help to determine the subtype of AML, which is important for choosing the best treatment.

A heterophile antibody test is used to diagnose infectious mononucleosis, which is a common cause of an elevated white blood cell count. However, the patient's history and physical examination are not consistent with infectious mononucleosis.

Chemotherapy is not indicated without a diagnosis of AML. Leukapheresis is a procedure to remove white blood cells from the blood. It is not a treatment for AML.

Iododerma is a skin condition that is caused by the accumulation of iodine in the skin. It can be caused by exposure to iodine-containing medications, such as amiodarone, or by the ingestion of iodine-containing foods, such as seafood. The condition is characterized by the development of red, scaly papules or nodules on the skin. The lesions are often pruritic and may be painful. In severe cases, the lesions may ulcerate and form crusts.

The diagnosis of iododerma is made based on the clinical presentation and the results of a biopsy. The biopsy will show the presence of inflammatory cells, such as neutrophils, in the skin. Treatment of iododerma involves the removal of the source of iodine exposure. In mild cases, topical steroids may be effective. In more severe cases, oral corticosteroids or other medications may be necessary.

The other options are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's presentation. Sweet syndrome is a febrile neutrophilic dermatosis that is characterized by the development of tender, erythematous plaques or nodules. Sporotrichosis is a fungal infection that can cause skin lesions, lymphadenopathy, and pulmonary infection. Pemphigus vegetans is an autoimmune blistering disease that is characterized by the development of large, flaccid bullae on the skin.

Explanation:
The patient has an ulcerated plaque on the forearm with 2 tender, 1- to 2-cm red nodules in the right antecubital fossa. The patient had been discharged approximately 2 weeks prior, after an admission for congestive heart failure. A few days after that discharge, the patient noticed a painful ulceration on the right distal forearm, at the site where a peripheral intravenous catheter had been inserted during her initial hospitalization. On further questioning, the patient noted that between her hospitalizations she had gone home and cleaned her fish tank, played with her pet cat, and gardened in her indoor cactus garden. She said she had not recently traveled, and was not taking any immunosuppressive medications. A skin biopsy and culture were performed from the forearm lesion. The skin biopsy showed a dense neutrophilic infiltrate with associated tissue necrosis. The Gram stain showed organisms consistent with Mycobacterium marinum.

Mycobacterium marinum is a nontuberculous mycobacterium that causes skin and soft tissue infections in humans. The infection is acquired through contact with contaminated water, such as aquarium water, swimming pools, or hot tubs. The most common presentation is a single, ulcerated nodule on an extremity. The infection can spread to the lymph nodes and rarely to other organs.

The treatment of Mycobacterium marinum infection is with antibiotics, such as clarithromycin or minocycline. The infection is usually treated for 6 to 8 weeks.

The other possible diagnoses are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of skin infections, but it is not usually associated with ulcerated plaques.
* Nocardia brasiliensis is a rare cause of skin infections, but it is more commonly seen in patients with underlying immunosuppression.
* Sporotrichosis schenckii is a fungal infection that can cause skin lesions, but it is not usually associated with lymphadenopathy.

A 4-mm punch biopsy was performed on the right axilla for evaluation. The histopathologic findings showed a foreign body granuloma with giant cells and lymphocytes. The patient's history of using an aluminum-containing antiperspirant spray for years before the onset of the eruption and the lack of improvement with multiple medications, including topical antifungals, topical corticosteroids, oral ketoconazole, topical dapsone, doxycycline (40 mg/d), minocycline (100 mg twice daily), a combination of amoxicillin and clavulanate, and intralesional triamcinolone acetonide, are all consistent with a diagnosis of talc granuloma.

The lesion is a hemangioma, which is a benign tumor of blood vessels. Hemangiomas are the most common type of tumor in infants, and they typically regress spontaneously within a few years. However, some hemangiomas can grow rapidly and cause problems, such as ulceration, bleeding, and obstruction of the visual axis. In these cases, surgical excision is the treatment of choice.

The other options are incorrect because they would not be appropriate for a hemangioma that is growing rapidly and causing problems. Option A (continue observation) would not be appropriate because the lesion is growing rapidly and causing problems.

Fluorescein angiography is a diagnostic procedure that uses a special dye to visualize the blood vessels in the eye. It is used to diagnose a variety of eye conditions, including diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, and macular degeneration.

In this case, the patient is presenting with acute-onset bilateral decreased vision and metamorphopsia. These symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (APMPPE). APMPPE is a rare, self-limiting inflammatory condition of the retina. It is characterized by the sudden onset of multiple, yellow-white lesions in the retina. The lesions typically resolve within a few weeks to months, but they can cause permanent vision loss.

Fluorescein angiography is the gold standard for diagnosing APMPPE. The dye is injected into a vein in the arm, and it is then taken up by the blood vessels in the retina. The images produced by fluorescein angiography can help to identify the location and extent of the lesions. They can also help to rule out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms, such as central retinal vein occlusion or diabetic retinopathy.

In this case, the patient's history and examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of APMPPE. The fluorescein angiography results will help to confirm the diagnosis and rule out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms. The results of the fluorescein angiography will also help to guide the patient's treatment.

A: B-scan ultrasonography is a non-invasive imaging technique that uses sound waves to create images of the eye. It is used to diagnose a variety of eye conditions, including retinal detachment, vitreous hemorrhage, and foreign bodies in the eye.

B: Electroretinography is a test that measures the electrical activity of the retina. It is used to diagnose a variety of eye conditions, including retinal detachment, macular degeneration, and optic nerve atrophy.

D: Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) is a non-invasive imaging technique that uses magnetic fields to create images of the blood vessels in the brain and spinal cord. It is used to diagnose a variety of neurological conditions, including stroke, aneurysm, and arteriovenous malformation.

In this case, the patient is presenting with acute-onset bilateral decreased vision and metamorphopsia. These symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy (APMPPE). APMPPE is a rare, self-limiting inflammatory condition of the retina.

Explanation: The patient's history and physical examination are most consistent with a diagnosis of infantile hemangioma. Infantile hemangiomas are the most common benign tumors of infancy, occurring in approximately 5-10% of infants. They are typically present at birth or appear within the first few weeks of life. Infantile hemangiomas are characterized by rapid growth during the first few months of life, followed by a period of involution that typically begins at 9-12 months of age and is complete by 5-10 years of age.

The patient's history of a left-sided facial mass that was present at birth and grew rapidly during the first few months of life is consistent with the diagnosis of infantile hemangioma. The patient's physical examination findings of a nontender, faint blue patch with subtle swelling and thick, coarse overlying hair on the left preauricular-temporal part of the scalp are also consistent with the diagnosis of infantile hemangioma.

The differential diagnosis for a left-sided facial mass in an infant includes acute parotitis, parotid abscess, venous malformation, and plexiform neurofibroma. However, the patient's history and physical examination findings are most consistent with the diagnosis of infantile hemangioma.

Acute parotitis is a bacterial infection of the parotid gland that is characterized by fever, pain, and swelling of the parotid gland. Parotid abscess is a more severe form of acute parotitis that is characterized by the formation of a collection of pus in the parotid gland. Venous malformations are abnormal collections of veins that can occur anywhere in the body. Plexiform neurofibromas are benign tumors of the peripheral nerves that can occur anywhere in the body.

The patient's history and physical examination findings are not consistent with the diagnosis of acute parotitis, parotid abscess, or venous malformation. The patient does not have a fever, pain, or swelling of the parotid gland. The patient's facial mass is not tender, and it does not have the classic features of a parotid abscess. The patient's facial mass is not a collection of veins, and it does not have the classic features of a venous malformation.

Explanation:

The patient is a young Asian man with a nontender mass in the left parotid region that has been slowly enlarging for 18 months. He has also experienced occasional blepharospasm and paresthesia in the ipsilateral eye and cheek. He has also noted an unintended 3-kg weight loss in the same duration, which he subjectively attributed to the stress of school. Physical examination demonstrates a firm, immobile, irregular mass in the left parotid and approximately 3 × 3 cm in size. Mild left-sided buccal weakness was noted. Otherwise, his cranial nerve function was intact. Fine needle aspiration demonstrated medium-size ovoid cells with minimal cytoplasm in crowded groups. T2-weighted magnet resonance imaging following the initial computed tomographic (CT) scan demonstrated a poorly marginated mass that was 4 cm in maximum diameter abutting the left superficial parotid with involvement of the masseter. A parotidectomy with excision of the tumor was planned. During the initial exposure of the tumor, an intraoperative frozen section demonstrated a cellular infiltrate, and a diagnosis of lymphoma could not be excluded. Given the size and fixed nature of the tumor, the decision was made to stop resection on establishing a definitive diagnosis. Flow cytometry demonstrated phenotypically normal T-cell and B-cell populations. Permanent histologic sections demonstrated nests of nonkeratinizing undifferentiated atypical epithelial cells intimately intermingled with a dense lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate. Immunohistochemical analysis for cytokeratin AE1/3 was positive in the carcinoma cells. In situ hybridization for Epstein-Barr virus–encoded small RNAs (EBERs) was positive.

The most likely diagnosis is lymphoepithelial carcinoma of parotid gland. Lymphoepithelial carcinoma is a rare, aggressive neoplasm that typically occurs in young adults. It is characterized by a mixture of epithelial and lymphoid cells, and is associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection. The clinical presentation of lymphoepithelial carcinoma is variable, but typically includes a painless mass in the parotid gland. The diagnosis is made on the basis of histologic examination, and immunohistochemical and molecular testing can be used to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment typically involves surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. The prognosis for patients with lymphoepithelial carcinoma is poor, with a 5-year survival rate of approximately 20%.

The other possible diagnoses are not as likely in this case. Undifferentiated carcinoma of parotid gland is a rare, aggressive neoplasm that typically occurs in older adults. It is characterized by a lack of differentiation of the epithelial cells, and is not associated with Epstein-Barr virus infection. The clinical presentation of undifferentiated carcinoma of parotid gland is similar to that of lymphoepithelial carcinoma, but the prognosis is worse. Lymphoma is a group of neoplasms that arise from the lymphoid system. There are many different types of lymphoma, and the clinical presentation varies depending on the type of lymphoma. Lymphoma is not typically associated with a mass in the parotid gland. Metastatic squamous carcinoma to parotid gland is a rare condition that occurs when a squamous cell carcinoma from another part of the body spreads to the parotid gland. The clinical presentation of metastatic squamous carcinoma to parotid gland is similar to that of lymphoepithelial carcinoma, but the prognosis is worse.

Explanation:

An epidermoid cyst is a benign, slow-growing, cystic tumor that arises from the epidermis. It is the most common type of cyst found in the skin. Epidermoid cysts are typically filled with a cheesy, white material that is composed of keratin, the protein that makes up the outer layer of skin. They can occur anywhere on the body, but are most common on the face, neck, scalp, and back.

The patient in this case is a 5-year-old boy who presented with a 1-year history of a mass gradually growing over the helix of his left auricle. It was associated with minimal pain and intermittently fluctuated in size. Physical examination revealed a single 1.0 × 0.7-cm mass on the left mid helix that was firm, nontender, nonerythematous, and nonerosive. Surgical resection was performed. The resected specimen appeared cystic with granulomatous reaction at the periphery. The lesion was found to be superficially located in the dermis and filled with a soft white material that appeared as purple to blue crystals.

The histopathologic findings are consistent with an epidermoid cyst. The cyst wall is composed of stratified squamous epithelium, and the cyst contents are composed of keratin. The granulomatous reaction at the periphery of the cyst is a foreign-body reaction to the keratin.

The other possible diagnoses are not consistent with the patient's history, physical examination, and histopathologic findings. Schwannomas are benign tumors of Schwann cells, which are the cells that wrap around nerve fibers. They are typically found in the peripheral nerves, but can also occur in the central nervous system. Hamartomas are benign tumors that are composed of normal tissue elements that are present in the wrong place or in an abnormal amount. They can occur anywhere in the body, but are most common in the skin, brain, and gastrointestinal tract. Calcinosis cutis is a condition in which calcium deposits form in the skin. It can be caused by a variety of conditions, including trauma, inflammation, and metabolic disorders.

The most likely diagnosis is a lipoma. Lipomas are benign tumors of fat tissue that are usually slow-growing and asymptomatic. They are typically soft, mobile, and nontender. On imaging, lipomas are typically of fat signal intensity on both T1-weighted and T2-weighted sequences, with heterogeneous soft-tissue enhancement on T1 post-contrast. They also suppress relatively uniformly on short T1 inversion recovery (STIR) sequence. The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a lipoma. The MRI findings are also consistent with a lipoma. Parotitis is an inflammation of the parotid gland. It is usually caused by a viral infection, but can also be caused by bacteria or autoimmune disorders. Parotitis is characterized by pain, swelling, and tenderness of the parotid gland. Sialolipoma is a rare tumor that is composed of both fat and salivary gland tissue. It is typically slow-growing and asymptomatic. Hemangioma is a benign tumor of blood vessels. It can occur anywhere in the body, but is most common on the skin. Hemangiomas are typically red or purple in color and can be raised or flat.

The patient's history of blunt trauma to the left maxilla region approximately 10 years prior to presentation is consistent with the development of Eagle syndrome, a rare condition characterized by the presence of an elongated styloid process that can cause pain, dysphagia, and other symptoms. The patient's symptoms are also consistent with Eagle syndrome, as they are exacerbated by eating and prolonged talking. The physical examination findings are also consistent with Eagle syndrome, as the patient has no hoarseness, weight loss, fever, night sweats, parotid mass, or involuntary facial nerve spasms. The CT scan of the neck demonstrates an ossified mass in the left parapharyngeal space, which is diagnostic of Eagle syndrome.

Hyoid bursitis is a condition characterized by inflammation of the bursae that surround the hyoid bone. This can cause pain, tenderness, and swelling in the neck. Temporomandibular joint dysfunction is a condition characterized by pain and dysfunction of the temporomandibular joint, which is located in the jaw. Metastatic thyroid cancer is a condition in which cancer cells from the thyroid gland have spread to other parts of the body, such as the neck.

The patient has unmutated IGHV genes, which is associated with a poor prognosis in CLL. Unmutated IGHV genes are associated with a higher risk of relapse and a shorter overall survival. Chemoimmunotherapy is the standard of care for CLL, but it is less effective in patients with unmutated IGHV genes.

The other options are incorrect because:

* Option B: The patient is at lower risk of Richter transformation to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Richter transformation is a rare complication of CLL that occurs in 5-10% of patients. It is characterized by the transformation of CLL cells into diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, which is a more aggressive type of cancer. The risk of Richter transformation is not associated with IGHV gene mutation status.
* Option C: IgHV-mutated status is defined by more than a 2% sequence difference compared with the germline sequence and can change over the evolution of the disease. IGHV gene mutation is a somatic mutation that occurs in the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene. It is a hallmark of CLL and is associated with a better prognosis. The mutation rate can change over time, but it is usually stable in most patients.
* Option D: The patient is likely to have unfavorable cytogenetic features, positive ZAP-70 protein expression/promoter unmethylated status, and clonal evolution. Unfavorable cytogenetic features are associated with a poor prognosis in CLL. They include del(17)(p13.1), del(11)(q23), and trisomy 12. ZAP-70 protein expression/promoter unmethylated status is also associated with a poor prognosis. Clonal evolution is the process by which CLL cells acquire new mutations that make them more resistant to treatment.

Explanation:

The patient's history of diarrhea and weight loss is consistent with a malabsorptive process. The presence of a mass in the ampulla of Vater on imaging is also consistent with an IPMN. IPMNs are the most common type of neoplasm of the ampulla of Vater, accounting for up to 80% of cases. They are typically benign, but can be malignant in up to 20% of cases. The diagnosis of IPMN is made by biopsy. Treatment options for IPMNs include endoscopic resection, surgical resection, and surveillance.

Mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs) are also a type of neoplasm of the ampulla of Vater, but they are much less common than IPMNs. MCNs are typically benign, but can be malignant in up to 10% of cases. The diagnosis of MCN is made by biopsy. Treatment options for MCNs include endoscopic resection, surgical resection, and surveillance.

Primary duodenal carcinoid tumors are rare tumors that arise from the neuroendocrine cells of the duodenum. They are typically small and slow-growing, but can be malignant. The diagnosis of carcinoid tumors is made by biopsy. Treatment options for carcinoid tumors include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.

Serous cystadenomas are rare tumors that arise from the epithelial cells of the pancreas. They are typically benign, but can be malignant. The diagnosis of serous cystadenomas is made by biopsy. Treatment options for serous cystadenomas include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.

Explanation:
The patient has a history of right carotid blowout requiring right-sided carotid artery ligation on November 5, 2005. This is a risk factor for the development of an innominate artery pseudoaneurysm. The patient also presents with a pulsatile mass in the upper chest wall on the right side, which is a classic presentation of an innominate artery pseudoaneurysm. The confirmatory magnetic resonance image of the head shows acute right-hemispheric stroke with left-sided hemiparesis, which is consistent with embolic stroke from a source in the right carotid artery. The selective angiogram of the innominate artery shows a pseudoaneurysm at the site of the previous carotid artery ligation.

A carotid stump syndrome is a rare complication of carotid artery ligation that can occur when the distal stump of the carotid artery retracts into the neck and becomes encased in scar tissue. This can lead to narrowing of the carotid artery and subsequent cerebral ischemia. However, the patient in this case does not have any history of neck surgery, so a carotid stump syndrome is not a likely diagnosis.

A subclavian pseudoaneurysm is a rare condition that can occur when the subclavian artery is damaged. This can lead to a bulge in the wall of the artery that fills with blood. Symptoms of a subclavian pseudoaneurysm can include pain, swelling, and a pulsatile mass in the shoulder or arm. However, the patient in this case does not have any symptoms of a subclavian pseudoaneurysm, so this is not a likely diagnosis.

A Kommerell diverticulum is a rare congenital abnormality of the aorta that can occur when there is a weakness in the wall of the aorta. This can lead to a bulge in the wall of the aorta that can fill with blood. Symptoms of a Kommerell diverticulum can include chest pain, back pain, and a pulsatile mass in the chest. However, the patient in this case does not have any symptoms of a Kommerell diverticulum, so this is not a likely diagnosis.

Treatment for autoimmune hepatitis typically involves the use of corticosteroids, such as prednisone, and immunosuppressive agents, such as azathioprine. The patient in this case has been started on these medications, and they have been effective in controlling his disease. The development of fever and rash is a common side effect of these medications, but it is usually not serious. In this case, the rash is likely due to the prednisone, and it should resolve on its own. The patient should continue taking his medications as prescribed, and he should be monitored for any signs of worsening liver disease.

A: Stop atorvastatin secondary to statin-associated hepatitis is incorrect. Statin-associated hepatitis is a rare, but serious, side effect of statins. The patient in this case does not have any evidence of statin-associated hepatitis, and there is no reason to stop his atorvastatin.

C: Check a rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test is incorrect. The RPR test is a screening test for syphilis. The patient in this case does not have any symptoms of syphilis, and there is no reason to check his RPR test.

D: Biopsy the skin lesions is incorrect. Biopsy of the skin lesions is not necessary in this case. The rash is likely due to the prednisone, and it should resolve on its own.

Explanation:
The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with pulmonary embolism (PE). His chest X-ray is normal, which is not surprising given that PE can be difficult to diagnose on X-ray. The attending physician's presumptive diagnosis of PE is reasonable, given the patient's history and physical examination. The patient's pretest clinical probability of PE according to the 2-level Wells score is likely (1.5 points for heart rate >100, and 3.0 for other diagnoses less likely than PE). Therefore, D-dimer measurement was not performed. A CTPA is the most accurate test for PE. In this case, the CTPA shows a large saddle embolus in the right main pulmonary artery. This finding is highly suggestive of PE. Therefore, the next step in management is to anticoagulate the patient with intravenous heparin. The patient should also be started on oral anticoagulation with warfarin or apixaban. The patient should be monitored closely for signs of bleeding or recurrent PE.

A bilateral lower limb veins compression ultrasonography is not necessary in this case, as the CTPA has already confirmed the diagnosis of PE. A lung ventilation-perfusion (V̇/Q̇) scan or pulmonary angiogram is not necessary in this case, as the CTPA is the most accurate test for PE. Testing for D-dimer is not necessary in this case, as the patient's pretest clinical probability of PE is high and the CTPA has already confirmed the diagnosis of PE.

Explanation: The patient's history and physical examination are most consistent with hand, foot, and mouth disease. The patient is a young man who has recently moved to an area where the disease is endemic. He presents with a 1-month history of skin lesions on the palms and soles as well as a 2-week history of lesions in his oropharynx. He reported that a fraction of the lesions had blistered earlier in the course of his illness. The patient also described myalgias and fatigue over the preceding month. On examination, the patient had erythematous papules on bilateral palms and soles as well as eroded vesicles on the palate. Lymphadenopathy was not present. A biopsy specimen of a papule on the left sole was obtained for immunohistochemical staining, which revealed a positive result for coxsackievirus. A serologic antibody test revealed an elevated coxsackievirus titer of 1:16.

Rocky Mountain spotted fever is an acute febrile illness caused by infection with Rickettsia rickettsii, a tick-borne bacterium. The most common clinical presentation is a sudden onset of fever, headache, myalgias, and rash. The rash is characteristically petechial or maculopapular and begins on the wrists and ankles, spreading to the palms, soles, and trunk. Rocky Mountain spotted fever is a potentially fatal disease, but it is treatable with antibiotics.

Secondary syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. The most common clinical presentation is a generalized rash that begins on the trunk and spreads to the extremities. The rash is often described as "macular, papular, and scaly." Secondary syphilis is usually treated with antibiotics.

Primary human immunodeficiency virus infection is the first stage of HIV infection. The most common clinical presentation is a flu-like illness that occurs 2 to 4 weeks after infection. The symptoms of primary HIV infection can include fever, chills, fatigue, headache, muscle aches, sore throat, lymphadenopathy, and rash. Primary HIV infection is usually treated with antiretroviral therapy.

Explanation:

The patient is a man in his 50s with a history of type 2 diabetes and an allogenic bone marrow transplant 1 year prior for myelodysplastic syndrome complicated by pancytopenia and chronic graft-vs-host disease. He presented with a chronic, painful nonhealing ulcer on the right forearm following a ground-level fall 3 months previously. He reported subjective fevers, as well as increasing erythema and tenderness immediately around the right forearm lesion. Physical examination revealed an isolated slightly erythematous, edematous plaque with a prominent central eschar on the right forearm. An incisional biopsy at the edge of the eschar was performed, and a specimen was sent for pathological evaluation.

The histopathologic images show necrotic debris and fat necrosis with saponification, needle-like clefts within necrotic adipocytes, and numerous nonseptate, thick-walled fungal hyphae in the dermis. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of cutaneous aspergillosis.

Cutaneous aspergillosis is a fungal infection of the skin that can occur in immunocompromised patients. It is most commonly caused by Aspergillus fumigatus, but other species such as Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus terreus can also cause infection. The infection can present as a localized lesion or as a disseminated infection. The localized form is the most common and typically presents as a single ulcer or nodule on the skin. The disseminated form is less common and can involve multiple organs, including the lungs, heart, brain, and kidneys.

The diagnosis of cutaneous aspergillosis is made based on clinical presentation, histopathologic findings, and culture results. The treatment of cutaneous aspergillosis is with antifungal medications, such as voriconazole or amphotericin B. The prognosis is generally good with early diagnosis and treatment.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Pyoderma gangrenosum is a neutrophilic dermatosis that can present with ulcers. However, it is not associated with the histopathologic findings seen in this case.
* Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of skin cancer that can also present with ulcers. However, it is not associated with the histopathologic findings seen in this case.
* Cutaneous aspergillosis is a fungal infection that can present with ulcers. The histopathologic findings in this case are consistent with a diagnosis of cutaneous aspergillosis.
* Cutaneous mucormycosis is a fungal infection that can present with ulcers. However, it is not associated with the histopathologic findings seen in this case.

Relapsing polychondritis is a rare autoimmune disease that affects the cartilage of the ears, nose, eyes, joints, and respiratory tract. It is characterized by recurrent episodes of inflammation and destruction of cartilage. The most common symptoms are pain, swelling, and redness of the ears. Other symptoms may include hearing loss, nosebleeds, eye inflammation, joint pain, and respiratory problems.

The diagnosis of relapsing polychondritis is based on a history of the symptoms, a physical examination, and laboratory tests. Imaging studies, such as X-rays, may be helpful in confirming the diagnosis. There is no cure for relapsing polychondritis, but treatment can help to control the symptoms and prevent complications. Treatment typically involves a combination of medications, such as corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and immunosuppressants.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener granulomatosis) is a systemic vasculitis that affects the small and medium-sized arteries. It is characterized by inflammation of the blood vessels, which can lead to tissue damage and organ failure. The most common symptoms are fever, weight loss, fatigue, and joint pain. Other symptoms may include skin rash, sinusitis, and kidney problems.
* Cold agglutinin disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes the body's immune system to attack red blood cells. This can lead to anemia, which is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. The most common symptom is fatigue. Other symptoms may include shortness of breath, pale skin, and cold hands and feet.
* Chilblain is a condition that occurs when the skin is exposed to cold and damp conditions. It is characterized by red, swollen, and painful skin. Chilblains usually go away on their own within a few days, but they can sometimes lead to infection.

 85%|████████▍ | 1292/1525 [4:55:54<53:36, 13.80s/it]The correct answer is: **C. Perform an eyelid nodule biopsy.**

The patient's clinical presentation is consistent with **eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA)**, a rare systemic vasculitis characterized by necrotizing granulomas and inflammation of small and medium-sized blood vessels. EGPA is associated with a number of extravascular manifestations, including skin lesions, pulmonary infiltrates, sinusitis, and gastrointestinal involvement.

The most important diagnostic test for EGPA is a biopsy of an affected tissue, such as a skin lesion or an eyelid nodule. The biopsy will show characteristic granulomatous inflammation. Other laboratory tests that may be helpful in the diagnosis of EGPA include a complete blood count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP).

The treatment of EGPA is with corticosteroids, such as prednisone. Other medications that may be used include cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, or rituximab.

The prognosis for EGPA is generally good with treatment. However, the disease can be life-threatening, especially if it is not treated early.

The other options are incorrect because:

* A. Administering hyperfocal cryotherapy to the eyelid nodules is not a recommended treatment for EGPA.
* B. Starting D-penicillamine therapy is not a recommended treatment for EGPA.
* D. Assessing for enlarged tongue with decreased motility is not a specific finding in EGPA.

Explanation:
The patient in this case has a history of sinusitis and developed diplopia five days after being prescribed antibiotics. The diplopia is painless and horizontal, and is not improved with sleep. The patient has no other neurological symptoms.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is cavernous sinus thrombosis. Cavernous sinus thrombosis is a rare, but serious, infection of the cavernous sinus, which is a large venous sinus located in the skull. The cavernous sinus is located near the optic nerve, the third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerves, and the internal carotid artery. Infection of the cavernous sinus can cause inflammation and swelling of the nerves and blood vessels in the area, which can lead to a variety of symptoms, including diplopia, facial pain, headache, and vision loss.

The gold standard for diagnosis of cavernous sinus thrombosis is magnetic resonance venography (MRV). MRV is a type of MRI that can visualize the veins in the brain and skull. MRV can show if there is any blockage of the veins in the cavernous sinus.

If cavernous sinus thrombosis is diagnosed, treatment typically includes intravenous antibiotics and steroids. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to drain the infection.

The other options are not correct for the following reasons:

* A: Perform a serum test for autoantibodies. Autoantibodies are antibodies that the body's immune system produces against its own tissues. Autoantibodies are not typically associated with cavernous sinus thrombosis.
* B: Perform a tensilon test. A tensilon test is a test that is used to diagnose myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis is a disorder that affects the muscles, causing them to become weak. Myasthenia gravis is not typically associated with cavernous sinus thrombosis.
* D: Restart antibiotic treatment and arrange for an otorhinolaryngology follow-up examination. Restarting antibiotic treatment may be appropriate if the patient has a bacterial sinusitis. However, in this case, the patient has no evidence of bacterial infection. An otorhinolaryngology follow-up examination may be appropriate to rule out other causes of the diplopia, such as a tumor or a nerve problem. However, this is not the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient.

Explanation:
The patient has a history of recurrent right-sided ptosis, each of which occurred at 18 months, 3 years, and 5 years of age. None of these episodes was preceded by fever. During the last 2 episodes, he experienced severe right-sided headache lasting for 6 to 7 days before development of ptosis; he also experienced double vision. There was no history of loss of consciousness, seizures, loss of vision or hearing, facial deviation, trouble swallowing, or weakness of the extremities in any of these episodes. There was history of migraine on the maternal side of the family. There was no family history of autoimmune disorders or cerebral aneurysms. At the time of the clinic visit, the patient was asymptomatic and results of the neurologic examination were normal. The family provided a photograph of the patient’s face at the time of the first episode. After the first episode, with a presumed diagnosis of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis, he received intravenous pulse methylprednisolone sodium succinate, 30 mg/kg, for 3 days and recovered completely in 3 weeks. The patient received intravenous immunoglobulin, 2 g/kg, for 2 days after the subsequent 2 episodes, with a presumed diagnosis of chronic inflammatory demyelinating neuropathy, and recovered fully. Results of brain magnetic resonance imaging performed at 18 months showed thickening of the cisternal part of the right third cranial nerve in the perimesencephalic cistern with no parenchymal lesions. Results of tests on cerebrospinal fluid collected via lumbar puncture were normal.

The most likely diagnosis is recurrent painful ophthalmoplegic neuropathy (RPON). RPON is a rare, idiopathic disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of unilateral ophthalmoplegia, pain, and headache. The pain is often severe and described as a stabbing or burning sensation. The ophthalmoplegia is due to inflammation and demyelination of the third cranial nerve. The diagnosis is made based on the history, physical examination, and imaging studies. The treatment is supportive and includes corticosteroids, pain medication, and physical therapy.

The other options are less likely. Recurrent meningitis is unlikely because the patient does not have a fever or other symptoms of meningitis. A posterior communicating artery aneurysm is unlikely because the patient does not have any symptoms of cerebral ischemia or infarction. Myasthenia is unlikely because the patient does not have any symptoms of weakness or fatigability.

The most likely diagnosis is melanin-pigmented oncocytic metaplasia of the nasopharynx. This is a benign condition characterized by the presence of oncocytic cells, which are cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. The brown pigment in the cytoplasm of these cells is positive for Fontana Masson stain, which is a specific stain for melanin. The absence of dyskeratosis, iron stain, and HMB45 stain further supports the diagnosis of melanin-pigmented oncocytic metaplasia. Malignant melanoma of the nasopharynx is a rare but aggressive malignancy that is typically characterized by the presence of dyskeratosis, which is the presence of abnormal keratinized cells. Metastatic melanoma is a condition in which melanoma cells spread to the nasopharynx from another part of the body.

Explanation:
Myositis ossificans traumatica (MOT) is a rare, benign, self-limiting condition characterized by the formation of heterotopic bone in soft tissues following injury. The most common site of involvement is the muscles of the masticatory system, followed by the extremities. The typical presentation is with pain, swelling, and limitation of motion in the affected area. On imaging, MOT appears as a well-circumscribed, lobulated mass with a soft-tissue component and a central area of ossification. The diagnosis is made on clinical grounds and confirmed by imaging. Treatment is usually conservative, with rest, ice, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the ossified mass.

In the case of the woman in the question, the most likely diagnosis is MOT. She developed severe trismus several months after treatment of a dental abscess, which is a common trigger for MOT. She also had a history of unsuccessful surgery to release her trismus, which is consistent with the diagnosis of MOT. The CT scan shows a well-circumscribed, lobulated mass with a soft-tissue component and a central area of ossification, which is also consistent with MOT.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely. Lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymph nodes. Osteosarcoma is a type of cancer that affects the bones. Tumoral calcinosis is a rare condition characterized by the formation of calcium deposits in the soft tissues. All of these conditions can cause trismus, but they are less likely than MOT in this case.

 85%|████████▌ | 1297/1525 [4:56:57<46:42, 12.29s/it]The correct answer is B: Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma.

Sinonasal undifferentiated carcinoma (SNUC) is a rare, aggressive type of cancer that originates in the sinuses. It is often misdiagnosed as chronic rhinosinusitis with polyposis, which is a more common condition. SNUC is characterized by the presence of atypical, fibrotic polyps that are difficult to remove even with powered instrumentation. The patient in this case presented with a history of nasal polyps, severe headaches, and long-standing visual loss. He also had extensive nasal polyposis, bony remodeling consistent with long-standing inflammation, and massive erosion of the bilateral skull base and orbits. These findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of SNUC.

Allergic fungal rhinosinusitis (AFRS) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the sinuses that is caused by an allergic reaction to fungi. AFRS is characterized by the presence of nasal polyps, sinusitis, and facial pain. However, AFRS does not typically cause the bony remodeling or erosion of the skull base and orbits that is seen in SNUC.

Chronic invasive fungal sinusitis (CIFS) is a rare, life-threatening fungal infection of the sinuses. CIFS is characterized by the presence of invasive fungal hyphae in the sinuses, which can lead to necrosis of the sinus mucosa and bone. CIFS is more common in patients with underlying immunosuppression, such as those with diabetes or HIV/AIDS. The patient in this case does not have any underlying medical conditions that would increase his risk for CIFS.

Chronic rhinosinusitis with polyposis (CRSwP) is a chronic inflammatory condition of the sinuses that is characterized by the presence of nasal polyps. CRSwP is a common condition, affecting up to 10% of the population. However, CRSwP does not typically cause the bony remodeling or erosion of the skull base and orbits that is seen in SNUC.

In conclusion, the patient in this case most likely has SNUC. SNUC is a rare, aggressive type of cancer that originates in the sinuses. It is often misdiagnosed as chronic rhinosinusitis with polyposis, which is a more common condition. The patient's history, physical examination, and imaging findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of SNUC.

The patient's history of adenoid cystic carcinoma of the right submandibular gland and prior wide tumor excision and postoperative radiation therapy 20 years previously is consistent with the development of a radiation-induced sarcoma. The tumor's appearance on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a well-defined, enhancing mass is also consistent with a sarcoma. The microscopic findings of oval to eel-like spindle nuclei distributed in a background of generally wavy collagenous fibers and mucinous matrix are also characteristic of a sarcoma. The specimen's immunoreactivity for S-100 is further supportive of a diagnosis of sarcoma, as S-100 protein is a marker of mesenchymal cells. The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's history, clinical presentation, or imaging findings.

A. Recurrent adenoid cystic carcinoma is unlikely, as the patient has been without evidence of disease for 20 years.

C. Radiation-induced neurofibroma is unlikely, as the patient has no history of neurofibromatosis.

The patient's history and presentation are consistent with sarcoidosis. She has a history of sarcoidosis, which is a multisystem inflammatory disease that can affect the lungs, lymph nodes, eyes, skin, and other organs. The patient's symptoms of sore throat, fever, chills, productive cough, globus sensation, dysphagia, and a change in her voice to the point it had become muffled and hoarse are all consistent with sarcoidosis of the larynx. The patient's examination findings of mildly tender right cervical lymphadenopathy but no evidence of peritonsillar exudates are also consistent with sarcoidosis. The patient's laryngoscopy demonstrated diffuse swelling of the supraglottic structures, particularly the epiglottis and left aryepiglottic fold, with a pale appearance of the mucosa. This finding is also consistent with sarcoidosis. The patient's neck CT scan showed marked swelling of the supraglottic structures with areas of patchy enhancement and narrowing of the airway, as well as enlarged right cervical lymph nodes. These findings are also consistent with sarcoidosis. The patient was intubated and received intravenous steroids and ceftriaxone. Subsequently, she underwent debulking surgery and carbon dioxide laser ablation of the left arytenoid. These treatments are all appropriate for sarcoidosis.

The other possible diagnoses are not as likely. Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma is a rare cancer that typically occurs in older adults. The patient is in her 30s, so this diagnosis is less likely. Angioedema is a sudden swelling of the skin and mucous membranes that is often caused by an allergic reaction. The patient's history and presentation are not consistent with angioedema. Laryngeal tuberculosis is a rare infection that is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The patient's history and presentation are not consistent with laryngeal tuberculosis.

In conclusion, the patient's diagnosis is most likely laryngeal sarcoidosis.

The patient is an 80-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer who presents with fullness near her left eye for 2 months. She denies pain, trauma, or changes in vision. Her right eye had been enucleated 40 years before for choroidal melanoma, and she had been fitted with an ocular prosthesis.

The physical examination reveals mild edema, erythema, and ptosis of the left upper lid. Left cervical lymphadenopathy is present. Best-corrected visual acuity is 20/25, and left ocular motility is full.

The most likely diagnosis in this patient is infectious preseptal cellulitis. This is a bacterial infection of the soft tissues of the eyelid that is most commonly caused by Staphylococcus aureus. It can present with swelling, erythema, and tenderness of the eyelid, as well as ptosis and lymphadenopathy.

The initial management of infectious preseptal cellulitis is with oral antibiotics. In severe cases, intravenous antibiotics may be necessary. In addition, warm compresses and analgesics may be helpful.

The patient in this case should be referred to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation and management. The ophthalmologist will likely perform an orbital computed tomography (CT) scan to rule out orbital cellulitis, which is a more serious infection that involves the tissues of the orbit. The ophthalmologist may also prescribe oral antibiotics.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A: Recommend eyelid scrubs to the left eyelid for blepharitis. Blepharitis is an inflammation of the eyelids that is usually caused by a bacterial infection or seborrheic dermatitis. It can present with redness, itching, and flaking of the eyelids. Eyelid scrubs may be helpful in treating blepharitis, but they are not the first-line treatment for infectious preseptal cellulitis.
* Option C: Prescribe oral amoxicillin sodium–clavulanate potassium for infectious preseptal cellulitis. Amoxicillin sodium–clavulanate potassium is a combination antibiotic that is effective against a wide range of bacteria. It is a reasonable choice for treating infectious preseptal cellulitis, but it should not be the first-line treatment. The patient should be referred to an ophthalmologist for further evaluation and management.
* Option D: Obtain positron-emission tomographic scan to identify metastases. Positron-emission tomography (PET) scan is a nuclear medicine imaging technique that is used to detect cancer. It is not a necessary test in the evaluation of infectious preseptal cellulitis.

Explanation:

GIST is a rare type of cancer that starts in the cells that support the lining of the digestive system. It is the most common type of mesenchymal tumor of the gastrointestinal tract. GISTs can occur anywhere in the digestive system, but they are most common in the stomach and small intestine.

GISTs are usually slow-growing tumors, but they can sometimes grow quickly and spread to other parts of the body. The symptoms of GIST vary depending on the size and location of the tumor. Some people with GIST have no symptoms, while others may experience abdominal pain, weight loss, and fatigue.

The diagnosis of GIST is made with a biopsy. A biopsy is a procedure in which a small piece of tissue is removed from the tumor and examined under a microscope.

The treatment of GIST depends on the size, location, and stage of the tumor. Small, localized GISTs can sometimes be treated with surgery alone. Larger tumors or tumors that have spread to other parts of the body may be treated with a combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.

The prognosis for people with GIST varies depending on the size, location, and stage of the tumor. With treatment, most people with GIST can live for several years or even decades.

The other options are incorrect because:

* Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that starts in the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is part of the immune system and helps the body fight infection.
* Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma is a rare type of liver cancer that occurs in adults. It is usually diagnosed in people in their 30s or 40s.

* The patient is a 5-year-old boy, which is the age group in which pelvic teratomas are most commonly diagnosed.
* The patient has a history of intermittent abdominal pain, which is a common symptom of pelvic teratomas.
* The patient's abdominal radiography revealed multiple polygonal calcified lesions in the pelvis, which are characteristic of pelvic teratomas.
* The patient's computed tomography scan revealed a 5.6 × 5.3 × 4.6-cm midline cystic pelvic mass adjacent to the anterior rectal wall that contained several irregularly shaped ossifications, which are also characteristic of pelvic teratomas.
* The patient's laboratory study results were significant for normal levels of α-fetoprotein and chorionic gonadotropin, which are tumor markers that are typically elevated in patients with germ cell tumors such as teratomas.

Meckel diverticulum, enteric duplication cyst, and carcinoid tumor are all less likely diagnoses in this case. Meckel diverticulum is a congenital anomaly that is most commonly diagnosed in children younger than 2 years of age. Enteric duplication cyst is a rare congenital anomaly that can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract. Carcinoid tumor is a rare neuroendocrine tumor that can occur in any part of the body, but is most commonly found in the small intestine.

The patient is a 44-year-old man with a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease and anxiety who presents for evaluation of mouth ulcers recurring for the past 2 years. The painful ulcers resolve within 2 weeks but recur on different mucosal surfaces. He denies new medications, foods, or oral hygiene products and involvement of cutaneous or other mucosal surfaces. He is uncertain whether he has a family history of oral ulcers. He was previously prescribed anesthetic rinses and fluconazole, without benefit. His current medications include omeprazole and lorazepam. Intraoral examination demonstrates an ulcer with a pseudomembrane and erythematous halo on the left lateral surface of the tongue. Physical examination results are otherwise normal.

The most likely diagnosis is recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS), a common condition characterized by recurrent, painful ulcers that typically resolve within 2 weeks. The diagnosis of RAS is usually made clinically, based on the history and appearance of the ulcers. However, in some cases, a biopsy may be necessary to rule out other possible causes of oral ulcers, such as herpes simplex virus infection, Behçet's disease, or oral cancer.

In this case, the patient's history and physical examination findings are consistent with a diagnosis of RAS. However, the patient has a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease, which can increase the risk of developing oral ulcers. Additionally, the patient's ulcers have recurred for the past 2 years, despite treatment with anesthetic rinses and fluconazole. These factors suggest that the patient may have a more serious underlying condition, such as herpes simplex virus infection, Behçet's disease, or oral cancer. Therefore, it is prudent to obtain a biopsy of the ulcer to rule out these other possible causes.

A complete blood cell count with differential is not necessary in this case. The patient's history and physical examination findings are not concerning for a hematologic disorder. Additionally, a complete blood cell count with differential is not a sensitive or specific test for oral ulcers.

Amoxicillin is not indicated in this case. The patient's ulcers are not caused by a bacterial infection. Additionally, amoxicillin is not effective against herpes simplex virus infection, Behçet's disease, or oral cancer.

Explanation:

Spirometry is a test that measures the amount of air you can breathe in and out. It is used to diagnose and monitor lung conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and cystic fibrosis.

A normal spirometric test shows that you can breathe in and out a large amount of air. However, if you have a restrictive lung disease, your lungs will not be able to expand as much as normal, and you will not be able to breathe in or out as much air.

Spirometry cannot be used to evaluate for obstruction in the setting of a restrictive abnormality because the obstruction is caused by the restrictive lung disease, not by a blockage in the airways.

In the case of the 67-year-old man with a 45-pack-year smoking history, his pulmonary function tests showed that he had a restrictive abnormality. This means that his lungs were not able to expand as much as normal, and he was not able to breathe in or out as much air. The spirometric test could not be used to evaluate for obstruction in this case because the obstruction was caused by the restrictive lung disease, not by a blockage in the airways.

The patient in this case has a history of hyperthyroidism, which is a condition characterized by an overactive thyroid gland. Hyperthyroidism can cause a variety of symptoms, including shortness of breath, weight loss, tremor, diaphoresis, and palpitations. In some cases, hyperthyroidism can also cause an enlarged thymus gland.

A CT scan of the chest shows that the patient's thymus gland is enlarged. An FDG-PET scan also shows that the thymus gland is actively metabolizing glucose, which is a sign of increased activity. These findings suggest that the patient's thymus gland is overactive.

The treatment for an overactive thymus gland is surgery to remove the gland. This procedure is called a thymectomy. Thymectomy is usually a safe and effective procedure. In most cases, it can relieve the symptoms of hyperthyroidism and prevent the condition from recurring.

A referral to medical oncology is not appropriate in this case. Medical oncology is a specialty that deals with the treatment of cancer. The patient in this case does not have cancer.

A biopsy of the thymus is not necessary in this case. The CT scan and FDG-PET scan provide enough information to make a diagnosis and recommend treatment.

Doing nothing now but repeating the CT scan in 3 to 6 months is not a good option in this case. The patient's symptoms are severe and she is at risk for complications. She needs to have surgery to remove her overactive thymus gland.

Explanation: The most likely diagnosis is giant cell fibroblastoma, a benign soft tissue tumor that typically presents in infancy or early childhood. The tumor is characterized by a proliferation of fibroblasts and giant cells, and it often regresses spontaneously. In this case, the patient presented with a nodular lesion on the scalp that was present since birth. The lesion was firm, exophytic, and flat-topped, with superficial erosion and crust. A 4-mm punch skin biopsy was performed, and the tissue was sent for pathologic analysis. The biopsy showed a proliferation of fibroblasts and giant cells, consistent with a diagnosis of giant cell fibroblastoma. The lesion regressed without treatment over a period of 8 months. Close follow-up every 3 months was scheduled, and complete involution of the tumor was noted at 10 months of age.

The other possible diagnoses are infantile myofibromatosis, dermoid cyst, and keratoacanthoma. Infantile myofibromatosis is a rare, congenital condition characterized by the proliferation of myofibroblasts. The tumors can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the skin and subcutaneous tissues. Infantile myofibromatosis can be associated with other congenital anomalies, such as skeletal abnormalities and mental retardation. Dermoid cysts are benign tumors that develop from ectodermal inclusions. They are most common in the head and neck region, but they can occur anywhere in the body. Dermoid cysts are usually filled with sebum, hair, and skin debris. Keratoacanthoma is a rapidly growing, skin-colored papule that can resemble a carcinoma. Keratoacanthomas are most common in middle-aged and elderly people, and they usually resolve spontaneously within 6 to 12 weeks.

In this case, the patient's history, physical examination, and biopsy results are most consistent with a diagnosis of giant cell fibroblastoma. The other possible diagnoses are less likely based on the patient's presentation.

Explanation:

The patient is an immunocompromised man with a history of heart transplant, plasmablastic lymphoma, and recent chemotherapy. He presents with a painless rapidly enlarging ulcer on his left leg. The ulcer is well-demarcated, 5 x 5 cm, round, with a raised border, surrounding erythema, and a base with purulent debris. A superficial swab culture sample grew P aeruginosa. A punch biopsy specimen from the edge of the ulcer was obtained and sent for histopathologic evaluation, which showed enlarged endothelial cells with intranuclear inclusions surrounded by a clear halo, and some cytoplasmic inclusions. Similar findings were detected in some macrophages.

These findings are consistent with cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. CMV is a herpesvirus that can cause a variety of infections in immunocompromised patients, including skin ulcers. The ulcers are typically painless and rapidly enlarging, with a raised border and surrounding erythema. The histopathologic findings of CMV infection include enlarged endothelial cells with intranuclear inclusions surrounded by a clear halo, and some cytoplasmic inclusions.

Ecthyma gangrenosum is a skin infection caused by P aeruginosa. It is characterized by painful ulcers with a black necrotic center. Mucormycosis is a fungal infection that can cause skin ulcers in immunocompromised patients. The ulcers are typically black and necrotic, with a surrounding rim of erythema. Pyoderma gangrenosum is a skin condition that is characterized by painful ulcers with a surrounding rim of erythema. It is typically seen in patients with inflammatory bowel disease or rheumatoid arthritis.

In conclusion, the patient's presentation and histopathologic findings are most consistent with CMV infection.

Explanation:
The patient in the case presented with purpuric lesions on her face, elbows, knees, and feet. She was also noted to have hypercalcemia and acute kidney injury. On physical examination, she had dusky purpuric macules and patches on her nose, bilateral cheeks, forehead, and left ear. Her knees, feet, and the extensor surfaces of her arms had reticulated purpuric macules and patches. There was skin sloughing off the lesions on her elbows and knees. Four-millimeter punch biopsy specimens were taken from the left ear, right arm, and forehead. The histopathologic images showed multifocal intravascular fibrinoid material consisting of a mix of cryoglobulins and fibrin thrombi with relatively little vessel wall inflammation. These findings are consistent with type I cryoglobulinemia associated with multiple myeloma.

Leukocytoclastic vasculitis is a type of vasculitis that is characterized by inflammation of small blood vessels. It can cause purpura, which is bleeding into the skin, as well as other symptoms such as fever, joint pain, and fatigue. However, leukocytoclastic vasculitis is not typically associated with hypercalcemia or acute kidney injury.

Antiphospholipid syndrome is a disorder in which the body's immune system attacks its own blood vessels. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including purpura, but it is not typically associated with hypercalcemia or acute kidney injury.

Purpura fulminans is a rare, life-threatening condition that is characterized by widespread bleeding into the skin and other organs. It is caused by a severe infection or a reaction to certain medications. Purpura fulminans is not typically associated with hypercalcemia or acute kidney injury.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for the patient in the case is type I cryoglobulinemia associated with multiple myeloma.

The patient has bilateral choroidal detachment in Waldenström macroglobulinemia. This is a serious condition that can lead to vision loss if not treated. The first step in treatment is to address the underlying cause of the choroidal detachment, which is the Waldenström macroglobulinemia. This can be done with systemic chemotherapy. In addition, the choroidal detachment itself can be treated with pars plana vitrectomy. This is a surgical procedure that involves removing the vitreous humor from the eye. This can help to relieve pressure on the retina and restore vision.

Observing the patient is not an appropriate treatment for this condition. The choroidal detachment will not resolve on its own and will likely lead to vision loss if not treated. Performing pars plana vitrectomy alone is also not an appropriate treatment. This procedure will not address the underlying cause of the choroidal detachment, which is the Waldenström macroglobulinemia.

Therefore, the correct treatment for this patient is to treat with combined systemic chemotherapy and pars plana vitrectomy. This will address both the underlying cause of the choroidal detachment and the choroidal detachment itself. This is the most likely treatment to result in a good outcome for the patient.

Explanation:

The patient has a serous retinal detachment involving the macula and extending from the 2-o’clock to the 10-o’clock position with pigmentary and atrophic changes in the macula. This is a sight-threatening condition that requires treatment.

Systemic corticosteroid therapy is not effective in treating serous retinal detachment. Observation is not an appropriate management option for this condition, as it will lead to permanent vision loss. Photodynamic therapy is a treatment option for serous retinal detachment, but it is not as effective as anti-VEGF therapy. Anti-VEGF therapy is the most effective treatment for serous retinal detachment. It works by blocking the growth of new blood vessels, which are responsible for the leakage of fluid into the retina. Anti-VEGF therapy is given as an injection into the eye. It is usually effective in resolving serous retinal detachment within a few weeks.

The patient in this case should be treated with anti-VEGF therapy. This will help to prevent permanent vision loss.

A retroperitoneal abscess is a collection of pus in the retroperitoneum, which is the space behind the abdominal organs. It is usually caused by infection, such as from appendicitis or diverticulitis. The patient would typically have fever, abdominal pain, and tenderness. The diagnosis is made with imaging tests, such as a CT scan. Treatment is with antibiotics and, sometimes, surgery to drain the abscess.

A lymphatic malformation is a collection of abnormal lymphatic vessels. It can be present at birth or develop later in life. The patient may have no symptoms, or they may have swelling, pain, and infection. The diagnosis is made with imaging tests, such as an ultrasound or MRI. Treatment is with surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.

A pancreatic pseudocyst is a collection of fluid that forms in the pancreas after inflammation or injury. It is usually caused by pancreatitis. The patient may have abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and fever. The diagnosis is made with imaging tests, such as a CT scan. Treatment is with antibiotics and, sometimes, surgery to drain the pseudocyst.

In this case, the patient is an adolescent girl who presents with abdominal distention. She has not experienced abdominal pain or other symptoms, and there is no history of trauma. Physical examination reveals a firm, distended abdomen without bowel sounds. Pregnancy test results are negative. Results of laboratory studies, including a complete blood cell count, basic metabolic panel, and liver function tests, are within normal limits. An abdominal radiograph showed a paucity of bowel gas markings. A subsequent computed tomographic scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed a 30-cm retroperitoneal cystic structure causing significant mass effect on the abdominal viscera, displacing the right kidney superiorly under the liver causing moderate hydronephrosis.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is a urinoma. Urinomas are caused by urinary tract obstruction, which can occur from a number of conditions, such as kidney stones, tumors, or trauma. The patient in this case does not have any of the risk factors for a retroperitoneal abscess, lymphatic malformation, or pancreatic pseudocyst. The imaging findings are also consistent with a urinoma.

Treatment for a urinoma is usually with surgery to drain the cyst and relieve the obstruction. In some cases, antibiotics may also be necessary.

Chronic invasive fungal sinusitis is a rare, but serious, fungal infection of the sinuses. It is most common in people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS, cancer, or organ transplants. However, it can also occur in people with normal immune systems.

The symptoms of chronic invasive fungal sinusitis can vary depending on the severity of the infection. In mild cases, the patient may only experience nasal congestion, sinus pain, and facial swelling. In more severe cases, the patient may also experience fever, headache, and weight loss.

The diagnosis of chronic invasive fungal sinusitis is made based on the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging studies. A CT scan of the sinuses is often used to confirm the diagnosis.

The treatment of chronic invasive fungal sinusitis typically involves a combination of antifungal medications and surgery. The antifungal medications are used to kill the fungus, while the surgery is used to remove the infected tissue.

The prognosis for people with chronic invasive fungal sinusitis is generally good with treatment. However, if the infection is not treated, it can spread to other parts of the body and be life-threatening.

The other options are incorrect because:

* A: Fungal ball is a type of fungal infection that can occur in the sinuses. However, it is not a chronic infection and does not typically cause the symptoms described in the case.
* C: Invasive squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that can occur in the sinuses. However, it is not a fungal infection and does not typically cause the symptoms described in the case.
* D: Fungal ball and invasive squamous cell carcinoma are both possible diagnoses in this case. However, the symptoms and imaging findings are more consistent with chronic invasive fungal sinusitis.

Explanation:

The patient is a man in his 40s with a 10-year history of smoking 180 packs of cigarettes per year. He choked easily and had experienced a foreign body sensation in his throat for 6 months. He was a tour guide, a profession that requires speech. Because he experienced voice fatigue frequently, he visited a hospital for professional assistance. Fibroscopy showed a well-circumscribed mass of approximately 3 × 3 × 2 cm, with a smooth surface, located at the laryngeal side of the left aryepiglottic fold and covering nearby structures, such as the bilateral vocal cords and left pyriform sinus. A biopsy was performed, and the patient visited our institution (Taipei Veterans General Hospital) for further intervention. The laryngeal mass was removed through transoral laser microsurgery. The tumor was at the submucosa with focally ulcerated overlying epithelium. It was composed of adipocytes of various sizes in a fibromyxoid background. In the fibromyxoid areas, atypical spindle cells with hyperchromatic and enlarged nuclei were present, as well as scattered lipoblasts without areas of dedifferentiation. Immunohistochemically, the tumor exhibited substantial nuclear staining for both CDK4 and MDM2 and stains.

Based on the above information, the most likely diagnosis is well-differentiated liposarcoma of the larynx. This is a rare type of cancer that arises from fat cells. It is usually slow-growing and can be cured with surgery. However, it can sometimes spread to other parts of the body.

The other possible diagnoses are hemangioma of the larynx, schwannoma of the larynx, and laryngocele of the larynx. Hemangiomas are benign tumors that arise from blood vessels. Schwannomas are benign tumors that arise from nerves. Laryngoceles are sac-like structures that can develop in the larynx. All of these tumors are much less common than well-differentiated liposarcoma of the larynx.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for the patient is well-differentiated liposarcoma of the larynx. This is a rare type of cancer that arises from fat cells. It is usually slow-growing and can be cured with surgery. However, it can sometimes spread to other parts of the body.

A rhabdomyosarcoma is a malignant tumor of skeletal muscle. It is the most common soft tissue sarcoma in children, and it can occur anywhere in the body. Rhabdomyosarcomas are typically highly aggressive tumors, and they often metastasize (spread) to other organs.

A venous malformation is a congenital (present at birth) abnormality of the veins. Venous malformations can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the head and neck region. Venous malformations are typically benign (noncancerous) tumors, but they can sometimes grow and cause symptoms such as pain, swelling, and bleeding.

A masticator space abscess is a collection of pus that forms in the masticator space, which is a region of the face that contains the muscles involved in chewing. Masticator space abscesses are typically caused by infection with bacteria, and they can be very serious if not treated promptly.

A chronic hematoma is a collection of blood that has clotted and become organized over time. Chronic hematomas can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in areas where there has been trauma or surgery. Chronic hematomas are typically benign (noncancerous), but they can sometimes cause symptoms such as pain, swelling, and infection.

In the case of the teenage girl, the most likely diagnosis is a chronic hematoma. This is because the lesion is well-defined, lobulated, and T2 hyperintense without mass effect, adjacent edema, or other invasive features. On gadolinium administration, there was sequential increased enhancement on the postcontrast T1-weighted axial images. Further imaging workup with single-proton emission computed tomography-CT (SPECT-CT) using technetium Tc 99m–labeled red blood cells demonstrated increased tracer pooling within the lesion. These findings are all consistent with a chronic hematoma.

A rhabdomyosarcoma would be more likely to be a solid mass with irregular borders and invasion of surrounding tissues. A venous malformation would be more likely to be a cystic mass with no enhancement on postcontrast images. A masticator space abscess would be more likely to be a complex mass with surrounding edema and inflammatory changes.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis in this case is a chronic hematoma.

 86%|████████▌ | 1315/1525 [5:01:19<54:10, 15.48s/it]The answer is: Adult rhabdomyoma (A).

Explanation:

Adult rhabdomyoma is a rare, benign tumor of skeletal muscle origin. It typically occurs in the head and neck, and is more common in women than men. The tumor is usually asymptomatic, but may cause dysphagia, dysphonia, or otalgia. On imaging, adult rhabdomyoma is a well-circumscribed, solid mass. Histologically, the tumor is composed of mature skeletal muscle cells. Immunohistochemical stains are positive for myogenin, desmin, and myoglobin.

In the case presented, the patient is a woman in her 50s who presented with dysphagia and frequent throat clearing. A right pyriform sinus mass was seen on fiber-optic laryngoscopy. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the finding of a hypopharyngeal mass. The patient underwent an endoscopic laser excision. Immunohistochemical stains revealed tumor cells that were focally positive for myogenin and diffusely positive for desmin and myoglobin. An MRI scan obtained 1 month postoperatively demonstrated a persistent mass or swelling. The patient continued to experience dysphagia, globus, and a choking sensation when coughing. On fiber-optic examination, right pyriform sinus fullness was visualized. During operative laryngoscopy, no mass was identified. An interval MRI demonstrated a 2-cm soft-tissue mass in the cervical esophagus. Using rigid suspension laryngoscopy, we identified a large, smooth-walled ovoid mass herniating from the cervical esophageal opening. A mucosal stalk anchored the mass to the lateral pyriform sinus wall. Endoscopic snare cautery was used to excise the mass. The tumor was well-defined, solitary, tan-red, and composed of sheets of large, round-to-polygonal cells with marked eosinophilic, granular cytoplasm. Most tumor cells exhibited peripherally or centrally located vesicular nuclei with prominent nucleoli. Peripheral intracellular vacuoles indenting the cytoplasm were seen, which represent a processing artifact due to intracellular glycogen loss.

The clinical presentation, imaging findings, and histopathology of the tumor are consistent with a diagnosis of adult rhabdomyoma. The other options are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation, imaging findings, and histopathology.

Explanation:

The patient is a man in his 50s who presented with a facial mass growing over 1 year, with 28.5-kg weight loss due to poor oral intake. He reported a 44–pack-year smoking history and remote alcohol abuse. On physical examination he had a 10-cm right-sided facial mass extending under the auricle from the mastoid to the zygoma and inferiorly to the angle of the mandible. The mass was firm, mildly tender, but without overlying skin changes or cervical lymphadenopathy. Computed tomographic (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans showed maxillary sinus compression with partial destruction of the zygomatic arch, mandible, and orbital floor. The mass extended into the right pterygopalatine fossa, disrupting the floor of the middle cranial fossa and widening the foramen ovale. A core biopsy specimen revealed spindle cell proliferation with abundant collagen that stained focally with CD34, smooth muscle actin, and Bcl-2. The Figure, C, shows a gross pathologic image after excision of the mass.

Histopathologic findings demonstrated spindle cells arranged in long fascicles with abundant interstitial collagen (Figure, D). Tumor cells exhibited central, oval nuclei, and moderate amounts of pale-pink cytoplasm with indistinct borders. There was no increased or atypical mitosis, necrosis, or vascular invasion. Immunostaining demonstrated strong nuclear staining for β-catenin antibody and was positive for smooth muscle actin antibody, while stains for desmin, pan-keratin, S-100, CD34, and Bcl-2 antibodies were negative. The Ki67 index was less than 1%.

The differential diagnosis for a spindle cell tumor of the head and neck includes a variety of benign and malignant neoplasms. The most common benign spindle cell tumors in this location are pleomorphic adenoma, desmoid tumor, and fibrosarcoma. Pleomorphic adenoma is a slow-growing, locally invasive tumor that is most commonly seen in the parotid gland. Desmoid tumors are rare, non-metastasizing mesenchymal tumors that are typically seen in young women. Fibrosarcoma is a malignant spindle cell tumor that is typically seen in older adults.

In this case, the patient's history of smoking and alcohol abuse, the location of the mass in the infratemporal fossa, and the histopathologic findings of a spindle cell tumor with abundant collagen and positive staining for β-catenin and smooth muscle actin are all consistent with a diagnosis of pleomorphic adenoma. Pleomorphic adenomas are typically treated with surgical excision. The prognosis for patients with pleomorphic adenoma is excellent, with a recurrence rate of less than 10%.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Desmoid tumors are rare, non-metastasizing mesenchymal tumors that are typically seen in young women. The patient in this case is a man in his 50s, which is not the typical age group for desmoid tumors. Additionally, the patient's history of smoking and alcohol abuse is a risk factor for pleomorphic adenoma, but not for desmoid tumors.
* Fibrosarcoma is a malignant spindle cell tumor that is typically seen in older adults. The patient in this case is a man in his 50s, which is the typical age group for fibrosarcoma. However, the patient's history of smoking and alcohol abuse is a risk factor for pleomorphic adenoma, but not for fibrosarcoma. Additionally, the histopathologic findings of a spindle cell tumor with abundant collagen and positive staining for β-catenin and smooth muscle actin are more consistent with a diagnosis of pleomorphic adenoma than with a diagnosis of fibrosarcoma.
* Rhabdomyosarcoma is a malignant soft tissue tumor that is typically seen in children. The patient in this case is a man in his 50s, which is not the typical age group for rhabdomyosarcoma. Additionally, the patient's history of smoking and alcohol abuse is not a risk factor for rhabdomyosarcoma.

Explanation:

The patient presented with a large, symptomatic, left adrenal mass. The CT scan showed a 12 × 13 × 11-cm mass, which is consistent with an adrenal myelolipoma. Adrenal myelolipomas are benign tumors that are composed of fat, bone marrow, and hematopoietic elements. They are the most common type of adrenal tumor, accounting for up to 50% of all adrenal masses. They are typically asymptomatic, but can cause symptoms if they are large enough to compress surrounding structures. The most common symptom is abdominal pain, which can be sharp or dull and is often associated with nausea and vomiting. Other symptoms may include fever, weight loss, and fatigue. The diagnosis of an adrenal myelolipoma is made on imaging studies, such as CT or MRI. The treatment is usually observation, but surgery may be necessary if the mass is large or causing symptoms.

The other options are incorrect because they are not consistent with the patient's presentation. Adrenal liposarcoma is a rare, malignant tumor that is composed of fat cells. It is typically diagnosed in older adults and is associated with a poor prognosis. Renal hamartoma is a benign tumor that is composed of abnormal renal tissue. It is typically diagnosed in children and is usually asymptomatic. Nonfunctional paraganglioma is a rare, malignant tumor that is composed of paraganglionic cells.

Explanation:

A GIST is a mesenchymal tumor that arises from the interstitial cells of Cajal, which are pacemaker cells in the gastrointestinal tract. GISTs are typically found in the stomach, small intestine, and colon, but can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract. They are most common in adults over the age of 50, and are more common in men than women.

The most common symptom of a GIST is abdominal pain. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, weight loss, and bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract. GISTs can also cause obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract.

Diagnosis of a GIST is made with imaging studies, such as CT scan or MRI, and biopsy. Treatment of a GIST depends on the size and location of the tumor, as well as the patient's overall health. Surgical removal is the preferred treatment for localized GISTs. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy may be used to treat advanced GISTs.

The prognosis for patients with GIST is good, with most patients surviving for at least 5 years after diagnosis. However, the prognosis for patients with advanced GIST is poor, with most patients dying within 5 years of diagnosis.

The other options are incorrect because they are not the most likely diagnosis for a patient with the given history and presentation. A leiomyosarcoma is a type of soft tissue sarcoma that can occur anywhere in the body, but is most common in the uterus. A pancreatic pseudocyst is a fluid-filled sac that can form in the pancreas, usually as a complication of pancreatitis. A gastric duplication is a rare congenital anomaly that occurs when a portion of the stomach develops in an abnormal location.

The patient has a history of open-angle glaucoma in her right eye, which is a serious condition that can lead to blindness if not treated. The presence of longer, thicker eyelashes on the right side compared with the left, as well as iris heterochromia, are both concerning signs that may indicate an underlying medical condition. It is important to rule out any serious causes of these findings, such as tumors or inflammation, as soon as possible. An ophthalmologist is a specialist in eye care who can perform a thorough examination of the patient's eyes and provide the best possible care.

A: Performing eye and orbit computed tomography (CT) is not necessary at this time, as it is not a sensitive or specific test for the conditions that may be causing the patient's symptoms.

B: Ordering serologic studies, including erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), antinuclear antibody (ANA) titers, complete blood cell count (CBC), and basic chemistry panel, may be helpful in the workup of some patients with iris heterochromia and eyelash hypertrichosis, but these tests are not necessary in this case. The patient's history and physical examination are more concerning for a local ocular problem than a systemic disorder.

C: Reassuring the patient without further evaluation is not appropriate in this case. The patient has a history of a serious eye condition and is now presenting with new, concerning symptoms. It is important to rule out any serious causes of these findings as soon as possible.

 87%|████████▋ | 1320/1525 [5:02:35<48:28, 14.19s/it]The correct answer is: B. Obtain a biopsy of the skin lesion.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP), a type of hypersensitivity reaction that can occur after exposure to inhaled antigens. HP is characterized by fever, cough, dyspnea, and skin lesions. The skin lesions are typically erythematous macules and papules that occur on the upper trunk and extremities.

The chest radiograph shows bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, which is a common finding in HP. The computed tomography of the abdomen shows right-sided hydronephrosis, which is a possible complication of HP.

The next step in the management of this patient is to obtain a biopsy of the skin lesion. The biopsy will help to confirm the diagnosis of HP and determine the specific antigen that is causing the reaction. Once the antigen has been identified, the patient can be desensitized to the antigen.

A, C, and D are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate next steps in the management of this patient. Topical corticosteroids are not effective in the treatment of HP. Oral antibiotics are not indicated in the treatment of HP, unless there is a co-existing infection. Respiratory isolation is not necessary in the treatment of HP.

The patient's symptoms and laboratory tests suggest that he may have androgen deficiency. However, the diagnosis of androgen deficiency cannot be made based on a single total testosterone measurement. The total testosterone level can be affected by a number of factors, including age, body mass index, and medications. Therefore, it is important to repeat the total testosterone measurement using an immunoassay, which is a more accurate test. If the repeat total testosterone level is still low, then further evaluation, such as measuring gonadotropins and free testosterone, may be necessary.

A. The patient has androgen deficiency; measure gonadotropins. is incorrect because the diagnosis of androgen deficiency cannot be made based on a single total testosterone measurement.

C. Further evaluation is required; measure free testosterone. is incorrect because the measurement of free testosterone is not necessary if the total testosterone level is low.

D. The patient has androgen deficiency; no further evaluation is required. is incorrect because the diagnosis of androgen deficiency cannot be made based on a single total testosterone measurement.

The patient's history of taking propylthiouracil (PTU) and the development of painful lesions involving both ears after starting PTU therapy are consistent with a diagnosis of propylthiouracil-induced hypersensitivity vasculitis. The histopathologic findings of leukocytoclastic vasculitis and fibrin thrombi are also consistent with this diagnosis.

Levamisole-induced vasculopathy is a rare condition that can occur after treatment with levamisole, a medication used to treat parasitic infections. The lesions of levamisole-induced vasculopathy are typically located on the lower extremities and are not associated with a history of taking PTU.

Mixed cryoglobulinemia is a condition characterized by the presence of cryoglobulins, which are immunoglobulins that precipitate in the cold. Cryoglobulinemia can cause a variety of symptoms, including purpura, arthralgia, and Raynaud's phenomenon. The lesions of mixed cryoglobulinemia are typically located on the extremities and are not associated with a history of taking PTU.

Septic vasculitis is a rare condition that can occur as a complication of sepsis. The lesions of septic vasculitis are typically located on the lower extremities and are associated with fever, chills, and other signs of sepsis. The patient in this case does not have any evidence of sepsis.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is propylthiouracil-induced hypersensitivity vasculitis.

Explanation:

The patient's presentation is most consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis, a small vessel vasculitis characterized by inflammation and necrosis of the blood vessel walls. This can lead to the formation of stellate red-brown patches on the skin, as well as other symptoms such as fever, arthralgia, and myalgia.

Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) are both systemic vasculitides that can involve the skin. However, they are typically associated with more severe systemic symptoms, such as glomerulonephritis, pulmonary hemorrhage, and central nervous system involvement. The patient in this case does not have any of these symptoms, making GPA and MPA less likely diagnoses.

Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) is a medium vessel vasculitis that can also involve the skin. However, it is typically associated with palpable purpura, which is not present in this patient. Additionally, PAN is more common in men than women.

The histopathologic findings in the patient's biopsy are also consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis. The biopsy shows a perivascular infiltrate of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and eosinophils, as well as fibrinoid necrosis of the blood vessel walls.

In conclusion, the patient's presentation and histopathologic findings are most consistent with leukocytoclastic vasculitis.

Explanation:
The patient is a man in his 30s with no medical history of illness who presents with a lesion of concern on his left scalp. The lesion has slowly enlarged over the preceding 5 years. The patient denies a history of trauma prior to its development. The patient denies any spontaneous bleeding, crusting, or itching, and he is primarily concerned about its growth. There is no personal or family history of malignancy. On physical examination, the patient's left frontal scalp reveals a mobile 1.2-cm mammillated, soft, brown plaque with protruding terminal hairs. The remainder of the patient's skin examination reveals no other concerning lesions. There is no lymphadenopathy present. Dermoscopically, the lesion is characterized by irregular pigment globules, milialike cysts, and focal arborizing vessels. A shave biopsy was performed for histopathologic examination, which revealed a basal cell carcinoma.

Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common type of skin cancer, accounting for 70% of all skin cancers. It is a slow-growing tumor that rarely spreads to other parts of the body. BCC can develop on any part of the skin, but it is most common on the face, head, and neck. The most common symptom of BCC is a small, raised bump on the skin that may be pearly or translucent. BCC can also appear as a red, scaly patch or a sore that does not heal.

The diagnosis of BCC is made by a dermatologist after a physical examination and a biopsy. A biopsy is a procedure in which a small piece of tissue is removed from the lesion and examined under a microscope. The treatment of BCC depends on the size, location, and type of tumor. Small BCCs can often be treated with surgery, freezing, or radiation therapy. Larger BCCs may require a combination of treatments.

The prognosis for BCC is excellent with early diagnosis and treatment. Most people with BCC are cured with treatment. However, if BCC is not treated, it can grow larger and spread to other parts of the body. This can be serious, but it is rare.

The other options are incorrect because they do not fit the clinical presentation of the patient. Acne is a common skin condition that causes pimples and blackheads. It is most common in adolescents, but it can affect people of all ages. Apocrine poroma is a rare skin tumor that occurs in the sweat glands. It is most common in middle-aged and older adults. Congenital nevi are moles that are present at birth. They are usually benign, but they can sometimes become cancerous. Seborrheic keratosis is a common skin condition that causes rough, scaly patches on the skin. It is most common in older adults.

Explanation:
The most likely diagnosis in this case is frontotemporal dementia (FTD). This is supported by the patient's history of progressive personality changes, gait dysfunction, and motoric problems, as well as the findings on neurological examination and imaging studies.

FTD is a group of neurodegenerative disorders that primarily affect the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. It is the second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer's disease. The symptoms of FTD can vary depending on the specific subtype of the disorder, but they often include personality changes, social withdrawal, apathy, changes in behavior, and difficulty with executive functions such as planning and decision-making. Motor problems, such as gait disturbance and rigidity, can also occur.

There is no cure for FTD, but there are treatments that can help to manage the symptoms. Treatment may include medications, therapy, and lifestyle changes.

The other possible diagnoses in this case are all neurodegenerative disorders that can cause dementia, but they are less likely than FTD. Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia, but it typically causes more memory problems than personality changes or motor problems. Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD) are both rare disorders that can cause similar symptoms to FTD, but they are more likely to cause parkinsonian features such as tremor and rigidity.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis in this case is FTD. This is supported by the patient's history, examination findings, and imaging studies.

The patient has a history of choroidal melanoma of the left eye, which was treated with iodine 125 plaque brachytherapy 4½ years ago. The tumor decreased in height and visual acuity remained stable. At her last follow-up, she had a 4.5 × 3.0-mm bluish black flat lesion on the sclera. Results of a dilated fundus examination showed a grayish black, minimally elevated choroidal lesion with surrounding retinal pigment epithelial atrophy but without subretinal fluid, hemorrhage, or hard exudates.

The most likely explanation for the new pigmented lesion is that it is a radiation scar. Radiation scars are common after treatment for choroidal melanoma and are usually benign. They can be difficult to distinguish from recurrent tumor, however, so it is important to monitor them closely.

In this case, the patient has no evidence of tumor recurrence. Her visual acuity is stable and there is no evidence of subretinal fluid, hemorrhage, or hard exudates. The new pigmented lesion is small and flat, which are also features of radiation scars. Therefore, the most appropriate management is to observe the lesion closely with serial imaging. If the lesion grows or changes in appearance, further treatment may be necessary.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Repeat iodine 125 plaque brachytherapy is not necessary because the patient has no evidence of tumor recurrence.
* External beam radiotherapy is not necessary because the patient has no evidence of tumor recurrence.
* Enucleation is not necessary because the patient has no evidence of tumor recurrence and her visual acuity is stable.

Chloroquine retinopathy is a rare but serious side effect of chloroquine treatment. It is characterized by progressive loss of vision, which can eventually lead to blindness. The risk of developing chloroquine retinopathy increases with the cumulative dose of chloroquine taken.

The best way to prevent chloroquine retinopathy is to avoid taking chloroquine in high doses for long periods of time. If chloroquine is necessary, it is important to monitor the patient's vision closely for signs of retinopathy.

If chloroquine retinopathy is diagnosed, the only treatment is to discontinue chloroquine treatment. In some cases, the vision may improve after chloroquine is stopped. However, in most cases, the vision loss is permanent.

The other options are incorrect because:

* Reassurance and observation is not an appropriate treatment for chloroquine retinopathy. The vision loss caused by chloroquine retinopathy is progressive and irreversible.
* Intravitreous corticosteroids are not effective in treating chloroquine retinopathy.
* There is no evidence that family members of patients with chloroquine retinopathy are at increased risk of developing the condition.

CJRP is a rare, chronic, papulosquamous eruption of unknown etiology that typically affects children and young adults. It is characterized by well-defined, follicular, pink, scaly papules that coalesce into thin plaques on the elbows, knees, hands, and feet. The palms and soles may also be involved, with diffuse, marked orange-red hyperkeratosis and hyperlinearity. Initial treatment is with topical corticosteroids, but systemic therapy may be necessary in severe cases.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Psoriasis is a chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by well-defined, erythematous, scaly plaques. The plaques are typically found on the elbows, knees, scalp, and lower back. Psoriasis is not typically associated with hyperkeratosis of the palms and soles.
* Ichthyosis is a group of genetic disorders characterized by dry, scaly skin. The scales are typically larger and more widespread than those seen in CJRP. Ichthyosis is not typically associated with hyperkeratosis of the palms and soles.
* Atopic dermatitis is a chronic, inflammatory skin condition characterized by itching, redness, and scaling. Atopic dermatitis is not typically associated with hyperkeratosis of the palms and soles.

Explanation:
The patient is a preteen boy who presented with a 1-year history of right-sided nasal obstruction and a 4-day history of intermittent right-sided epistaxis following blunt trauma to the nose. The epistaxis occurred 3 to 4 times a day and resolved with pressure. He did not have facial pain, facial paresthesia, or visual changes. There was no family or personal history of bleeding disorders. Nasal endoscopy revealed a large, well-vascularized, polypoid mass filling the right anterior nasal cavity. A computed tomographic scan showed a right nasal cavity mass (4.5 × 1.7 cm) extending to the posterior choana with opacification and bony remodeling of the right maxillary sinus. The mass had heterogeneous intermediate signal intensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging. The patient was taken to the operating room for biopsy and possible excision of the nasal mass. As the lesion was biopsied, there was brisk bleeding. However, the lesion was found to have a narrow pedicle of attachment and was resected in its entirety. The mass was based on the superior aspect of the nasal septum and cribriform plate. Hematoxylin-eosin stain showed a sheet-like proliferation of epithelioid and polygonal cells with pale eosinophilic granular cytoplasm and relatively uniform vesicular nuclei. The cells were arranged in nests. Branching, staghorn-like blood vessels were scattered throughout the tumor. The tumor cells stained positive for smooth muscle actin, muscle specific actin, Bcl-2, INI-1, and transcription factor E3.

Given the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging findings, the most likely diagnosis is JNA. JNA is a benign, locally aggressive tumor that occurs almost exclusively in adolescent boys. It is thought to arise from the perineural spaces of the sphenopalatine ganglion. JNA is characterized by its rapid growth, profuse bleeding, and tendency to invade local structures. The tumor is typically diagnosed with nasal endoscopy and biopsy. Treatment of JNA is surgical excision. Radiation therapy may be used in cases where the tumor is incompletely resected or has recurred. The prognosis for patients with JNA is good, with most patients achieving long-term remission after surgery.

The other options are not as likely in this case. Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma is a malignant tumor of skeletal muscle that typically occurs in children. Nasal alveolar soft part sarcoma is a rare, malignant tumor that occurs in adults. Malignant melanoma is a malignant tumor of melanocytes that can occur anywhere in the body, including the nose.

**Explanation:**

Chondrodermatitis nodularis chronica helicis (CNCH) is a chronic, painful, nodular skin condition that affects the helix of the ear. It is most common in men over the age of 50. The cause of CNCH is unknown, but it is thought to be caused by repeated trauma to the ear, such as from wearing a hat or headphones.

The characteristic lesion of CNCH is a small, dome-shaped nodule that is tender to the touch. The nodule is usually red and may have a central crust or ulcer. CNCH can be diagnosed based on the appearance of the lesions and the patient's history.

There is no cure for CNCH, but the condition can be treated with topical steroids or surgery. Topical steroids can help to reduce inflammation and pain. Surgery may be necessary to remove the nodule if it is large or painful.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not describe the patient's condition. Keratoacanthoma is a rapidly growing skin cancer that usually appears as a single, dome-shaped nodule. Glomus tumor is a benign tumor that arises from the glomus body, a small sensory organ in the skin. Rheumatoid nodule is a type of nodule that occurs in people with rheumatoid arthritis.

Explanation:
The most likely diagnosis is osteolipoma, a benign tumor that is composed of both bone and fat. The patient's history of a slow-growing, nontender mass that is sensitive to cold liquids is consistent with this diagnosis. The CT scan findings of a well-defined, hyperdense, mildly heterogeneous mass with few focal areas of fat attenuation along the inferior aspect of the lesion are also consistent with osteolipoma. The patient's age, gender, and lack of other medical problems are also consistent with this diagnosis.

Myositis ossificans is a rare disorder in which muscle tissue becomes ossified, or turned into bone. It is most commonly seen in young men and is often associated with trauma. The patient's history and physical examination findings are not consistent with myositis ossificans.

Liposarcoma is a rare type of cancer that arises from fat cells. It is most commonly seen in adults and is often associated with obesity. The patient's history and physical examination findings are not consistent with liposarcoma.

Calcified teratoma/dermoid is a type of tumor that can contain a variety of tissues, including bone, fat, hair, and teeth.

The patient is a previously healthy woman in her 50s who presented with complaints of increasing forgetfulness, fatigue, and depressed mood after dealing with the deaths of several close relatives. She was diagnosed with depression and began treatment with antidepressant medication. After 8 months, she had worsening complaints. At that time, a family member reported that her memory problems had progressed. She was no longer able to find misplaced objects, remember appointments, or handle financial affairs. She was often subdued, her mood depressed, and her sleeping time increased. Clinical examination at that time revealed a flattened affect and a 22 of 30 Mini-Mental State Examination score. Findings were otherwise normal, and there were no focal neurologic deficits. Basic laboratory workup results were unremarkable. She was referred to a neurologist, who ordered contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. The MRI revealed extensive ill-defined areas of FLAIR (fluid-attenuated inversion recovery) and T2 signal abnormalities with additional enhancing nodular foci located within deep white matter structures, the basal ganglia, the caudate, the pons, and the midbrain. Also identified was enhancement of the interpeduncular cistern and cerebral peduncles, suggestive of leptomeningeal involvement.

The imaging findings are most consistent with a diagnosis of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL). PCNSL is a rare, aggressive form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that arises in the brain. It is most common in older adults, and is more common in men than women. The most common presenting symptoms of PCNSL are headache, seizures, and focal neurologic deficits. Diagnosis is made with a brain biopsy. Treatment typically involves a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. The prognosis for PCNSL is poor, with a median survival of only 12-18 months.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely based on the patient's history, presentation, and imaging findings. Inflammatory demyelinating processes such as multiple sclerosis (MS) can cause white matter lesions on MRI, but they are typically more scattered and less well-defined than the lesions seen in PCNSL. Neoplasms such as multicentric glioma, glioblastoma multiforme, and metastases can also cause white matter lesions on MRI, but they are typically associated with more mass effect and edema than the lesions seen in PCNSL. Infectious causes including tuberculosis, neurosyphilis, and toxoplasmosis can also cause white matter lesions on MRI, but they are typically associated with other clinical features such as fever, headache, and meningismus.

Explanation: The patient's history and presentation are consistent with a spinal dural arteriovenous fistula (SDAVF). SDAVFs are rare vascular malformations that occur when abnormal connections develop between arteries and veins within the spinal dura mater. These connections can cause high-flow blood to shunt through the spinal cord, leading to ischemia and neurological symptoms.

The patient's symptoms of episodic numbness and paresthesias in both feet, urinary retention, and hyperreflexia are all consistent with spinal cord ischemia. The MRI scan shows a blurry spinal cord signal alteration at the T7-T8 level with deformation of the cord posteriorly. This is consistent with the presence of a mass lesion compressing the spinal cord.

A dynamic computed tomographic myelogram demonstrated a lesion compressing the dorsal spinal cord at the T7 level. This finding is also consistent with the diagnosis of an SDAVF.

The other possible diagnoses are not supported by the patient's history and presentation. Anterior thoracolumbar spinal cord herniation would typically cause symptoms of lower extremity weakness and bowel and bladder dysfunction. Malignant neoplasm of the spinal cord would typically cause symptoms of progressive weakness, numbness, and paresthesias in the legs. Spinal extradural arachnoid cyst would typically cause symptoms of back pain and radicular pain in the legs.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a spinal dural arteriovenous fistula.

Acute cholecystitis is a common cause of acute abdominal pain. It is caused by inflammation of the gallbladder, which is a small, pear-shaped organ that stores bile. Bile is a fluid that helps the body digest fats.

The most common symptom of acute cholecystitis is pain in the right upper abdomen. The pain is often severe and can radiate to the back or shoulder. Other symptoms may include fever, nausea, vomiting, and jaundice.

Acute cholecystitis is usually diagnosed with a physical examination and imaging tests, such as an ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) scan. Treatment usually involves surgery to remove the gallbladder.

The other options are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms.

B) Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis is a rare, chronic form of cholecystitis that is characterized by the accumulation of cholesterol deposits in the gallbladder wall. It is often associated with systemic diseases, such as diabetes and Crohn's disease. The symptoms of xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis are similar to those of acute cholecystitis, but the pain is often more severe. Treatment usually involves surgery to remove the gallbladder.

C) Gallbladder cancer is a rare cancer that starts in the gallbladder. The most common symptom of gallbladder cancer is pain in the right upper abdomen. Other symptoms may include weight loss, fever, and jaundice. Gallbladder cancer is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, and the prognosis is poor. Treatment usually involves surgery to remove the gallbladder, followed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

D) Adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder is a benign condition that occurs when the glands in the gallbladder wall become enlarged and inflamed. The symptoms of adenomyomatosis of the gallbladder are similar to those of acute cholecystitis, but the pain is often less severe. Treatment usually involves surgery to remove the gallbladder.

Explanation:

D-dimer is a protein fragment that is produced when blood clots break down. A D-dimer test is used to help diagnose blood clots, such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).

A positive D-dimer test does not necessarily mean that a person has a blood clot. However, a negative D-dimer test is very good at ruling out a blood clot.

In this case, the patient's D-dimer test result is positive. This suggests that she may have a blood clot. However, the test result is not definitive. To confirm the diagnosis, the patient will need to have further testing, such as a CT scan or pulmonary angiography.

Options B, C, and D are incorrect because they do not accurately reflect the results of the patient's D-dimer test.

Explanation:
The most likely diagnosis is tibial stress fracture. This is a common injury in adolescents who participate in high-impact sports, such as basketball. The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with this diagnosis. Radiographs may be normal in the early stages of a tibial stress fracture, so further imaging, such as a bone scan or MRI, may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

Treatment for tibial stress fracture typically includes rest, ice, compression, and elevation (RICE). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be used to help control pain and inflammation. In some cases, immobilization with a cast or brace may be necessary. Most patients with tibial stress fracture make a full recovery with conservative treatment.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Obtaining laboratory work to assess for nutritional or hormonal abnormalities would not be helpful in the diagnosis or treatment of tibial stress fracture. Refering for immediate surgery is not necessary for most patients with tibial stress fracture. Immobilization with non–weight-bearing activity may be necessary in some cases, but it is not the first-line treatment for tibial stress fracture.

The patient has a history of bronchiectasis, which is a chronic lung disease characterized by the destruction of the airways. This can lead to infection, which can cause a rash. The patient also has a purpuric plaque on the right medial ankle and dorsal foot, with central vesicles. This is a characteristic finding of ecthyma gangrenosum, which is a serious skin infection that can occur in patients with bronchiectasis. Ecthyma gangrenosum is often caused by gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus. Therefore, the patient should be treated with intravenous antibiotics, such as vancomycin.

The other answers are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option B: Performing a herpes simplex virus/varicella zoster virus direct fluorescent antibody test and empirically treating with valacyclovir is not the best approach in this case. Herpes simplex virus and varicella zoster virus are not the most likely causes of ecthyma gangrenosum in a patient with bronchiectasis.
* Option C: Obtaining antineutrophilic cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) titers is not the best approach in this case. ANCA is a marker of autoimmune diseases, such as Wegener granulomatosis and Churg-Strauss syndrome. These diseases are not the most likely causes of ecthyma gangrenosum in a patient with bronchiectasis.
* Option D: Starting a high-potency topical steroid is not the best approach in this case. A high-potency topical steroid may be helpful for treating a mild skin rash, but it is not the best approach for treating ecthyma gangrenosum. Ecthyma gangrenosum is a serious skin infection that requires treatment with antibiotics.

Indeterminate cell histiocytosis is a rare, non-Langerhans cell histiocytic disorder characterized by the presence of CD4-positive, CD8-negative, CD1a-negative, and S-100 protein-negative histiocytes in the skin and other organs. It is most commonly diagnosed in children and young adults, but can occur at any age. The clinical presentation is variable, but most patients present with a skin rash characterized by papules, plaques, and nodules. Other organ involvement can include the lymph nodes, liver, spleen, and bone marrow. The diagnosis of indeterminate cell histiocytosis is made by skin biopsy, which shows the characteristic histiocytes. Treatment is generally supportive, with corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents being used in some cases. The prognosis is generally good, with most patients achieving remission with treatment.

The other options are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation. Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disease that can affect the skin, but it typically presents with non-specific symptoms such as fever, fatigue, and weight loss. Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection that can cause a skin rash, but it typically presents with a chancre, which is a painless ulcer at the site of infection. Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the T-cells, but it typically presents with lymphadenopathy, fever, and weight loss.

Explanation:

Paraneoplastic pemphigus is a rare, autoimmune blistering disorder that can occur in association with a variety of underlying malignancies, most commonly non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The disease is characterized by the development of flaccid bullae and erosions on the skin and mucous membranes. Histopathologic examination typically shows suprabasal acantholysis, a characteristic finding in paraneoplastic pemphigus. Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) testing of perilesional skin shows IgG and C3 deposition at the basement membrane zone. Indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) testing of serum against rodent epithelium is also positive in most cases.

In the case presented, the patient has a history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and presents with a blistering erythematous eruption and painful oral lesions. Histopathologic examination shows suprabasal acantholysis, and DIF testing is positive for IgG and C3 deposition at the basement membrane zone. IIF testing of serum against rodent epithelium is also positive. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of paraneoplastic pemphigus.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Bullous pemphigoid is a chronic autoimmune blistering disorder that is not associated with malignancy.
* Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a severe, life-threatening mucocutaneous reaction that is typically caused by an allergic reaction to medication or an infection.
* Pemphigus vulgaris is a chronic autoimmune blistering disorder that is characterized by the development of flaccid bullae on the skin and mucous membranes.

 88%|████████▊ | 1341/1525 [5:07:23<43:53, 14.31s/it]The answer is **B: Tumid lupus erythematosus**.

Explanation:

The patient has a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which is a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect many different parts of the body, including the skin, joints, kidneys, and heart. One of the characteristic skin lesions of SLE is tumid lupus erythematosus, which is a raised, tender nodule that is often associated with inflammation of the surrounding skin.

In this case, the patient developed tender erythematous nodules after undergoing right knee arthroscopy. These lesions are consistent with tumid lupus erythematosus, as they are located in a typical area (the knee) and are associated with a history of SLE. Additionally, the lesions are tender to palpation, which is a characteristic of tumid lupus erythematosus.

The other possible diagnoses are not as likely in this case. Cellulitis is a bacterial infection of the skin and underlying tissues that is typically characterized by redness, swelling, warmth, and pain. In this case, the patient's lesions are not associated with these typical features of cellulitis. Gyrate erythema is a rare skin condition that is characterized by a swirling pattern of erythematous plaques. In this case, the patient's lesions are not in a swirling pattern. Erythema nodosum is a skin condition that is characterized by tender, red nodules that are often associated with inflammation of the joints. In this case, the patient's lesions are not associated with inflammation of the joints.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is tumid lupus erythematosus.

Explanation:

Enucleation is the surgical removal of an eye. It is typically performed to remove a cancerous or diseased eye, or to relieve pain from an eye that is no longer functional. In the case of the patient described in the question, the mass obscuring the globe is likely a tumor. Tumors can be benign or malignant, and malignant tumors can spread to other parts of the body. Therefore, the best course of treatment in this case is to remove the eye with the tumor.

Computed tomographic (CT) scans of the orbit are often used to evaluate tumors of the eye and orbit. However, in this case, the diagnosis of a tumor is already clear, and a CT scan would not provide any additional information.

Testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is not indicated in this case. HIV is a virus that attacks the immune system, and it can lead to the development of AIDS. However, there is no evidence that the patient in the question has HIV, and testing for HIV would not change the course of treatment.

 88%|████████▊ | 1343/1525 [5:07:43<37:00, 12.20s/it]The correct answer is **B**. Consider a diagnosis of choroidal metastasis.

The patient is a 38-year-old woman with a history of stage II breast carcinoma with positive lymph nodes, which was diagnosed and treated 5 years prior. Subsequent annual metastatic surveillance test results had been negative for recurrence. She developed acute painless blurred vision in her right eye 3 weeks after receiving a single injection of corticosteroid in her deltoid for stenosing tenosynovitis.

The patient's history, physical examination, and ophthalmologic findings are consistent with choroidal metastasis. The most common cause of choroidal metastasis is breast carcinoma, followed by lung carcinoma, melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma. The risk of choroidal metastasis is increased in patients with a history of systemic cancer, particularly those with metastatic disease to other organs.

The diagnosis of choroidal metastasis is made by ophthalmologic examination, including funduscopy, fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography (OCT). Funduscopy typically reveals a solitary or multiple, well-defined, yellowish-white choroidal lesions. Fluorescein angiography shows early hypofluorescence and late hyperfluorescence of the lesions. OCT shows a thickened choroid with disruption of the normal choroidal architecture.

The management of choroidal metastasis is typically palliative. Treatment options include observation, local therapy with corticosteroids or laser photocoagulation, and systemic therapy with chemotherapy or radiation therapy. The prognosis for patients with choroidal metastasis is poor, with a median survival of 6-12 months.

The other options are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's presentation and findings. Multifocal central serous chorioretinopathy is a non-neoplastic condition that typically affects young, healthy adults. Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome is a systemic autoimmune disease that can cause chorioretinitis, but it is typically associated with other symptoms, such as headache, tinnitus, and hearing loss. Syphilitic chorioretinitis is a rare complication of syphilis that typically occurs in patients with untreated or inadequately treated syphilis.

Explanation:

The child's history of sudden onset of brittle nails with cracks followed by painless sloughing of nails, which initially affected only the fingernails but soon involved the toenails, is consistent with the diagnosis of drug-induced nail changes. The semilunar whitish grooves in the middle of the nail plate (Beau's lines) and the transverse partial cracks of the proximal nail plate with distal onycholysis (Muehrcke's lines) are characteristic findings of drug-induced nail changes.

The most common drugs that can cause nail changes include chemotherapy drugs, retinoids, and penicillamine. In this case, the child's mother reported that she had recently started taking a new medication for her acne. It is possible that this medication was the cause of the child's nail changes.

Vaccination reactions, Kawasaki syndrome, and hand-foot-and-mouth disease are not typically associated with nail changes. Therefore, these diagnoses are less likely in this case.

Explanation:
The patient in the case has a heterogeneous tumor with small, angulated, blue cells with hyperchromatic nuclei, apoptosis, and mitosis, malignant glands lined by cuboidal cells with round nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and eosinophilic cytoplasm. The glands had luminal mucin production. Focally, there were also scattered round cells with abundant eosinophilic, refractile cytoplasm, features of rhabdomyoblasts. These latter cells were strongly positive for desmin and myogenin.

The most likely diagnosis is alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. This is a rare, aggressive soft tissue sarcoma that most commonly occurs in children and young adults. It is characterized by the presence of rhabdomyoblasts, which are cells that resemble developing skeletal muscle cells. Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma is typically diagnosed by biopsy, which shows the presence of rhabdomyoblasts. The tumor is then staged based on its size, location, and whether it has spread to other parts of the body.

Treatment for alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma typically involves a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In some cases, surgery may also be necessary to remove the tumor. The prognosis for patients with alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma varies depending on the stage of the disease at diagnosis. With treatment, the overall survival rate for children with alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma is approximately 70%.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely based on the patient's presentation and the findings on biopsy. Olfactory neuroblastoma is a rare tumor that arises from the olfactory epithelium in the nasal cavity. It is most commonly diagnosed in children and young adults. Sinonasal teratocarcinosarcoma is a very rare tumor that arises from the sinonasal region. It is a highly malignant tumor that is often diagnosed at an advanced stage. Small cell carcinoma is a type of lung cancer that can also occur in other parts of the body, including the sinonasal region. It is a highly aggressive tumor that is often diagnosed at an advanced stage.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for the patient in the case is alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. This is a rare, aggressive soft tissue sarcoma that most commonly occurs in children and young adults. It is characterized by the presence of rhabdomyoblasts, which are cells that resemble developing skeletal muscle cells. Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma is typically diagnosed by biopsy, which shows the presence of rhabdomyoblasts. The tumor is then staged based on its size, location, and whether it has spread to other parts of the body. Treatment for alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma typically involves a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In some cases, surgery may also be necessary to remove the tumor. The prognosis for patients with alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma varies depending on the stage of the disease at diagnosis. With treatment, the overall survival rate for children with alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma is approximately 70%.

Explanation:

The patient is a woman in her 50s who presented with an 8-week history of increasing headache, hyposmia, hypogeusia, and nasal congestion. Endoscopic nasopharyngoscopy revealed a large polypoid nasal mass occupying the left nasal roof and completely obstructing the nasal passage. Contrast-enhanced T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed a 1.7 × 3.5 × 2.6-cm soft-tissue mass within the left ethmoid cavity, eroding through the cribriform plate with adjacent dural enhancement. Intraoperative pathologic examination showed polypoid spindle cell proliferation. Histopathologic findings showed respiratory epithelium with submucosal vascular proliferation with no atypia among the lining endothelial cells. The Figure, B, shows a central vessel surrounded by lobules of endothelial lined capillaries. The Figure, C, highlights the endothelial cells of the numerous capillaries and the central vessel.

The most likely diagnosis is juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma (JNA). JNA is a rare, benign vascular tumor that occurs almost exclusively in adolescent and young adult males. It is typically located in the nasopharynx, but can also extend into the nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, orbit, and intracranial cavity. JNA is a highly vascular tumor that can cause significant bleeding and local destruction. The diagnosis is usually made based on clinical presentation and imaging findings. Histopathologic examination shows a proliferation of spindle cells with a prominent vascular component. JNA is treated with surgery, radiation therapy, or a combination of both. The prognosis is generally good, with most patients achieving long-term control of the disease.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Lobular capillary hemangioma is a benign vascular tumor that can occur in any age group. It is typically located in the skin, but can also occur in other organs. Lobular capillary hemangioma is a well-circumscribed tumor that is composed of small, round capillaries. It is usually treated with surgery or laser therapy.
* Inverting papilloma is a benign epithelial tumor that occurs in the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses. It is typically seen in older adults. Inverting papilloma is a polypoid tumor that is composed of inverted respiratory epithelium. It is usually treated with surgery.
* Respiratory epithelial adenomatoid hamartoma is a rare, benign tumor that occurs in the lung. It is typically seen in children.

Explanation:

Osteochondroma is a benign bone tumor that arises from the growth plate of a long bone. It is the most common benign bone tumor, accounting for 25% of all benign bone tumors. Osteochondromas are usually solitary lesions, but they can be multiple in patients with hereditary multiple exostoses (HME).

Osteochondromas typically present in children and adolescents. They are usually asymptomatic, but they can cause pain, swelling, and deformity. Osteochondromas are diagnosed on imaging studies, such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRI scans.

Osteochondromas are treated by surgical excision. The goal of surgery is to remove the tumor completely and to preserve as much normal bone as possible.

The other options are incorrect because:

* Exuberant osteophytes are benign bone growths that can occur on the surface of joints. They are usually caused by osteoarthritis. Exuberant osteophytes are not associated with obstructive sleep apnea.
* Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) is a condition characterized by the formation of bone spurs on the spine. DISH is not associated with obstructive sleep apnea.

The most likely diagnosis is pleomorphic adenoma, a benign mixed tumor of salivary glands. This is supported by the patient's history of a gradually enlarging soft palate mass, the physical examination findings of a firm, nontender, submucosal posterior soft palate mass, the imaging findings of a well-circumscribed solid lesion with no evidence of infiltration of soft-tissue structures, the pterygopalatine fossa, or palatine nerve foramina, and the pathologic findings of a mixed tumor with epithelial, myoepithelial, and mesenchymal components.

Mucoepidermoid carcinoma is a malignant epithelial tumor of salivary glands. It is the most common malignant tumor of the parotid gland, but it is rare in the soft palate. The patient's history and physical examination findings are not consistent with mucoepidermoid carcinoma.

Hemangioma is a benign vascular tumor. It is the most common soft tissue tumor in children. The patient's history and physical examination findings are not consistent with hemangioma.

Explanation:

Extramammary Paget disease (EMPD) is a rare, slow-growing skin cancer that starts in the cells that produce the outer layer of skin (epidermis). It is most commonly found in the genital area, but can also occur in the armpits, groin, and other areas of the body.

EMPD typically presents as a red, scaly, or eczema-like rash that does not respond to treatment with topical steroids. The rash may also be itchy, painful, or bleeding.

The diagnosis of EMPD is made by biopsy, which is the removal of a small piece of skin for examination under a microscope. Treatment for EMPD depends on the stage of the disease. In early-stage disease, treatment may consist of surgery to remove the affected skin followed by radiation therapy. In more advanced disease, chemotherapy may also be used.

The prognosis for patients with EMPD is generally good. With early diagnosis and treatment, most patients can be cured. However, the disease can be locally recurrent and can spread to other parts of the body.

The other options are incorrect because:

* A. Fungal infection is a common cause of skin rash, but it is usually not associated with a scaly, pink-red beefy plaque.
* C. Bowen disease is a type of skin cancer that starts in the squamous cells of the epidermis. It typically presents as a red, scaly patch of skin that does not heal.

Explanation:
The patient is a man in his 50s who previously underwent renal transplantation for polycystic kidney disease. He presented with worsening chronic malaise, fatigue, dyspnea, early satiety, and abdominal distention with extreme discomfort. An abdominal magnetic resonance image showed a giant multinodular mass. Given the symptoms and magnetic resonance imaging findings, the patient was eventually taken to the operating room. Laparotomy exposed a giant multinodular mass.

The most likely diagnosis is a de novo kidney graft tumor. This is because the patient has a history of renal transplantation, and the symptoms and magnetic resonance imaging findings are consistent with a kidney tumor. Recurrence of polycystic kidney disease is less likely, as the patient has already undergone renal transplantation and the symptoms and magnetic resonance imaging findings are not typical of polycystic kidney disease.

Explanation:

The patient's hyponatremia is euvolemic because her blood pressure is 125/87 mm Hg, her mucosae are moist, her jugular venous pressure is not well seen, her cardiopulmonary and abdominal examinations are normal, and her peripheral edema is absent. Her serum sodium concentration is 125 mEq/L, which is below the normal range of 135-145 mEq/L. Her serum osmolality is 280 mOsm/kg, which is within the normal range of 275-295 mOsm/kg. Her urine osmolality is 100 mOsm/kg, which is below the normal range of 50-1000 mOsm/kg. This suggests that the patient has a dilutional hyponatremia, which is caused by an excess of free water relative to solutes. The most likely cause of the patient's dilutional hyponatremia is her recent addition of haloperidol, which is a medication that can cause the kidneys to excrete more sodium and less water. The patient's hyponatremia is not hypovolemic because her blood pressure is normal and she does not have peripheral edema.

The patient has a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and stage 3 renal insufficiency. These are risk factors for aortic valve stenosis. The physical examination reveals a late-peaking systolic murmur that radiates to the carotids, which is a classic finding in aortic valve stenosis. The TTE shows a thickened aortic valve with a reduced aortic valve area. These findings are consistent with severe aortic valve stenosis.

The other options are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms and findings.

A. Functional mitral regurgitation is a condition in which the mitral valve does not close properly, allowing blood to flow back into the left atrium during systole. It is usually caused by left ventricular dysfunction, such as in a dilated cardiomyopathy. The patient's TTE shows a normal left ventricular systolic function, so this is not the correct diagnosis.

B. Obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a condition in which the left ventricle is thickened and stiff. This can cause obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract, which can lead to a systolic murmur. However, the patient's TTE shows a normal left ventricular outflow tract, so this is not the correct diagnosis.

D. Severe aortic valve stenosis with preserved left ventricular systolic function is a condition in which the aortic valve is severely narrowed, but the left ventricle is still able to pump blood effectively. This is a rare condition, and it is not the most likely diagnosis in this patient.

The patient has severe bilateral optic disc edema, peripapillary hemorrhages, and absent spontaneous venous pulsations. These findings are consistent with raised intracranial pressure. The most common cause of raised intracranial pressure in adults is a mass lesion, such as a tumor, abscess, or hematoma. Other possible causes include hydrocephalus, meningitis, and encephalitis.

An MRI or MRV of the brain and orbits is the most appropriate test to diagnose the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. These tests can provide detailed images of the brain and orbits, which can help to identify any mass lesions, hydrocephalus, or other abnormalities.

A skeletal survey is not necessary in this case, as the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a skeletal disorder. Serum and urine protein electrophoresis is not a sensitive or specific test for intracranial hypertension.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is to order an MRI or MRV of the brain and orbits.

The patient is a man in his 60s who presented with a slowly enlarging, painful mass on his buttock. He recalled that a small lesion had appeared approximately 8 months prior, and over the past several months he had noted significant growth and pain. A nonpruritic rash had also become apparent on his forearms and thighs. Physical examination showed a 2-cm macerated pedunculated growth on the left buttock within the intergluteal cleft. An erythematous rash was noted on the forearms and thighs with fine scale present at the wrists.

A shave biopsy specimen of the exophytic growth on the buttock revealed marked epidermal hyperplasia with a dense dermal infiltrate containing lymphocytes and plasma cells. Immunohistochemical staining for spirochetes was positive.

These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of granuloma inguinale, a chronic granulomatous sexually transmitted disease caused by Calymmatobacterium granulomatis. The disease is characterized by the development of painless, indurated nodules that may ulcerate. The nodules are typically found in the genital and inguinal regions, but they can also occur on the buttocks, thighs, and arms. Granuloma inguinale is most common in tropical and subtropical regions, but it can occur anywhere in the world.

The treatment of granuloma inguinale is with antibiotics, such as doxycycline or azithromycin. The infection is usually curable with appropriate treatment.

Explanation:
The patient is a 40-year-old man who resided in the eastern part of India, which is an endemic area for histoplasmosis. He presented with a nonhealing ulcer on the tongue that had been present for 4 months. The lesion was asymptomatic except for causing mild difficulty in eating. The patient could not recall any history of trauma or tongue bite preceding the lesion. He denied consuming tobacco or alcohol regularly. He had type 2 diabetes mellitus for 2 years, which was well controlled with oral hypoglycemic agents. The patient had no systemic complaints. There was no history of high-risk behavior for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acquisition. On physical examination, there was a single well-defined ulcer measuring 2 × 2 cm on the right lateral aspect of tongue with a clean base and irregular and elevated heaped-up margins. There was no underlying induration, friability, or bleeding on manipulation. The rest of the oral cavity was normal. A 3-mm punch biopsy from the edge of the ulcer was taken and sent for histopathological examination. The biopsy showed a mixed cell infiltrate with numerous intracellular yeast forms within the histiocytes. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of primary oral histoplasmosis.

Squamous cell carcinoma is a malignant neoplasm of the squamous epithelium of the tongue. It is the most common type of oral cancer, accounting for approximately 90% of cases. The risk factors for squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue include tobacco use, alcohol use, and human papillomavirus infection. The most common presentation of squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue is a nonhealing ulcer on the tongue. The diagnosis is made by biopsy. The treatment for squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue is surgery, radiation therapy, or a combination of both.

Mucocutaneous leishmaniasis is a chronic, granulomatous infection caused by Leishmania parasites. The parasites are transmitted to humans by the bite of infected sandflies. The most common clinical presentation of mucocutaneous leishmaniasis is a single or multiple ulcers on the skin or mucous membranes. The diagnosis is made by clinical presentation, history of exposure to sandflies, and laboratory testing. The treatment for mucocutaneous leishmaniasis is with antileishmanial drugs.

Tuberculous chancre is a primary infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis that occurs at the site of inoculation. It is most commonly seen in children and young adults. The chancre is a painless, indurated ulcer that develops 2-4 weeks after infection. The diagnosis is made by clinical presentation, history of exposure to tuberculosis, and laboratory testing. The treatment for tuberculous chancre is with antituberculosis drugs.

Explanation: The needle-cover technique is the preferred method for removing a fishhook from the eye. It is a safe and effective technique that minimizes the risk of further injury to the eye. The technique involves using a large bore needle to engage the barb of the fishhook and then withdrawing the hook and needle together. The needle covers the barb and prevents it from catching on the tissue, which can damage the eye. The other techniques are not as safe or effective as the needle-cover technique. The back-out technique can be difficult and can damage the eye if the hook is not removed properly. The advance-and-cut technique can also damage the eye, and there is a risk of the hook breaking off inside the eye. The cut-and-push-through technique is the least safe technique, and it is not recommended. It can cause significant damage to the eye, and there is a risk of the hook breaking off inside the eye.

The patient's presentation is concerning for a posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), which is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition that can occur after bariatric surgery. PRES is characterized by hypertension, seizures, headache, and visual disturbances. The diagnosis is made with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which typically shows vasogenic edema in the posterior fossa. Treatment of PRES includes aggressive blood pressure control and, in some cases, plasmapheresis or hemodialysis.

The other options are incorrect because:

* A. Lumbar puncture is not necessary for the diagnosis of PRES.
* C. Intravenous vitamin therapy is not a treatment for PRES.
* D. Intravenous corticosteroids may be used to treat PRES, but they are not the first-line treatment.

In this case, the patient was diagnosed with PRES and treated with aggressive blood pressure control. She made a full recovery.

Explanation:
Aspiration is the entry of foreign material into the lungs. In this case, the patient is a neonate who developed difficulty breathing and apnea requiring cardiopulmonary resuscitation after 2 days of cough and congestion. He was diagnosed with bronchiolitis, but he continued to have choking with feeds and a large volume of clear oral secretions that required frequent suctioning. These clinical findings are consistent with aspiration.

Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is the backward flow of stomach contents into the esophagus. It is a common problem in infants, and it is usually not serious. However, GER can sometimes cause complications, such as aspiration.

Tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) is a congenital anomaly in which there is an abnormal connection between the trachea and the esophagus. TEF is a serious condition that requires surgery to correct.

Esophageal perforation is a tear in the esophagus. It can be caused by a number of things, including foreign objects, blunt trauma, and caustic ingestion. Esophageal perforation is a medical emergency that requires surgery to repair.

In this case, the patient's clinical findings are most consistent with aspiration. The other possible diagnoses (GER, TEF, and esophageal perforation) are less likely.

Explanation:

Carcinoma of the gallbladder is a rare malignancy that accounts for less than 2% of all cancers. It is more common in women than men, and the average age at diagnosis is 65 years. The most common symptom is abdominal pain, which is often accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and jaundice. The diagnosis is made by imaging studies, such as ultrasonography or computed tomography (CT), and biopsy. Treatment is surgical removal of the gallbladder.

Acute cholecystitis is an inflammation of the gallbladder that is caused by obstruction of the cystic duct. The most common symptom is abdominal pain, which is often accompanied by fever, nausea, and vomiting. The diagnosis is made by clinical history and imaging studies, such as ultrasonography or CT. Treatment is usually with antibiotics and pain medication. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the gallbladder.

Xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis is a rare, chronic inflammatory condition of the gallbladder that is characterized by the accumulation of foamy macrophages and cholesterol crystals in the gallbladder wall. It is more common in women than men, and the average age at diagnosis is 60 years. The most common symptom is abdominal pain, which is often accompanied by fever, nausea, and vomiting. The diagnosis is made by imaging studies, such as ultrasonography or CT, and biopsy. Treatment is usually with antibiotics and pain medication. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the gallbladder.

Lymphoma is a type of cancer that starts in the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is part of the immune system and helps fight infection. Lymphoma can affect any part of the body, but it is most common in the lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow. The most common symptom of lymphoma is lymphadenopathy, or swollen lymph nodes. Other symptoms may include fever, fatigue, weight loss, and night sweats. The diagnosis is made by a biopsy of a lymph node. Treatment depends on the type and stage of the lymphoma, but may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or stem cell transplantation.

In the case presented, the patient is a woman in her 60s who presents with abdominal pain and weight loss. She has a history of cardiac arrhythmia, hypertension, and sigmoidectomy for diverticulitis. Her medications include lasilix, amlodipine, amiodarone, and atenolol. On examination, the patient appears well. Her vital signs are normal. The abdomen is soft without distension. A positive Murphy sign is observed. Her white blood cell count is 11400/μL, her hemoglobin level is 11.5 g/dL, and her platelet count is 233 ×103/μL. The C-reaction protein level is elevated to 41 mg/L. The results of renal and liver function, coagulation, blood level of electrolytes, total protein, albumin, antigen carcino embryonnaire, carbohydrate antigen 19-9, carbohydrate antigen 125, and β2 microglobulin tests are normal. The patient has a normal esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy. Ultrasonography reveals a 10 × 8-m mass in the right hypochondrium. Abdominal computed tomography scan reveals a thickened gallbladder wall infiltrating the liver parenchyma. There were 3 perihepatic lymph nodes. Magnetic resonance imaging showed a greatly enlarged gallbladder with a thickened wall without invading adjacent structures, a continuous mucosal line, and a hypoattenuated intramural nodule.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis. This is supported by the patient's history of abdominal pain and weight loss, the physical examination findings of a positive Murphy sign, the laboratory findings of an elevated C-reactive protein level, the imaging findings of a thickened gallbladder wall infiltrating the liver parenchyma, and the lack of findings on esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy. Carcinoma of the gallbladder is less likely in this case because the patient is a woman and the tumor is not invading adjacent structures. Acute cholecystitis is also less likely because the patient does not have fever or nausea and vomiting. Lymphoma is a possibility, but it is less likely than xanthogranulomatous cholecystitis given the patient's history and physical examination findings.

 89%|████████▉ | 1363/1525 [5:12:02<35:14, 13.05s/it]The answer is **B: Small-bowel volvulus**.

A small-bowel volvulus is a twisting of the small intestine on itself, which can cause a blockage of the intestine. It is the most common cause of intestinal obstruction in newborns. The symptoms of a small-bowel volvulus include abdominal distention, vomiting, and bloody stools.

In this case, the infant developed abdominal distention and vomiting after feeding. She also had a soft but distended abdomen and right-sided labial swelling. The abdominal radiograph revealed dilated small-bowel loops, and the radiography of the upper gastrointestinal tract with water-soluble contrast showed a normal pattern of rotation. Results of a suction rectal biopsy revealed ganglion cells to be present. Serial abdominal radiographic images showed retained contrast in the terminal ileum 6 days following the gastrointestinal series.

All of these findings are consistent with a diagnosis of small-bowel volvulus. The retained contrast in the terminal ileum is a particularly important finding, as it is a classic sign of small-bowel volvulus.

Cecal duplication is a rare congenital anomaly in which there is an abnormal duplication of the cecum. It is usually asymptomatic, but can sometimes cause abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea.

Infantile leiomyosarcoma is a rare malignant tumor of the smooth muscle of the intestine. It is usually diagnosed in children under the age of 1 year. The symptoms of infantile leiomyosarcoma include abdominal distention, vomiting, and bloody stools.

Ovarian cyst with torsion is a condition in which an ovarian cyst twists on its stalk, which can cut off the blood supply to the ovary. It is usually diagnosed in adolescent girls and young women. The symptoms of ovarian cyst with torsion include abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis in this case is small-bowel volvulus. The other possible diagnoses are less likely based on the patient's history and physical examination findings.

 89%|████████▉ | 1364/1525 [5:12:12<32:52, 12.25s/it]Answer: C. The patient has lactic acidosis from mesenteric ischemia.

Explanation:

The patient has a large, firm, tender mass located near the umbilicus that is abutting multiple segments of the small intestine and encasing the mesenteric vasculature. This suggests that the patient has mesenteric ischemia, which is a condition that occurs when the blood supply to the small intestine is decreased. Mesenteric ischemia can lead to tissue death and necrosis, which can be fatal if not treated promptly.

Lactic acidosis is a condition that occurs when the body produces too much lactic acid. Lactic acid is a waste product that is produced when the body breaks down glucose for energy. When the blood supply to the tissues is decreased, the cells are not able to get enough oxygen, which causes them to break down glucose for energy at a faster rate. This can lead to the production of too much lactic acid, which can cause the blood pH to drop.

The patient's elevated lactate level is consistent with the diagnosis of lactic acidosis. The patient's history of nausea and vomiting, abdominal pain, and a large mass in the abdomen are also consistent with the diagnosis of mesenteric ischemia.

The patient's tachycardia and hypotension are consistent with hypovolemic shock. However, the patient's lactate level is not consistent with the diagnosis of hypovolemic shock. In hypovolemic shock, the lactate level is typically less than 2 mmol/L.

The patient's lymphoma is not likely to be the cause of his lactic acidosis. Lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymph nodes. It is not typically associated with lactic acidosis.

The patient's sepsis is not likely to be the cause of his lactic acidosis. Sepsis is a serious infection that can cause the blood pressure to drop and the lactate level to rise. However, the patient's blood pressure is not low and his lactate level is not high enough to be consistent with the diagnosis of sepsis.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is that the patient has lactic acidosis from mesenteric ischemia.

 90%|████████▉ | 1365/1525 [5:12:25<33:05, 12.41s/it]The correct answer is: **D. Observe and provide supplemental oxygen.**

The patient's symptoms are consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which is a life-threatening condition that can develop after a choking incident. ARDS is characterized by inflammation and fluid accumulation in the lungs, which can lead to respiratory failure.

The initial management of ARDS focuses on supportive care, including supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, and fluid management. Antibiotics are not indicated in the absence of infection. Inhaled β2-agonists and steroids may be used to improve lung function, but their efficacy is not well-established.

The patient in this case is hemodynamically stable and does not have any signs of infection. Therefore, the best management is to observe her closely and provide supplemental oxygen. If her condition worsens, she may need to be intubated and mechanically ventilated.

Here is a more detailed explanation of each of the possible answers:

* **A. Start intravenous antibiotics, intravenous fluid resuscitation, and obtain serum lactate level and blood and sputum cultures.** This is not the correct answer because the patient does not have any signs of infection. Antibiotics should not be started without a clear indication of infection.
* **B. Start oxygen, β2-agonist nebulizer treatments, steroids, and oral azithromycin.** This is not the correct answer because the patient does not have any signs of asthma or COPD. Inhaled β2-agonists and steroids may be used to improve lung function in patients with these conditions, but their efficacy is not well-established in patients with ARDS.
* **C. Start aspirin, β-blocker, and consider cardiac catheterization.** This is not the correct answer because the patient does not have any signs of coronary artery disease. Aspirin and β-blockers are used to reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke in patients with coronary artery disease, but they are not indicated in patients with ARDS.
* **D. Observe and provide supplemental oxygen.** This is the correct answer because the patient is hemodynamically stable and does not have any signs of infection. The initial management of ARDS focuses on supportive care, including supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, and fluid management.

The patient's skin and mouth lesions are suspicious for Kaposi sarcoma, a type of cancer that is often associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Computed tomography imaging of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis is a useful test for diagnosing Kaposi sarcoma. It can also help to identify other potential causes of the patient's symptoms, such as metastatic cancer or infection.

Initiating empirical treatment with a topical steroid or photodynamic therapy would be premature without a definitive diagnosis. Ordering an HIV test is also important, but it should not be the only test that is ordered. Computed tomography imaging is a more sensitive test for Kaposi sarcoma and can provide more information about the extent of the patient's disease.

Explanation:

Gilbert syndrome is the most common inherited disorder of bilirubin metabolism. It is characterized by mild, asymptomatic hyperbilirubinemia due to impaired uptake of bilirubin by hepatocytes. The condition is caused by a mutation in the gene that encodes the protein responsible for transporting bilirubin into hepatocytes. Gilbert syndrome is typically diagnosed in adolescence or early adulthood, and it is more common in men than women. The condition is usually not associated with any other health problems, and it does not require treatment. However, people with Gilbert syndrome may be more likely to develop jaundice if they are exposed to certain medications or conditions that can increase bilirubin levels, such as dehydration, infection, or alcohol consumption.

In the case presented, the patient is a 57-year-old white man with a history of asymptomatic hyperbilirubinemia. He has no jaundice, pruritus, or family history of liver disease. He takes no medications and drinks 1 alcoholic beverage daily. On physical examination, he has no stigmata of chronic liver disease. His laboratory values show an elevated direct bilirubin level, consistent with Gilbert syndrome.

The other options are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation. Cholelithiasis is a condition characterized by the formation of gallstones in the gallbladder. Gallstones can cause abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Dubin-Johnson syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by chronic, conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Patients with Dubin-Johnson syndrome may have dark urine and grayish-brown discoloration of the liver. Hemolysis is the breakdown of red blood cells, which can lead to elevated indirect bilirubin levels. Patients with hemolysis may have jaundice, anemia, and dark urine.

Syringomatous adenoma of the nipple is a rare, benign (noncancerous) tumor of the nipple and areola. It is characterized by the growth of small, glandular ducts that form acini (small sacs). The tumor is usually solitary and painless, and it is most often diagnosed in women in their 50s or 60s.

Syringomatous adenoma of the nipple can be diagnosed on a biopsy, which is a procedure in which a small piece of tissue is removed from the tumor and examined under a microscope. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by the presence of characteristic features, such as the formation of acini and the presence of myoepithelial cells.

Syringomatous adenoma of the nipple is usually treated by surgical excision of the tumor. In some cases, radiation therapy may be recommended to reduce the risk of recurrence.

The other options are incorrect because they are all malignant (cancerous) tumors. Tubular carcinoma is a type of breast cancer that is characterized by the growth of small, tubular glands. Low-grade adenosquamous carcinoma is a type of breast cancer that is composed of both glandular and squamous cells. Florid papillomatosis of the nipple is a benign (noncancerous) condition that is characterized by the growth of multiple papillomas (small, wart-like tumors) on the nipple.

Explanation:

Kindler syndrome is a rare, autosomal recessive genodermatosis characterized by skin fragility, blistering, and photosensitivity. The skin lesions are typically linear and geographic in shape, and they are most commonly located on the trunk, extremities, and face. Symptoms usually appear in infancy or early childhood, and they may worsen with sun exposure. There is no cure for Kindler syndrome, but treatment can help to improve the symptoms and prevent complications.

The skin biopsy in the case report shows remarkable detachment of the entire stratum corneum, which is a characteristic finding of Kindler syndrome. The other possible diagnoses (Dermatitis artefacta, Epidermolysis bullosa simplex superficialis, and Peeling skin disease) do not explain the findings on the skin biopsy.

Dermatitis artefacta is a skin condition that is caused by the patient intentionally damaging their own skin. The lesions in Dermatitis artefacta are typically irregular in shape and size, and they may have a history of changing over time. The skin biopsy in the case report does not show any evidence of self-inflicted injury.

Epidermolysis bullosa simplex superficialis is a genetic disorder that causes blisters to form on the skin and mucous membranes. The blisters in Epidermolysis bullosa simplex superficialis are typically caused by minor trauma, such as friction or rubbing. The skin biopsy in the case report does not show any evidence of Epidermolysis bullosa simplex superficialis.

Peeling skin disease is a general term that describes any condition that causes the skin to peel. There are many different causes of peeling skin disease, including eczema, psoriasis, and contact dermatitis. The skin biopsy in the case report does not show any evidence of a specific cause of peeling skin disease.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for the patient in the case report is Kindler syndrome.

Explanation:
The patient is a healthy woman in her 40s, lactating, 5 months post partum, presented with a 1-month history of enlargement and induration of both breasts. She was initially diagnosed with mastitis and received several courses of antibiotics for 2 months without improvement. Subsequently she presented with back pain, paresthesias, shooting pain in the mandibular region, and diplopia. All of these conditions improved under treatment with oral corticosteroids, but the breast enlargement continued. Laboratory test results highlighted a hemoglobin level of 7.6 g/dL and a platelet count of 80 000/μL.

Acute lymphoblastic leukemia of the breast is a rare cancer that occurs in the blood and bone marrow. It is most common in children, but it can also occur in adults. The symptoms of acute lymphoblastic leukemia include fever, fatigue, weight loss, and bone pain. The diagnosis is made with a blood test and a bone marrow biopsy. The treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia includes chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

Breast implant foreign body reaction is a condition that occurs when the body rejects a breast implant. The symptoms of breast implant foreign body reaction include pain, swelling, and redness around the implant. The diagnosis is made with a physical exam and imaging tests. The treatment for breast implant foreign body reaction is to remove the implant.

Severe postpartum mastitis is a bacterial infection of the breast that occurs during or after breastfeeding. The symptoms of severe postpartum mastitis include fever, chills, redness, and swelling of the breast. The diagnosis is made with a physical exam and a culture of the breast milk. The treatment for severe postpartum mastitis is antibiotics.

Burkitt lymphoma is a type of lymphoma that is characterized by the rapid growth of abnormal B cells. It is most common in children and young adults, but it can also occur in adults. The symptoms of Burkitt lymphoma include fever, fatigue, weight loss, and swollen lymph nodes. The diagnosis is made with a biopsy of the lymph node. The treatment for Burkitt lymphoma includes chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

The patient in this case has a history of breast enlargement and induration that has not responded to treatment with antibiotics. She also has back pain, paresthesias, shooting pain in the mandibular region, and diplopia. All of these conditions improved under treatment with oral corticosteroids, but the breast enlargement continued. Laboratory test results highlighted a hemoglobin level of 7.6 g/dL and a platelet count of 80 000/μL. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of Burkitt lymphoma of the breast.

The patient has multiple hypopigmented skin macules on the trunk, scalp, neck, face, back, and limbs, as well as a well-demarcated hypopigmented lesion originating from the retinal nerve fiber layer and protruding into the vitreous cavity of the right eye. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of linear epidermal nevus syndrome, which is a rare genetic disorder characterized by the presence of linear epidermal nevi, leptomeningeal melanocytosis, and other associated anomalies.

The most common associated anomaly in linear epidermal nevus syndrome is central nervous system involvement, which can occur in up to 50% of cases. The most common manifestations of central nervous system involvement are seizures, mental retardation, and hydrocephalus. Other associated anomalies can include spinal cord abnormalities, retinal astrocytic hamartomas, and cardiac defects.

The patient in the case presentation has a history of seizures, which is a common manifestation of central nervous system involvement in linear epidermal nevus syndrome. The patient also has a retinal astrocytic hamartoma, which is a benign tumor that can occur in patients with linear epidermal nevus syndrome.

Given the patient's history and physical examination findings, the next step in management is to obtain brain imaging and echocardiography to evaluate for central nervous system and cardiac involvement. If these studies are negative, a fine-needle aspiration biopsy of the ocular lesion can be performed to confirm the diagnosis of retinal astrocytic hamartoma.

The other options are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate next steps in management for a patient with linear epidermal nevus syndrome. Renal ultrasonography and lumbar puncture are not necessary to evaluate for central nervous system involvement in patients with linear epidermal nevus syndrome. Metastatic workup is not necessary in patients with linear epidermal nevus syndrome, as the disease is not associated with metastatic disease.

The patient is a 57-year-old woman with non–insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and no other medical history. She has worsening left-sided back pain over 4 months and no other symptoms. Physical examination findings are significant for mild left flank pain, but there is no costovertebral angle tenderness. Laboratory results are within normal limits. Axial imaging demonstrated an exophytic, retroperitoneal mass with solid and cystic components involving the left kidney, posterior abdominal wall, and mesocolon (Figure 1). The mass measured 20 cm in its greatest dimension. Findings on colonoscopy and mammography were negative. Positron emission tomography–computed tomography did not reveal any other abnormality.

The differential diagnosis for a retroperitoneal mass includes:

* Lymphoma
* Malignant transformation of an enterogenous cyst
* Retroperitoneal sarcoma
* Primary neoplasm arising from the kidney

Lymphoma is a malignancy of the lymphatic system. It can present as a retroperitoneal mass, but it is more likely to involve the lymph nodes in the neck, axilla, or groin. The patient in this case does not have any lymphadenopathy, which makes lymphoma less likely.

Malignant transformation of an enterogenous cyst is a rare condition in which a benign cyst in the lining of the intestine becomes cancerous. It can present as a retroperitoneal mass, but it is more likely to occur in children. The patient in this case is an adult, which makes malignant transformation of an enterogenous cyst less likely.

Retroperitoneal sarcoma is a malignancy of the soft tissues of the abdomen. It is a rare tumor, but it is the most common type of retroperitoneal mass in adults. The patient in this case has a large, exophytic mass with solid and cystic components, which is typical of a retroperitoneal sarcoma.

Primary neoplasm arising from the kidney is a malignancy of the kidney. It is the most common type of renal cancer. The patient in this case does not have any symptoms of renal cancer, such as hematuria (blood in the urine) or flank pain. The mass in this case is also large and exophytic, which is more typical of a retroperitoneal sarcoma than a primary neoplasm arising from the kidney.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for the patient in this case is retroperitoneal sarcoma.

The patient has a history of psoriasis, which is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by thick, red, scaly patches of skin. Psoriasis is often associated with other autoimmune conditions, such as HIV infection. In patients with HIV, psoriasis can be more severe and difficult to treat.

The patient in this case has a new rash that is intensely pruritic (itchy) and has diffuse crust and scale. These findings are consistent with psoriasis, but they could also be caused by other conditions, such as secondary syphilis, a sexually transmitted infection. Syphilis can cause a rash that is similar to psoriasis, but it is important to distinguish between the two conditions because syphilis is treatable with antibiotics, while psoriasis is not.

To determine the cause of the rash, the most appropriate next step is to perform a skin scraping with microscopy. This procedure involves scraping a small piece of skin from the affected area and examining it under a microscope. This can help to identify the type of cells that are present in the rash, which can help to determine the cause of the rash.

Prescribing a topical corticosteroid, ordering syphilis serology, or prescribing a topical antifungal are not the most appropriate next steps in this case. Topical corticosteroids can be used to treat psoriasis, but they are not the first-line treatment for secondary syphilis. Syphilis serology is a blood test that can be used to screen for syphilis, but it is not necessary in this case because the patient has a history of psoriasis. Topical antifungals are not effective against psoriasis.

Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to perform a skin scraping with microscopy.

 90%|█████████ | 1377/1525 [5:14:40<27:27, 11.13s/it]The correct answer is: D. The patient is hypoperfused and requires further fluid and pressor resuscitation.

The patient's lactate level is elevated, which is a sign of tissue hypoxia. This is likely due to hypoperfusion, as evidenced by the patient's hypotension, tachycardia, and oliguria. The patient also has a history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and cirrhosis, which are all risk factors for sepsis. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's immune system responds to an infection by overreacting and damaging its own tissues. It can cause multiple organ dysfunction and death.

The patient's lactate level decreased initially after fluid resuscitation, but then started to increase again. This suggests that the patient's hypoperfusion is not being adequately treated. The patient should be given further fluid and pressor resuscitation, and should be evaluated for the source of his infection.

A. The patient has epinephrine-induced β2-adrenergic stimulation driving his hyperlactatemia. This is unlikely, as the patient's lactate level decreased initially after fluid resuscitation. Epinephrine is a hormone that is released in response to stress. It causes the heart to beat faster and the blood vessels to constrict. This can lead to an increase in blood pressure and a decrease in blood flow to the tissues. However, the patient's blood pressure was already low, so it is unlikely that epinephrine would have caused his lactate level to increase.

B. The patient likely has sepsis, possibly with an uncontrolled infectious source, that requires further workup. This is possible, but the patient's lactate level decreased initially after fluid resuscitation. Sepsis is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the body's immune system responds to an infection by overreacting and damaging its own tissues. It can cause multiple organ dysfunction and death. The patient's history of coronary artery disease, hypertension, and cirrhosis are all risk factors for sepsis. However, the patient's lactate level decreased initially after fluid resuscitation, which suggests that the infection may be under control. The patient should be evaluated for the source of his infection, but it is not clear that sepsis is the cause of his hyperlactatemia.

C. The patient has decreased lactate clearance due to liver dysfunction and complicated by Ringer lactate solution. This is unlikely, as the patient's lactate level decreased initially after fluid resuscitation. Liver dysfunction can lead to decreased lactate clearance. However, the patient's lactate level decreased initially after fluid resuscitation, which suggests that the liver is not the primary cause of his hyperlactatemia. Ringer lactate solution is a type of intravenous fluid that is often used to treat dehydration. It contains lactate, which is a type of sugar. However, there is no evidence that Ringer lactate solution can cause decreased lactate clearance.

Explanation:
The patient's presentation is most consistent with a diagnosis of pityriasis rosea, a common skin condition characterized by a herald patch followed by a widespread eruption of papules. The herald patch is usually a solitary, large, oval or round lesion with a central clearing and a scaly border. The papules are smaller than the herald patch and are often arranged in a "Christmas tree" pattern. The rash is usually nonpruritic but can be associated with burning pain.

Pityriasis rosea is thought to be caused by a viral infection, most commonly human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6). There is no specific treatment for pityriasis rosea, but the rash usually resolves on its own within 6-8 weeks. In some cases, treatment with oral prednisone may be necessary to relieve symptoms.

To confirm the diagnosis of pityriasis rosea, a dermatologist may unroof one of the papules and send a sample for viral culture. This test can help to distinguish pityriasis rosea from other skin conditions with similar symptoms, such as psoriasis or eczema.

The other options are incorrect because they are not necessary or appropriate in the management of pityriasis rosea. A lipid panel is not necessary to diagnose pityriasis rosea, as the rash is not associated with any underlying medical conditions. A chest radiograph is also not necessary, as the rash is not associated with any respiratory problems. Empirical treatment with oral prednisone is not recommended for pityriasis rosea, as the rash usually resolves on its own within 6-8 weeks.

The audiogram shows a right-sided sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), with a loss of hearing in the high frequencies. This is consistent with the patient's history of slowly progressive hearing loss. The impaired speech discrimination is also consistent with a SNHL.

Meniere disease is a disorder of the inner ear that can cause hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo, and aural fullness. However, the audiogram in this case does not show the characteristic findings of Meniere disease, such as a low-frequency hearing loss and fluctuating hearing loss.

Age-related hearing loss (presbycusis) is the most common type of hearing loss. It is caused by damage to the hair cells in the inner ear, which are responsible for hearing. Presbycusis typically affects both ears and causes a gradual loss of hearing in the high frequencies. The audiogram in this case does not show the characteristic findings of presbycusis.

Otosclerosis is a disorder that causes the stapes, one of the bones in the middle ear, to become fixed in place. This can cause hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo. The audiogram in this case does not show the characteristic findings of otosclerosis, such as a conductive hearing loss with a notch at 2000 Hz.

Therefore, the most likely explanation for the patient's hearing loss is a right-sided SNHL. Further investigation, such as an MRI of the brain and inner ear, is necessary to determine the cause of the hearing loss.

Erythema nodosum is a skin condition characterized by tender, red nodules on the lower legs. It is often associated with underlying inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and sarcoidosis.

In the case presented, the patient's history of abdominal pain, bloating, vomiting, diarrhea, subjective fever, weight loss, and fatigue is suggestive of an underlying inflammatory condition. The physical examination findings of multiple ill-defined, exquisitely tender erythematous subcutaneous nodules on his bilateral shins, medial feet, ankles, and right lower thigh without overlying ulceration, necrosis, or drainage are also consistent with erythema nodosum. The punch biopsy results, which demonstrated pathognomonic histopathologic findings, further support the diagnosis of erythema nodosum.

Explanation:

The patient's history of severe peripheral arterial disease and a remote history of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm are risk factors for cutaneous cholesterol embolism. The physical examination findings of a well-defined 5 × 12-cm purpuric patch with a darker stellate patch within it are consistent with cutaneous cholesterol embolism. The biopsy specimens show needle-shaped clefts within the lumen of a blood vessel with minimal perivascular inflammation, which is also consistent with cutaneous cholesterol embolism. Intravascular B-cell lymphoma is a rare type of cancer that affects the blood vessels. It is not a risk factor for cutaneous cholesterol embolism, and the physical examination findings and biopsy specimens are not consistent with intravascular B-cell lymphoma. Warfarin necrosis is a rare skin reaction that can occur in patients who are taking the anticoagulant drug warfarin. It is not a risk factor for cutaneous cholesterol embolism, and the physical examination findings and biopsy specimens are not consistent with warfarin necrosis.

Explanation:

Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita (EBA) is a rare autoimmune blistering disease characterized by the formation of blisters at the junction of the dermis and epidermis. It is most commonly seen in middle-aged and elderly adults, and there is no gender predilection. The most common presentation is with tense blisters on the hands and feet, but other areas of the body can also be affected. The blisters are often painful and can lead to scarring. The diagnosis of EBA is made on clinical grounds, supported by a skin biopsy. There is no cure for EBA, but treatment can help to control the symptoms and prevent scarring.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Bullous tinea pedis is a fungal infection of the feet that can cause blisters. However, the blisters in bullous tinea pedis are typically located on the soles of the feet, and they are not associated with scarring.
* Allergic contact dermatitis is a type of skin reaction that occurs when the skin comes into contact with an allergen. It can cause blisters, but the blisters are typically located on the areas of the skin that came into contact with the allergen. They are also not associated with scarring.
* Dyshidrosiform pemphigoid is a chronic blistering skin disease that typically affects the hands and feet. It can cause blisters, but the blisters are typically smaller and more numerous than those seen in EBA. They are also not associated with scarring.

The patient has a right-sided intranasal mass. This is the most likely cause of his symptoms, including pain, redness, and engorgement of the sclera. The mass could be a tumor, an infection, or a foreign body. A biopsy is necessary to determine the cause of the mass and to recommend appropriate treatment.

Increasing topical corticosteroid frequency, injecting sub–Tenon capsule triamcinolone acetonide, and giving oral prednisone are all treatments for inflammation. However, these treatments would not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, which is the mass in his nose. Therefore, they are not the best course of action.

Referring the patient to an otolaryngologist for nasal mass biopsy is the best course of action because it will allow the otolaryngologist to determine the cause of the mass and to recommend appropriate treatment.

 91%|█████████ | 1384/1525 [5:16:08<28:24, 12.09s/it]The correct answer is: **B: Serum antibody titer.**

Explanation:

The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with acute retinal necrosis (ARN), a demyelinating disease of the optic nerve. ARN is a rare, but serious, infection that can cause permanent blindness if not treated promptly. The most common cause of ARN is varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the same virus that causes chickenpox. Other possible causes include herpes simplex virus (HSV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).

The diagnosis of ARN is based on a history of recent VZV infection, characteristic clinical findings, and laboratory testing. The most sensitive test for ARN is a serum antibody titer to VZV. Antibodies to VZV can be detected in the blood within 2 weeks of infection. A high titer of antibodies to VZV is suggestive of ARN, but a negative titer does not rule out the diagnosis.

The treatment of ARN is with antiviral medications, such as acyclovir or valacyclovir. These medications can help to reduce the risk of permanent blindness. In addition, patients with ARN may need to be hospitalized for supportive care, such as intravenous fluids and eye drops.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate next steps in the management of a patient with ARN. Repeated neuroimaging is not necessary in the absence of new or worsening symptoms. Serum antibody titers to HSV and EBV are not helpful in the diagnosis of ARN, as these viruses are not the most common causes of the disease. Blood culture analysis is not indicated in the absence of fever or other signs of infection.

Explanation:

Tinea capitis is a fungal infection of the scalp that is most common in children. It is characterized by annular plaques with fine scaling and pustules. The diagnosis is made by potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation of a skin scraping, which reveals fungal hyphae. Treatment is with oral antifungal medications.

Granuloma annulare is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that can occur at any age. It is characterized by round or oval raised lesions with a central depression. The lesions are usually found on the hands, feet, and arms, but they can also occur on the scalp. The cause of granuloma annulare is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder. Treatment is usually not necessary, but the lesions may be treated with topical steroids or oral medications.

Neonatal lupus erythematosus is a rare autoimmune disease that can occur in infants born to mothers with systemic lupus erythematosus. The symptoms of neonatal lupus erythematosus can vary, but they often include skin lesions, heart problems, and seizures. The diagnosis is made by a blood test that detects antibodies to Ro and La antigens. Treatment is with corticosteroids and other medications.

Annular urticaria is a type of urticaria (hives) that occurs in rings or arcs. It is often caused by an allergic reaction, but it can also be caused by other factors, such as stress or infection. The lesions of annular urticaria are usually itchy and resolve on their own within a few days. Treatment is with antihistamines and other medications.

In this case, the patient is a 24-day-old male neonate with a 7-day history of annular plaques on the upper forehead and scalp. The plaques emerged on day 17 of life and did not change in appearance or increase in number. He had normal growth and development and no illnesses or fevers prior to presentation. He had no contact with sick persons or with household members with similar skin lesions, and there was no history of recent sun exposure. There was no family history of autoimmune disease, and the mother denied symptoms of dry eyes, dry mouth, cavities, or photosensitivity. A physical examination revealed a well-appearing afebrile male neonate with 5 annular plaques located on the frontal and posterior scalp. The thin red border had fine scaling and several pinpoint pustules. In addition, there were faintly pink patches with scaling on the medial eyebrows and mesolabial folds. There was no cervical or postauricular lymphadenopathy.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is tinea capitis. This is supported by the patient's age, the location of the lesions (scalp), the presence of fine scaling and pustules, and the absence of other systemic symptoms. The diagnosis can be confirmed by a KOH preparation of a skin scraping. Treatment is with oral antifungal medications.

Explanation: The patient has a history of hypertension and hyperlipidemia, which are risk factors for atherosclerosis. She has also had multiple transient ischemic attacks (TIAs), which are caused by temporary blockage of blood flow to the brain. The TIAs are likely due to a ruptured arterial plaque in the left internal carotid artery (ICA). The CT angiography shows a 95% stenosis of the left ICA, which is consistent with a ruptured plaque. A trapped air embolus (A) is unlikely, as there is no history of recent surgery or trauma. A free-floating arterial thrombus (B) is also unlikely, as there is no evidence of systemic anticoagulation. Radiographic artifact (D) is also unlikely, as the findings are consistent with a ruptured plaque.

The patient has a history of total thyroidectomy 15 years earlier for papillary thyroid cancer and is taking levothyroxine suppression therapy without evidence of recurrence. This history is consistent with the diagnosis of hypercalcemia from thyroid suppression therapy.

Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia is a rare genetic disorder characterized by elevated serum calcium levels and low urinary calcium excretion. It is not associated with a history of thyroid cancer or thyroidectomy.

Hypercalcemia of malignancy is a common paraneoplastic syndrome characterized by elevated serum calcium levels. It is caused by the secretion of parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP) by a tumor. The patient in this case does not have any evidence of malignancy.

 91%|█████████ | 1388/1525 [5:17:02<30:08, 13.20s/it]The correct answer is: A. Perform skin biopsy for histopathology and culture.

The patient has a pustulonodular lesion on the nose with a history of injection drug use, opioid drug snorting, and tobacco abuse. These risk factors suggest that the lesion may be due to an infection, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). MRSA is a type of bacteria that is resistant to many antibiotics. In order to determine the best treatment for the patient, it is necessary to perform a skin biopsy to obtain a sample of the lesion for histopathology and culture. Histopathology will allow the pathologist to examine the tissue under a microscope to look for signs of infection. Culture will allow the laboratory to grow the bacteria in order to identify the specific type of bacteria and to test its susceptibility to antibiotics. Once the specific type of bacteria has been identified, the patient can be treated with the most appropriate antibiotic.

Treatment with intravenous broad spectrum antibiotics (B) is not the best option because it is not specific to the type of bacteria that is causing the infection. Broad spectrum antibiotics are effective against a wide range of bacteria, but they can also kill beneficial bacteria in the body, which can lead to side effects such as diarrhea. Topical metronidazole (C) is not the best option because it is not effective against MRSA. Topical steroids (D) are not the best option because they can suppress the immune system, which can make the infection worse.

In conclusion, the correct answer is: A. Perform skin biopsy for histopathology and culture.

The lesions typically appear within hours to days of taking diclofenac and resolve within 2-4 weeks of discontinuing the medication. There is no specific treatment for diclofenac-induced bullous dermatosis, but supportive care may be helpful, such as oral antihistamines for itching and topical steroids for blisters. In severe cases, oral corticosteroids may be necessary.

The other options are incorrect because:

* Option A is incorrect because the blisters will not resolve over time if the patient continues to take diclofenac.

Explanation:

The patient in the case presented with a 3-month eruption of small reddish brown spots affecting most of his fingers. The lesions were persistent, asymptomatic, and without aggravating or alleviating factors. The patient used standard finger sticks to test his blood glucose levels daily. However, he had pricked his fingers for decades without incident. A review of symptoms was positive only for intermittent bloating and diarrhea. Physical examination revealed multiple petechiae in a linear arrangement extending from the volar and lateral aspects of the fingers to the finger pads. Results from initial laboratory tests, including a complete blood cell count, comprehensive metabolic panel, antinuclear antibody, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, rheumatoid factor, and cardiolipin antibody, were unremarkable. Results from a urinalysis and transthoracic echocardiogram were also unremarkable. Punch biopsies for histopathologic examination and direct immunofluorescence were performed.

The histopathologic image showed subtle collections of neutrophils within the dermal papillae. Direct Immunofluorescence revealed granular IgA deposition within the dermal papillae and at the dermoepidermal junction.

These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis. Dermatitis herpetiformis is a chronic, autoimmune blistering skin disease characterized by the eruption of small, grouped vesicles on the elbows, knees, buttocks, and scalp. It is associated with gluten sensitivity and is often seen in patients with celiac disease.

The diagnosis of dermatitis herpetiformis is made based on the clinical presentation, histopathologic findings, and direct immunofluorescence findings. Treatment is with dapsone, a medication that suppresses the immune system.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Janeway lesions are small, painless, hemorrhagic lesions that occur on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. They are associated with infective endocarditis.
* Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura is a disorder characterized by a low platelet count. This can lead to petechiae, ecchymosis, and bleeding.

Explanation:
The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with amyloidosis. The most common type of amyloidosis is primary amyloidosis, which is a systemic disease characterized by the deposition of amyloid fibrils in various organs and tissues. Amyloid fibrils are composed of misfolded proteins that aggregate and form insoluble deposits. The deposits can cause a variety of clinical manifestations, depending on the organs and tissues involved. In the skin, amyloidosis can cause trachyonychia (rough accentuated linear ridges), cutis laxa (loose, redundant skin), and easy bruising. The histopathologic findings of amyloidosis are characteristic, and include the presence of apple-green birefringence under polarized light microscopy. Lichen planus of the nails is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder that can cause nail dystrophy. However, it does not typically cause cutis laxa or easy bruising. Cutaneous sarcoidosis is a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect the skin, lymph nodes, and other organs. It can cause nail dystrophy, but it does not typically cause cutis laxa or easy bruising. Alopecia areata is an autoimmune disorder that causes hair loss. It does not typically cause nail dystrophy, cutis laxa, or easy bruising.

Explanation:
The patient in the case presented with a 92% total body surface area (TBSA), full-thickness burn after being doused in gasoline and set on fire. He underwent emergent chest, bilateral upper and lower extremity escharotomies, and a decompressive laparotomy for abdominal compartment syndrome. Thirteen days after admission, he required a left upper extremity amputation at the level of the proximal humerus owing to development of nonviable muscle tissue that demonstrated black plaques and white nodules. Once the patient was hemodynamically stable he was taken to the operating room and underwent 4 operations for debridement and grafting, with the initial operation taking place 10 days after admission. His hospital course was complicated by recurrent polymicrobial aspiration pneumonia, caused by methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterococcus. All were successfully treated with antibiotics.

The histopathologic images (C and D) show fungal hyphae invading the muscle tissue. The black plaques and white nodules seen clinically are consistent with cutaneous fungal infection. The most likely cause of this infection is Fusarium, a filamentous fungus that is commonly found in soil and water. Fusarium is a highly invasive fungus that can cause serious infections in patients with compromised immune systems, such as burn patients. The treatment for Fusarium infection is antifungal therapy with amphotericin B or voriconazole.

The other options are incorrect because they do not explain the clinical and histopathologic findings in this case. Staphylococcus and Pseudomonas are bacteria that are commonly found in the environment and can cause skin infections. However, they are not typically associated with invasive fungal infections. Candida and Aspergillus are fungi that can cause skin infections, but they are not typically associated with the black plaques and white nodules seen in this case.

Explanation:
The patient is an otherwise healthy 8-year-old girl with a relatively rapidly growing reddish mass on the caruncle of the left eye. On external examination, a pink, fleshy, pedunculated lesion with telangiectatic vessels on the surface was seen over the left caruncle. Her best-corrected visual acuity was 20/20 OU. Her ocular motility was intact in both eyes. The results of the examination of the anterior and posterior segments were within normal limits.

Based on the information provided, the patient's condition is most likely a conjunctival papilloma. Conjunctival papillomas are benign tumors that arise from the conjunctival epithelium. They are most commonly seen in children and young adults. The most common symptom of a conjunctival papilloma is a painless, fleshy mass on the conjunctiva. Conjunctival papillomas are usually self-limiting and resolve within a few months. However, in some cases, they may need to be treated with cryotherapy or excision.

In the case of the patient described above, the lesion is small and asymptomatic. There is no evidence of systemic involvement or malignancy. Therefore, the best course of action is to reassure the patient and observe the lesion for any changes. If the lesion grows or becomes symptomatic, it can then be treated with cryotherapy or excision.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Orbital imaging (magnetic resonance imaging) is not necessary in the absence of any evidence of orbital involvement. Treatment with prednisolone acetate, 1%, ophthalmic solution 4 times per day is not indicated for a benign conjunctival tumor. Cryotherapy (double–freeze-thaw method) is a treatment option for conjunctival papillomas, but it is not necessary in the case of a small, asymptomatic lesion.

 91%|█████████▏| 1394/1525 [5:18:11<28:24, 13.01s/it]The correct answer is: **A: Excisional biopsy of lesion**

Excisional biopsy is the gold standard for the diagnosis of ocular lesions. It allows for complete removal of the lesion, which can then be examined under a microscope to determine its type and grade. This information is essential for planning the best course of treatment.

Incisional biopsy is a less invasive procedure that involves removing a small piece of the lesion. This can be helpful in cases where the lesion is difficult to access or where there is a risk of damaging the eye. However, incisional biopsy does not provide as much information as excisional biopsy, and it may be necessary to perform a second procedure to remove the entire lesion.

Episcleral radioactive plaque treatment is a treatment option for some types of ocular tumors. It involves placing a radioactive plaque on the sclera, the white of the eye. The radiation from the plaque kills the tumor cells. This treatment is not appropriate for all types of ocular tumors, and it is important to discuss it with your doctor to see if it is right for you.

Observing the lesion is not a good option in this case. The lesion is growing and has associated retinal pigment epithelial pigment changes. These changes are suggestive of a malignant tumor. It is important to remove the lesion to determine its type and grade so that the best course of treatment can be planned.

Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) is a potentially fatal tick-borne illness caused by Rickettsia rickettsii, a bacterium. It is characterized by fever, headache, rash, and muscle aches. The rash typically begins on the wrists and ankles and spreads to the trunk and extremities. It may be petechial (pinpoint red spots), macular (flat red spots), or papular (raised red spots).

RMSF is most common in the southeastern and south-central United States, but it can occur in any state. The tick that transmits RMSF is the American dog tick (Dermacentor variabilis). The tick must be attached for at least 6 hours to transmit the infection.

The diagnosis of RMSF is based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. The most common laboratory finding in RMSF is thrombocytopenia (low platelet count). Other laboratory findings may include leukopenia (low white blood cell count), anemia, and elevated liver enzymes.

The treatment for RMSF is antibiotics. Doxycycline is the drug of choice. Patients with severe RMSF may also need to be hospitalized and receive intravenous fluids and antibiotics.

The prognosis for RMSF is good with early diagnosis and treatment. However, untreated RMSF can be fatal.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms. Disseminated gonococcal infection is a sexually transmitted infection that can cause fever, rash, and arthralgia. However, the patient in this case does not have any history of sexually transmitted infections. Streptobacillus moniliformis infection is a rare bacterial infection that can cause fever, rash, and arthralgia. However, the patient in this case does not have any exposure to rodents or other animals that could have transmitted the infection. Disseminated Staphylococcus aureus is a serious bacterial infection that can cause fever, rash, and arthralgia. However, the patient in this case does not have any risk factors for Staphylococcus aureus infection, such as recent surgery or hospitalization.

 92%|█████████▏| 1396/1525 [5:18:38<28:16, 13.15s/it]The answer is: **A: Gastrointestinal tuberculosis**

Explanation:

Gastrointestinal tuberculosis (GITB) is a rare cause of cachexia and chronic diarrhea. It is caused by infection with the Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacterium, which can spread to the gastrointestinal tract through the bloodstream or lymphatic system. GITB can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, but it is most common in the stomach and small intestine.

The most common symptoms of GITB are diarrhea, abdominal pain, and weight loss. Other symptoms may include fever, night sweats, and fatigue. GITB can be difficult to diagnose because it can mimic other diseases, such as Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.

The diagnosis of GITB is confirmed by a biopsy of the affected tissue. Treatment for GITB is with a combination of antibiotics. The prognosis for patients with GITB is good if they are treated early and appropriately.

The other options are incorrect because:

* Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a rare type of cancer that can occur in any part of the gastrointestinal tract. GIST is not typically associated with cachexia or chronic diarrhea.
* Gastrocolic fistula is an abnormal connection between the stomach and colon. Gastrocolic fistula can cause diarrhea, but it is not typically associated with cachexia.
* Gastric leiomyosarcoma is a rare type of cancer that can occur in the stomach. Gastric leiomyosarcoma is not typically associated with cachexia or chronic diarrhea.

Explanation:

The patient is a 28-year-old white man with a long-standing history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) that was only partially controlled with proton pump inhibitor therapy. He presented to the gastrointestinal (GI) medicine clinic for persistent nausea and vomiting. The symptoms were exacerbated by cessation of proton pump inhibitor medication, and he reported an associated 9-kg weight loss. Results of laboratory testing were significant for iron deficiency anemia (hematocrit, 31%) and hemeoccult-positive stool. Upper and lower endoscopy, computed tomography enterography, PillCam capsule endoscopy, and a Meckel scan failed to identify a source of GI bleeding. The patient received a retrograde double-balloon enteroscopy that showed an outpouching in the distal ileum (Figure, A) with an accompanying ulceration of the adjacent mucosa (Figure, B). Exploratory laparotomy with small-bowel resection was performed, and the gross specimen is shown in Figure, C.

A. Intestinal duplication is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by the presence of a duplicate segment of intestine that is lined with intestinal epithelium. It is usually located in the jejunum or ileum, and can be associated with other congenital anomalies, such as malrotation of the bowel. Intestinal duplications can be asymptomatic or can present with symptoms such as abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea. Treatment is surgical resection of the duplication.

B. Meckel diverticulum is a true diverticulum, which means that it is lined with all layers of the intestinal wall. It is the most common congenital anomaly of the gastrointestinal tract, and is found in approximately 2% of the population. Meckel diverticula are usually located in the distal ileum, and are often asymptomatic. However, they can present with symptoms such as abdominal pain, bleeding, and intussusception. Treatment is surgical resection of the diverticulum.

C. Gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) is a rare mesenchymal tumor that can arise from any part of the gastrointestinal tract. It is the most common mesenchymal tumor of the stomach, and is the second most common mesenchymal tumor of the small intestine. GISTs are usually diagnosed in adults, and are more common in men than women. The majority of GISTs are sporadic, but some are associated with genetic syndromes such as neurofibromatosis type 1 and Carney complex. GISTs can be asymptomatic or can present with symptoms such as abdominal pain, bleeding, and weight loss. Treatment is surgical resection, and adjuvant therapy with imatinib mesylate is recommended for patients with high-risk tumors.

D. Small-bowel diverticular disease is a condition characterized by the presence of diverticula in the small intestine. Diverticula are small pouches that can form in the lining of the intestine. Small-bowel diverticular disease is more common in older adults, and is more common in people with Crohn's disease. Small-bowel diverticula are usually asymptomatic, but can present with symptoms such as abdominal pain, bleeding, and obstruction. Treatment is usually conservative, but surgery may be necessary for complications such as bleeding or obstruction.

In the case presented, the patient is a young man with a history of GERD who presents with persistent nausea and vomiting, weight loss, and iron deficiency anemia. He has a negative workup for other causes of GI bleeding, and a retrograde double-balloon enteroscopy shows an outpouching in the distal ileum with an accompanying ulceration of the adjacent mucosa. The patient undergoes exploratory laparotomy with small-bowel resection, and the gross specimen shows a GIST. Based on this information, the most likely diagnosis is GIST.

Explanation:
The patient's history of sudden epigastric and right upper quadrant pain, which did not migrate during that period and occurred in paroxysms at 9- to 10-minute intervals, is consistent with a diagnosis of lesser sac (omental bursa) internal hernia through the epiploic foramen. The physical examination findings of mild tachycardia (96/min) and moderate abdominal distension without signs of peritonism are also consistent with this diagnosis. The blood analysis results showed mild leukocytosis (total white blood cell count, 10.5 × 103/μL) without elevation of the C-reactive protein level (<3 mg/L). Serum electrolyte levels were within the normal range. The computed tomography of the abdomen showed air-filled cecum in the lesser sac, which is a characteristic finding of lesser sac (omental bursa) internal hernia through the epiploic foramen.

A perforated ulcer of the posterior stomach wall is unlikely because the patient does not have a history of abdominal surgery. Abscess of the lesser sac (omental bursa) is unlikely because the patient does not have fever or other signs of infection. Large diverticle of the transverse colon is unlikely because the patient does not have a history of diverticulosis or diverticulitis.

Explanation:

The patient is a woman in her 70s who presented with numbness in her hands that had progressively worsened over the last 6 months. She did not have diabetes mellitus and she did not drink alcohol. On physical examination, she had no pallor, lymphadenopathy, or organomegaly. She had evidence of bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome (positive Phalen test and Tinel sign bilaterally) and reduced deep tendon reflexes in the upper and lower extremities bilaterally. Laboratory test results for complete blood cell count, serum calcium, serum creatinine, blood glucose, serum thyroid-stimulating hormone, and serum B12 were within normal limits. Because of unexplained neuropathy, a workup to detect an underlying monoclonal gammopathy was done, including serum protein electrophoresis, immunofixation, and free light chain assay.

The serum protein electrophoresis showed a monoclonal gammopathy in the beta-gamma region. The immunofixation showed that the monoclonal protein was of IgG kappa type. The free light chain assay showed an increased level of free kappa light chains.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of light chain monoclonal gammopathy. Light chain monoclonal gammopathy is a condition in which there is an increase in the number of plasma cells that produce a single type of light chain (kappa or lambda). This can lead to a variety of symptoms, including neuropathy, bone pain, and fatigue. In most cases, light chain monoclonal gammopathy is a benign condition that does not require treatment. However, in some cases, it can progress to a more serious condition, such as multiple myeloma or Waldenström macroglobulinemia.

The other possible diagnoses are all incorrect. Multiple myeloma is a condition in which there is an increase in the number of plasma cells that produce a monoclonal protein. This can lead to a variety of symptoms, including bone pain, anemia, and kidney failure. Waldenström macroglobulinemia is a condition in which there is an increase in the number of plasma cells that produce a monoclonal protein of IgM type. This can lead to a variety of symptoms, including lymphadenopathy, bleeding, and Raynaud's phenomenon.

Explanation:

The patient in this case has a rapidly progressing, painful ulceration on the left leg with intermittent high fevers. The lesion began as 2 sesame seed–sized violaceous, papulovesicular rashes with an erythematous halo on her left medial malleolus 12 days prior to presentation. Within 1 week, more papulovesicles appeared, merged, and ulcerated spontaneously. The ulceration expanded outwardly at a rapid pace, with increasing pain and a hemorrhagic exudative discharge. The lesion did not respond to treatment with systemic antibiotics, including vancomycin and meropenem. During the prior 5 months, she experienced mild diarrhea, which was ultimately diagnosed as Crohn disease by colonoscopy with biopsy.

The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of pyoderma gangrenosum (PG). PG is a rare, necrotizing skin condition that typically affects patients with underlying inflammatory bowel disease, such as Crohn disease. The most common presentation of PG is a painful, rapidly expanding ulcer with a violaceous border. The ulcers are often associated with fever, chills, and leukocytosis.

The mainstay of treatment for PG is surgical excision of the ulcer, followed by skin grafting. In some cases, systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications may also be necessary.

In this case, the patient's lesion has not responded to treatment with systemic antibiotics. This suggests that the lesion is not due to an infection, but rather to an underlying inflammatory process, such as PG. The patient's history of Crohn disease also supports the diagnosis of PG.

The best course of treatment for this patient is to surgically excise the lesion, followed by skin grafting. This will allow for the removal of the necrotic tissue and the creation of a healthy wound bed. Skin grafting will then help to cover the defect and promote healing.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Changing dressings daily and implementing hyperbaric oxygen therapy would not be effective in treating PG. Systemic corticosteroids may be helpful in some cases of PG, but they are not the first-line treatment. Broad-spectrum antibiotics are not indicated in this case, as the lesion is not due to an infection.

Explanation:
The patient has a history of hypertension, which is a risk factor for coronary artery disease. She presented with chest pain that is consistent with myocardial ischemia. The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and inferior T-wave inversion. LVH is a non-specific finding that can be seen in a variety of conditions, but it is often seen in patients with coronary artery disease. The inferior T-wave inversion is a more specific finding that is suggestive of myocardial ischemia. The laboratory values showed an elevated cardiac troponin T (cTnT) level. cTnT is a protein that is released from the heart muscle when it is damaged. An elevated cTnT level is highly specific for myocardial infarction. The echocardiogram showed moderate LVH with preserved left ventricular systolic function and no segmental wall motion abnormalities. This finding is consistent with a subendocardial myocardial infarction. The coronary angiography revealed only mild nonobstructive coronary artery disease with a 20% stenosis of the proximal left circumflex coronary artery. This finding is consistent with the patient's history of hypertension and her non-specific electrocardiogram findings. The most likely diagnosis is a type I non–ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI) due to atherosclerotic plaque rupture. A type I MI is caused by the rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque, which releases plaque material into the bloodstream and triggers a cascade of events that lead to myocardial ischemia and infarction. The patient's history of hypertension, her chest pain, her electrocardiogram findings, her elevated cTnT level, and her echocardiogram findings are all consistent with this diagnosis.

The other possible diagnoses are not as likely. A chronic elevation in cTnT due to LVH would not be expected to cause chest pain or an acute elevation in cTnT. An elevated cTnT due to skeletal muscle injury would not be expected to be associated with chest pain or an electrocardiogram with inferior T-wave inversion. A type II non–ST-elevation MI related to acute increase in myocardial oxygen demand would not be expected to be associated with a history of hypertension or an electrocardiogram with inferior T-wave inversion.

Explanation:
The patient's history and physical examination are consistent with a diagnosis of oral lichen planus, a chronic inflammatory condition of the oral mucosa. Oral lichen planus is characterized by white, lacy lesions on the oral mucosa. The lesions are usually asymptomatic, but they can be painful and cause difficulty eating and drinking.

The treatment of oral lichen planus is aimed at relieving symptoms and preventing complications. Treatment options include topical corticosteroids, oral corticosteroids, and immune modulators. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the lesions.

In this case, the patient's symptoms are severe and she has had the lesions for 7 years. Therefore, it is important to biopsy the affected tissue to rule out malignancy. If the biopsy is negative for malignancy, then the patient can be treated with topical corticosteroids or oral corticosteroids.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Valacyclovir is an antiviral medication that is used to treat herpes simplex virus infections. It would not be effective in treating oral lichen planus. Ordering a nutritional assay to evaluate for vitamin B3 (niacin) deficiency is not necessary in this case. The patient does not have any symptoms of vitamin B3 deficiency. Recommending increased use of an alcohol-based mouthwash to improve oral hygiene is not appropriate in this case. Alcohol-based mouthwashes can irritate the oral mucosa and make the lesions worse.

Lipoid proteinosis is a rare, genetic disorder that causes the buildup of a fatty substance called lipoid proteinosis in the skin, blood vessels, and internal organs. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including:

* Recurrent oral mucosal ulcers
* Gingival edema
* Pseudomembranous masses affecting conjunctival mucosa of the left eye consistent with ligneous conjunctivitis
* Aggregates of relatively amorphous, eosinophilic material beneath the epithelium and around blood vessels

The diagnosis of lipoid proteinosis is made based on a clinical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests. Treatment is supportive and may include medications to manage the symptoms.

Amyloidosis is a group of diseases in which abnormal proteins build up in organs and tissues throughout the body. It can cause a variety of symptoms, depending on the organs that are affected.

Systemic sclerosis is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the skin, connective tissues, and blood vessels. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including:

* Raynaud's phenomenon
* Sclerodactyly
* Telangiectasias
* Esophageal dysmotility
* Pulmonary hypertension

Hypoplasminogenemia is a rare inherited disorder characterized by a deficiency of plasminogen, a protein that is essential for blood clotting. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including:

* Easy bruising
* Prolonged bleeding
* Menorrhagia
* Postpartum hemorrhage

In conclusion, the diagnosis of this case is lipoid proteinosis. This is supported by the patient's history of recurrent oral mucosal ulcers, gingival edema, ligneous conjunctivitis, and biopsy findings of aggregates of relatively amorphous, eosinophilic material beneath the epithelium and around blood vessels. Amyloidosis, systemic sclerosis, and hypoplasminogenemia are all possible diagnoses, but they are less likely given the patient's presentation.

Explanation:

Neonatal pemphigus vulgaris is a rare, life-threatening autoimmune blistering disorder that can occur in newborns. It is characterized by the development of flaccid blisters and erosions on the skin and mucous membranes. The diagnosis is confirmed by direct immunofluorescence, which shows IgG and C3 deposits in the intercellular spaces of the epidermis. The treatment of neonatal pemphigus vulgaris is with high-dose corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive agents.

In the case presented, the neonate exhibited extensive erosions rimmed by purulent vesicles involving the groin, neck, scalp, fingers, and left side of the upper chest. Mucous membranes were spared. Biopsy specimens were obtained, with results as shown in the figure. The histopathologic analysis of truncal skin sample demonstrated suprabasilar acantholysis with an eosinophil-rich infiltrate. The direct immunofluorescence of perilesional skin from the right side of the chest demonstrated IgG in an intracellular “chicken wire” pattern involving the lower spinous layer. These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of neonatal pemphigus vulgaris.

The other possible diagnoses can be excluded based on the following findings:

* Epidermolysis bullosa, Dowling-Meara type is a genetic blistering disorder characterized by the development of flaccid blisters and erosions in areas of friction or trauma. It is not an autoimmune disorder, and direct immunofluorescence is negative.
* Neonatal herpesvirus infection is a viral infection that can cause a variety of skin lesions, including vesicles, erosions, and ulcers. The diagnosis is confirmed by viral culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
* Widespread bullous impetigo is a bacterial infection of the skin that can cause the development of flaccid blisters and erosions. The diagnosis is confirmed by bacterial culture.

Explanation:
The patient's history and physical examination are most consistent with a diagnosis of neutrophilic sebaceous adenitis (NSA). NSA is a rare, self-limiting inflammatory disorder of the sebaceous glands. It typically presents as annular plaques with raised erythematous-violaceous borders, often on the face and upper torso. The lesions may be pruritic or painful, and they may resolve spontaneously or with treatment.

The histopathologic findings of NSA are characteristic. The lesions show sebaceous lobules with sebocyte necrosis and an associated neutrophilic infiltrate that also includes scattered lymphomononuclear cells. These findings are in contrast to those of granuloma annulare, which shows palisading granulomas, and cutaneous lupus, which shows perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates. Erythema annulare centrifugum, deep variant, is a rare variant of erythema annulare centrifugum that presents with deep, indurated plaques.

Erythema ab igne is a skin condition that is caused by long-term exposure to heat, such as from a heating pad or fireplace. It is characterized by a reticulated, erythematous plaque with micaceous and silvery scale. The biopsy findings in this case are consistent with erythema ab igne, including mild hyperkeratosis overlying an epidermis with dysmaturation and apoptotic cells, increased small blood vessels, pigment incontinence, and perivascular inflammation with lymphocytes and eosinophils. In addition, the patient's history of sitting in front of a fireplace for long periods of time is consistent with the diagnosis of erythema ab igne.

Psoriasis vulgaris is a chronic autoimmune disease that is characterized by the rapid production of skin cells. It is characterized by well-demarcated, erythematous plaques with silvery scale. The biopsy findings in this case are not consistent with psoriasis, as there is no evidence of parakeratosis or Munro microabscesses.

Pityriasis rubra pilaris is a rare, chronic skin disorder that is characterized by scaling, erythema, and follicular plugging. It is characterized by large, well-demarcated, erythematous plaques with micaceous and silvery scale. The biopsy findings in this case are not consistent with pityriasis rubra pilaris, as there is no evidence of follicular plugging.

Cutaneous lupus erythematosus is an autoimmune disease that can affect the skin, joints, and other organs. It is characterized by a variety of skin lesions, including erythematous macules, papules, and plaques. The biopsy findings in this case are not consistent with cutaneous lupus erythematosus, as there is no evidence of perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with mucin deposition.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is erythema ab igne with superimposed chemotherapy effect.

Explanation:
The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus type 2, hypertension, and a transient ischemic attack 4 years earlier. He presented with sudden-onset paracentral vision loss in his left eye. On examination, visual acuity measured 20/60 OS, improving to 20/40 with pinhole. A complete blood cell count, results of a comprehensive metabolic panel, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein level, and computed tomography of the head without contrast were all normal. Review of systems was negative. Ocular history included penetrating keratoplasty with intraocular lens exchange and Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty in the right eye. Four days later in the Retina Clinic, visual acuity was unchanged. Slitlamp examination of the anterior segment was normal. Ophthalmoscopy revealed no vitreous cells, a posterior vitreous separation, cup-disc ratio of 0.3, normal retinal vessels, and a superior parafoveal crescent of translucent retina without associated edema or hemorrhage. The peripheral retina was normal. Fundus autofluorescence and fluorescein angiogram showed abnormalities in the superior macula.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC). CSC is a common, idiopathic disorder of the outer retina that typically affects young to middle-aged adults. It is characterized by the accumulation of fluid in the subretinal space, which can cause a scotoma (blind spot) in the central vision. The exact cause of CSC is unknown, but it is thought to be related to a breakdown in the blood-retinal barrier.

The treatment of CSC is typically aimed at reducing the amount of fluid in the subretinal space. This can be done with laser therapy, photodynamic therapy, or intravitreal injection of a corticosteroid. The goal of treatment is to improve visual acuity and prevent recurrence.

In the case of the patient in the question, the most appropriate next step is to obtain optical coherence tomography (OCT). OCT is a non-invasive imaging technique that can be used to assess the structure of the retina. In CSC, OCT can show the presence of fluid in the subretinal space, as well as any associated retinal changes. OCT can also be used to monitor the response to treatment.

The other options are not as appropriate for this patient. A: Perform ocular ultrasonography is not as sensitive as OCT for detecting changes in the retina. C: Obtain blood tests for vasculitis workup is not necessary, as there is no evidence of vasculitis in this patient. D: Administer intravitreal injection of an anti–vascular endothelial growth factor agent is not the first-line treatment for CSC.

The patient has acute postoperative visual loss and ophthalmoplegia in the right eye. The fundus examination is significant for diffuse retinal whitening with a cherry-red spot in the right eye. This is a classic presentation of posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES), which is a reversible disorder of the brain characterized by vasogenic edema and hypertension. PRES is most commonly seen in patients with severe hypertension, but it can also occur in patients with other medical conditions, such as preeclampsia, eclampsia, and kidney disease.

The treatment for PRES is to control the blood pressure and to remove the underlying cause of the hypertension. In some cases, surgical intervention may be necessary to decompress the brain. In this case, the patient should undergo immediate surgical re-exploration to rule out a postoperative hematoma or other surgical complication. If a hematoma is found, it should be evacuated immediately. If no hematoma is found, the patient should be treated for PRES with antihypertensive medications and close monitoring.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* B. Emergent angiography is not necessary in this case. The patient has already had a CT scan without contrast, which did not show an acute intracranial hemorrhage. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and orbits with contrast also showed no evidence of a vascular malformation or other cause of intracranial hemorrhage.
* C. Immediate anticoagulation is not necessary in this case. The patient does not have any signs or symptoms of a thromboembolic event. In addition, anticoagulation could worsen the patient's PRES by increasing the risk of bleeding.
* D. Lateral canthotomy and cantholysis are not necessary in this case. These procedures are used to relieve pressure on the optic nerve in patients with orbital compartment syndrome. However, the patient does not have any signs or symptoms of orbital compartment syndrome.

Explanation:

A dermoid cyst is a type of cyst that is formed from skin cells. It is usually filled with sebum, hair, and other skin debris. Dermoid cysts are most common on the head, neck, and upper trunk. They are usually benign (noncancerous).

In this case, the newborn presented with a chest mass that was found on initial examination in the nursery. The mass was firm and round, and it was not homogeneous or smooth. There was no discoloration of the overlying skin. These findings are consistent with a dermoid cyst.

Infantile hemangiomas are benign tumors that are made up of blood vessels. They are the most common type of tumor in newborns. Infantile hemangiomas usually appear within the first few weeks of life, and they often disappear on their own within a few years.

Neuroblastoma is a rare type of cancer that starts in nerve cells. It is the most common type of cancer in children under the age of 15. Neuroblastoma can occur anywhere in the body, but it is most common in the abdomen.

Infantile myofibroma is a rare type of tumor that is made up of muscle cells. It is most common in infants and young children. Infantile myofibromas are usually benign, but they can sometimes be cancerous.

In this case, the newborn's chest mass is most likely a dermoid cyst. Dermoid cysts are the most common type of cyst in newborns, and they are usually benign. The newborn's chest mass is also consistent with the clinical presentation of a dermoid cyst.

Explanation:
The patient's history of occupational exposure to asbestos and the presence of dilated small intestine with air-fluid levels extending to the terminal ileum on computed tomography scan are consistent with sclerosing encapsulated peritonitis (SEP). SEP is a rare, chronic, fibrosing disorder of the peritoneum that is characterized by the deposition of dense, collagenous tissue. The cause of SEP is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune disorder. SEP can occur spontaneously, or it can be secondary to other conditions, such as asbestos exposure, abdominal surgery, or inflammatory bowel disease.

The clinical presentation of SEP is variable, but patients typically present with abdominal pain, distention, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss. Physical examination may reveal a distended abdomen with tenderness and ascites. Laboratory tests may show an elevated white blood cell count and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Abdominal imaging studies, such as computed tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging, can show the characteristic findings of SEP, which include thickened, fibrotic peritoneum and obliteration of the peritoneal recesses.

The treatment of SEP is challenging and there is no cure. Treatment options include surgery, steroids, and immunosuppressive drugs. Surgery may be necessary to relieve obstruction or to remove necrotic bowel. Steroids and immunosuppressive drugs may be used to reduce inflammation and fibrosis. The prognosis for patients with SEP is poor, and most patients die within 5 years of diagnosis.

The other options are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's clinical presentation and imaging findings. Peritoneal mesothelioma is a rare, malignant tumor of the peritoneum that is associated with asbestos exposure. Malrotation with Ladd bands is a congenital anomaly of the intestines that is characterized by abnormal rotation of the midgut and the presence of bands that can obstruct the small intestine.

They are usually benign (noncancerous), but can sometimes spread to other parts of the body. Carcinoid tumors can cause a variety of symptoms, including abdominal pain, diarrhea, flushing, and wheezing.

The patient in this case has a history of gastrointestinal bleeding and melena, which are symptoms that are consistent with a carcinoid tumor. The patient also has a large, complex, septated, right-upper-quadrant abdominal mass, which is a characteristic finding of a carcinoid tumor.

The other possible answers are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are also rare, slow-growing tumors that usually start in the gastrointestinal tract. However, they are more likely to be malignant (cancerous) than carcinoid tumors. GISTs do not usually cause the symptoms that the patient in this case is experiencing.
* Neurofibromas are benign tumors that usually start in the nerves. They are not associated with gastrointestinal bleeding or melena.
* Intra-abdominal abscesses are collections of pus that form in the abdomen. They are usually caused by infection with bacteria. Intra-abdominal abscesses do not usually cause the symptoms that the patient in this case is experiencing.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis for the patient in this case is a carcinoid tumor.

 93%|█████████▎| 1413/1525 [5:22:27<26:25, 14.15s/it]The correct answer is: A. The patient has asymptomatic pyuria and bacteriuria.

Asymptomatic pyuria is the presence of white blood cells in the urine in the absence of symptoms. Bacteriuria is the presence of bacteria in the urine. Both of these conditions can be found in people with urinary tract infections (UTIs), but they can also be found in people who do not have UTIs.

In this case, the patient has a history of recurrent UTIs, but she does not currently have any symptoms of a UTI. Her urinalysis shows pyuria and bacteriuria, but her urine culture does not show any growth of bacteria. This suggests that she has asymptomatic pyuria and bacteriuria, rather than a UTI.

Asymptomatic pyuria and bacteriuria are common in older adults, especially those who are institutionalized. They are not usually harmful, but they can sometimes lead to UTIs. If the patient's symptoms worsen or if her urinalysis or urine culture changes, she should be evaluated for a UTI.

B is incorrect because the patient does not have any symptoms of a UTI. C is incorrect because a positive urinalysis and urine culture are not always a UTI. D is incorrect because the patient's history of recurrent UTIs does not necessarily mean that she has another UTI.

The patient has multiple ring-enhancing cystic brain lesions, which are most consistent with bacterial abscesses. The most likely pathogen is Listeria monocytogenes, which is a gram-positive rod that is commonly found in soil and water. It is a common cause of meningitis and brain abscesses in elderly patients, particularly those with underlying medical conditions such as hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and diabetes mellitus.

The initial management of brain abscesses is with intravenous antibiotics, such as ceftriaxone, vancomycin, and metronidazole. These antibiotics provide broad-spectrum coverage against a variety of potential pathogens, including Listeria monocytogenes. The patient should also be treated for any underlying medical conditions that may have contributed to the development of the brain abscesses.

In some cases, surgical drainage of the brain abscess may be necessary. However, this is usually only necessary if the abscess is large or if it is causing significant neurological symptoms.

The prognosis for patients with brain abscesses is generally good if they are treated promptly and aggressively. With appropriate treatment, most patients will make a full recovery. However, some patients may experience long-term neurological sequelae, such as seizures or cognitive impairment.

The other options are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate management for a patient with bacterial brain abscesses.

* Option B, perform a lumbar puncture, is incorrect because it is not necessary to diagnose a brain abscess. The diagnosis can be made with a CT scan or MRI of the brain.
* Option C, consult neurosurgery for biopsy, is incorrect because biopsy is not necessary to diagnose a brain abscess. The diagnosis can be made with a CT scan or MRI of the brain.
* Option D, start systemic corticosteroids, is incorrect because corticosteroids are not recommended for the treatment of brain abscesses. In fact, corticosteroids may actually worsen the infection.

Explanation: The most likely diagnosis is cutaneous larva migrans (CLM), which is a skin infection caused by the larvae of certain nematodes (roundworms). CLM is a common infection in travelers to tropical and subtropical regions, including Puerto Rico. The typical presentation is a linear, serpiginous eruption with associated pruritus. The diagnosis is made clinically, but skin biopsy can be helpful in some cases. Treatment is with oral anthelmintic therapy, such as albendazole or ivermectin.

A. Do nothing; it will resolve with time is incorrect because CLM is a self-limiting infection, but it can take several weeks to resolve without treatment. In addition, untreated CLM can lead to secondary bacterial infections.

B. Prescribe topical steroids is incorrect because topical steroids are not effective against CLM. In fact, they can worsen the infection by suppressing the immune system.

D. Prescribe oral antibiotics is incorrect because CLM is a parasitic infection, not a bacterial infection. Antibiotics are not effective against parasites.

Explanation:
The patient's IGRA results are negative, which means that she does not have LTBI. The IGRA is a more specific test than the TST, and it is not affected by BCG vaccination. The patient's chest radiograph is also unremarkable, which further supports the diagnosis of no LTBI. Therefore, no further evaluation is needed.

The patient's TST result is positive, but this is not necessarily indicative of LTBI. The TST can be positive for a number of reasons, including BCG vaccination, previous exposure to TB, and active TB disease. In this case, the patient's IGRA results are negative, which indicates that she does not have LTBI. The patient's chest radiograph is also unremarkable, which further supports the diagnosis of no LTBI. Therefore, the patient's positive TST result is most likely due to her BCG vaccination.

The patient does not have active TB disease. The patient's chest radiograph is unremarkable, and she has no symptoms. Active TB disease is usually associated with a positive chest radiograph and symptoms such as cough, fever, and night sweats.

The patient does not need further evaluation for active TB disease. The patient's IGRA results are negative, which indicates that she does not have LTBI. The patient's chest radiograph is also unremarkable, which further supports the diagnosis of no LTBI. Therefore, no further evaluation is needed.

Explanation:

Cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) is a rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that affects the skin. It is characterized by the presence of large, atypical lymphocytes in the skin. The diagnosis of ALCL is made on the basis of a biopsy of the skin lesion.

The patient in the case presented has a rapidly enlarging nodular plaque on his calf, thigh, and cheek. This is consistent with the clinical presentation of ALCL. The patient also has an elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, which is a non-specific finding that can be seen in a variety of lymphomas.

The histopathologic images from the punch biopsy specimen show angiocentrism, which is a characteristic feature of ALCL. The atypical lymphocytic infiltrate is strongly positive for EBV-encoded RNA in situ hybridization, which is another characteristic feature of ALCL.

In conclusion, the patient in the case presented has the clinical, laboratory, and histopathologic features of cutaneous ALCL. The diagnosis of ALCL is supported by the positive EBER in situ hybridization. The other possible diagnoses (extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type, blastomycosis, and subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma) are less likely given the patient's presentation and the histopathologic findings.

HHT is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of telangiectasias (dilated blood vessels) throughout the body. The telangiectasias can occur in the skin, mucous membranes, gastrointestinal tract, and lungs. HHT is associated with a variety of complications, including bleeding, stroke, and brain abscess.

The patient in the case presentation has a history of progressive widespread cutaneous telangiectasias. She also has a family history of HHT. The physical examination reveals punctate, blanchable telangiectasias coalescing to form large, retiform patches on her bilateral lower extremities, feet, and upper extremities. There is no conjunctival or mucosal involvement. The patient reports no dermatographism or purpura. The histologic findings from a biopsy specimen show dilated, ectatic vessels in the superficial dermis with no associated inflammation or fibrinoid necrosis.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of HHT. The other options are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings.

* **B. Cutaneous collagenous vasculopathy** is a rare disorder characterized by the development of telangiectasias and fibrosis in the skin. It is not associated with a family history of telangiectasias.

 93%|█████████▎| 1419/1525 [5:23:40<23:53, 13.52s/it]The correct answer is C: Langerhans cell histiocytosis.

Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare disorder characterized by the proliferation of Langerhans cells, a type of white blood cell. LCH can affect any part of the body, but it most commonly affects the skin, bones, and lymph nodes.

The classic presentation of LCH is a skin rash that appears as red, scaly patches. The rash may be itchy or painful, and it may crust or bleed. In some cases, the rash may spread to other parts of the body, such as the scalp, groin, and armpits.

LCH can also cause bone pain, swelling, and fractures. In some cases, the disease can affect the lymph nodes, liver, spleen, or other organs.

The diagnosis of LCH is made based on a physical examination, a history of the patient's symptoms, and laboratory tests. A biopsy of the affected skin or tissue may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

There is no cure for LCH, but the disease can be treated with a variety of medications, including steroids, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. The treatment for LCH depends on the severity of the disease and the organs that are affected.

In the case of the woman in the prompt, the history of tender, reddish brown, slightly pruritic papules and plaques on the scalp, in the inframammary region, and in the perineum that had been present for approximately 1 year, along with the physical examination findings of well-demarcated, moist, erythematous plaques and erosions in the bilateral inframammary regions and the intertriginous regions of the groin and scattered excoriated papules on the scalp, are consistent with a diagnosis of LCH. The punch biopsy specimen of the plaque along the left inframammary region showing abundant atypical cells within the epidermis and papillary dermis with reniform nuclei is also consistent with a diagnosis of LCH.

The other possible diagnoses, intertrigo, Hailey-Hailey disease, and inverse psoriasis, are all less likely in this case. Intertrigo is a common skin infection that occurs in areas of the skin where there is skin-to-skin contact, such as the armpits, groin, and under the breasts. It is characterized by red, itchy, and irritated skin. Hailey-Hailey disease is a rare genetic disorder that causes the skin to blister and peel. It is most commonly seen in people of Mediterranean descent. Inverse psoriasis is a type of psoriasis that affects the skin folds, such as the armpits, groin, and under the breasts. It is characterized by red, scaly, and inflamed skin.

In conclusion, the correct answer is C: Langerhans cell histiocytosis. The other possible diagnoses, intertrigo, Hailey-Hailey disease, and inverse psoriasis, are all less likely in this case.

 93%|█████████▎| 1420/1525 [5:23:53<23:14, 13.28s/it]The correct answer is: A. Reassure and observe.

The patient in this case has a history of blunt trauma to the right eye secondary to airbag deployment. On examination, she has decreased visual acuity in the right eye, as well as whitening of the macula with a central red spot, flame-shaped hemorrhages, and cotton-wool spots. These findings are consistent with posterior pole commotio retinae. Posterior pole commotio retinae is a non-ischemic retinal injury that is caused by blunt trauma to the eye. It is a self-limiting condition, and most patients will have complete resolution of their visual symptoms within 6-12 months.

In the acute setting, there is no specific treatment for posterior pole commotio retinae. Patients should be reassured that their vision is likely to improve over time. They should also be advised to avoid activities that could further injure their eye, such as contact sports.

In the patient in this case, the visual acuity has improved from 20/200 to 20/30 over the course of 10 weeks. This is a good sign, and it suggests that the patient is likely to continue to improve. Therefore, the best course of management is to reassure the patient and observe her over time.

The other options are incorrect because they are not appropriate for the management of posterior pole commotio retinae.

Option B, OCT imaging, is not necessary in the acute setting. OCT can be used to monitor the progression of posterior pole commotio retinae, but it is not necessary to make the diagnosis or to guide treatment.

Option C, evaluate for secondary gain, is not appropriate in this case. There is no evidence that the patient is malingering or exaggerating her symptoms.

Option D, electroretinogram, is not necessary in the acute setting. Electroretinogram can be used to assess retinal function, but it is not necessary to make the diagnosis or to guide treatment of posterior pole commotio retinae.

The patient in this case has bilateral neuroretinitis and retinal hemorrhages. Neuroretinitis is an inflammation of the optic nerve and retina, and retinal hemorrhages are bleeding in the retina. Both of these findings are consistent with an infectious process, such as an infection with a virus or bacteria.

In order to determine the cause of the patient's infection, the doctor would order neuroimaging of the brain and orbits. Neuroimaging can help to identify any lesions or abnormalities in the brain or orbits that could be causing the patient's symptoms.

Blood cultures can also be helpful in diagnosing an infection, but they are not as specific as neuroimaging. Blood cultures can identify the specific bacteria or virus that is causing the infection, but they cannot identify the location of the infection.

Anterior chamber paracentesis for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a procedure that is used to collect fluid from the anterior chamber of the eye. PCR is a test that can be used to identify specific DNA sequences. In this case, PCR could be used to identify the DNA of a virus or bacteria that is causing the patient's infection. However, anterior chamber paracentesis is a more invasive procedure than neuroimaging, and it is not always necessary to diagnose an infection.

Therefore, the best next step in the management of this patient is to order neuroimaging of the brain and orbits. This will help to determine the cause of the patient's infection and to guide further treatment.

Explanation:

The patient is an 8-year-old girl who presented with a lesion over the right posterior thigh that had been present since she was 3 months old. The lesion was originally diagnosed as a hemangioma and was treated with observation. However, it has continued to expand and is now causing cosmetic concerns, as well as irritation and bleeding. The patient denies pain or itching. A 4-mm punch biopsy was performed, which showed dilated thin-walled vascular spaces containing valvelike papillary projections in the superficial dermis. The overlying epidermis shows acanthosis and hyperkeratosis.

The clinical presentation and histopathologic findings are consistent with a diagnosis of microcystic lymphatic malformation. Microcystic lymphatic malformations are benign vascular malformations that are characterized by dilated lymphatic channels in the dermis. They are most commonly found on the head and neck, but can occur anywhere on the body. The lesions can be small and asymptomatic, or they can be large and symptomatic, causing pain, swelling, and infection.

The treatment of microcystic lymphatic malformations is typically conservative, with observation and treatment of symptoms. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the lesion.

The other possible diagnoses are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Congenital melanocytic nevus is a type of birthmark that is caused by an abnormal proliferation of melanocytes. It is usually present at birth and can be of any size or shape. Congenital melanocytic nevi can be benign or malignant.
* Venous malformation is a type of vascular malformation that is characterized by dilated veins. It can be present at birth or develop later in life. Venous malformations can be small and asymptomatic, or they can be large and symptomatic, causing pain, swelling, and bleeding.
* Nevus sebaceous is a type of benign skin lesion that is characterized by a raised, hairless patch of skin. It is usually present at birth and can be of any size or shape. Nevus sebaceous can develop into a basal cell carcinoma, a type of skin cancer, in rare cases.

The patient is a 75-year-old woman with a history of hypertension and a previous laparoscopic cholecystectomy. She presents with abdominal pain and jaundice. On physical examination, she has a palpable abdominal mass. Laboratory tests show an elevated total bilirubin level, aspartate aminotransferase level, alanine transaminase level, and alkaline phosphatase level. Imaging studies reveal a 3 × 4-cm circumferential lesion in the second and third portions of the duodenum involving the pancreatic head, as well as multiple nodules along the peritoneal reflection of the right paracolic gutter.

The most likely diagnosis is peritoneal carcinomatosis. Peritoneal carcinomatosis is a condition in which cancer cells spread to the peritoneum, the thin membrane that lines the abdominal cavity. It is a common complication of advanced cancer, particularly ovarian cancer, colorectal cancer, and stomach cancer. The most common symptoms of peritoneal carcinomatosis are abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and weight loss.

The diagnosis of peritoneal carcinomatosis is made based on the patient's history, physical examination, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. Imaging studies, such as CT scans or MRI scans, can help to identify the presence of cancer cells in the peritoneum. There is no cure for peritoneal carcinomatosis, but there are treatments that can help to control the symptoms and improve the quality of life. Treatment options include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.

The other possible diagnoses are incorrect because they do not explain the patient's symptoms and imaging findings. Dropped gallstones are small pieces of gallstones that can pass through the bile duct and into the small intestine. They can cause abdominal pain, but they do not cause jaundice. Lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymph nodes. It can cause abdominal pain, but it does not cause jaundice or elevated liver enzymes. Peritoneal mesothelioma is a rare type of cancer that affects the lining of the abdominal cavity. It can cause abdominal pain, but it does not cause jaundice or elevated liver enzymes.

Explanation:

Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a rare, benign mesenchymal tumor that typically occurs in children and young adults. It is characterized by a proliferation of spindle-shaped cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and a storiform growth pattern. The tumor is often associated with inflammation, which is reflected in its name.

IMT can occur in any part of the body, but it is most common in the abdomen, chest, and retroperitoneum. It is usually a solitary mass, but it can also be multifocal. The tumor is typically slow-growing and asymptomatic. However, it can sometimes cause pain, swelling, or other symptoms.

The diagnosis of IMT is made on the basis of clinical presentation, imaging studies, and biopsy. Imaging studies typically show a well-circumscribed mass that is isointense or hypointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images. The mass may show enhancement after contrast administration.

Biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosis. The biopsy specimen typically shows a proliferation of spindle-shaped cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and a storiform growth pattern. The tumor cells are positive for actin and negative for S100 and desmin.

The treatment of IMT is surgical excision. The tumor is usually cured with complete excision. However, if the tumor is not completely excised, it may recur.

The prognosis for IMT is excellent. The tumor is typically slow-growing and benign. However, there is a small risk of recurrence, especially if the tumor is not completely excised.

The other options are incorrect because they are all malignant tumors. Desmoid fibromatosis is a rare, locally aggressive mesenchymal tumor that typically occurs in the abdomen, chest, and retroperitoneum. Leiomyosarcoma is a rare, malignant tumor of smooth muscle cells. Nodular fasciitis is a benign, reactive lesion that is often mistaken for a neoplasm.

Explanation:
The patient has a history of travel to the rainforests of Salto Ángel, Venezuela, where leishmaniasis is endemic. The patient's skin lesions are consistent with leishmaniasis, and the biopsy findings of pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia and lymphoplasmocytic inflammation are also consistent with leishmaniasis. The gold standard for the diagnosis of leishmaniasis is polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of biopsied tissue. PCR testing is highly sensitive and specific for leishmaniasis, and it can be used to identify the specific species of Leishmania that is causing the infection. This information is important for selecting the appropriate treatment.

A. Obtain immunofluorescence of biopsied tissue.
Immunofluorescence is a technique that can be used to detect the presence of specific antigens in tissue. However, immunofluorescence is not as sensitive or specific as PCR testing for the diagnosis of leishmaniasis.

B. Perform biopsy with oncology consultation.
A biopsy with oncology consultation is not necessary in this case. The patient's skin lesions are consistent with leishmaniasis, and the biopsy findings of pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia and lymphoplasmocytic inflammation are also consistent with leishmaniasis. The gold standard for the diagnosis of leishmaniasis is PCR testing of biopsied tissue.

D. Prescribe intravenous vancomycin for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infection.
Vancomycin is an antibiotic that is used to treat methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections. However, the patient's skin lesions are not consistent with MRSA infection. The patient's history of travel to the rainforests of Salto Ángel, Venezuela, where leishmaniasis is endemic, and the biopsy findings of pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia and lymphoplasmocytic inflammation are more consistent with leishmaniasis.

Flow cytometry is a technique that uses a laser to measure the physical and chemical properties of individual cells as they flow past a detector. It can be used to identify and quantify different types of cells, as well as to measure the expression of specific proteins on cell surfaces.

In this case, the patient has a lymphocytic predominance in his peripheral blood smear. This suggests that he may have a lymphoproliferative disorder, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Flow cytometry can be used to confirm the diagnosis of CLL and to subtype the disease. It can also be used to monitor the patient's response to treatment.

A mononucleosis test would not be helpful in this case, as the patient does not have any of the typical symptoms of mononucleosis, such as fever, sore throat, and lymphadenopathy. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest and abdomen with contrast would not be helpful in this case, as it would not be able to detect a lymphoproliferative disorder.

Excisional lymph node biopsy is a surgical procedure that involves removing a lymph node from the body. It is usually performed to diagnose a suspected cancer. In this case, the patient does not have any evidence of cancer, so an excisional lymph node biopsy would not be necessary.

Therefore, the best next step in the management of this patient is to order a flow cytometry of the peripheral blood sample. This will help to confirm the diagnosis of CLL and to subtype the disease. It can also be used to monitor the patient's response to treatment.

Explanation:

The patient is a woman in her 50s with a medical history of asthma and seasonal allergies who presented with numerous asymptomatic flesh-colored to translucent papules on her palms and palmar and lateral aspects of her fingers. Many of the papules were depressed centrally. There was no extension onto the dorsal aspect of the hands. There were similar translucent papules over the margins of her feet, particularly her great toes, and hyperkeratotic yellow plaques with scattered pits over her bilateral soles, concentrated in areas of pressure. The lesions on her hands first developed in her 40s and were exacerbated by alcohol-based hand sanitizer at work. They became more prominent with exposure to water but remained asymptomatic. Occasional application of urea cream to her feet did not lead to significant improvement. She also had fine-textured hair, present since childhood with thinning noted in the past 7 years. She had no history of eczema. At the time, she denied a family history of similar skin findings but recently reported similar hand and foot findings in her mother. Two punch biopsies were performed from the left thenar eminence.

The clinical features of the patient's lesions are most consistent with hereditary papulotranslucent acrokeratoderma (HTA). HTA is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by the development of asymptomatic, flesh-colored to translucent papules on the palms, soles, and other acral surfaces. The papules are often depressed centrally and may be associated with hyperkeratosis and pitting. The lesions are typically first seen in childhood or adolescence and may worsen with age. There is no effective treatment for HTA, but the lesions are usually benign and self-limited.

The other options are incorrect because they do not fit the patient's clinical presentation. Dyshidrotic pemphigoid is a chronic autoimmune blistering disorder that typically affects the palms and soles. The lesions of dyshidrotic pemphigoid are vesicles and bullae that are often intensely pruritic. Epidermolysis bullosa simplex is a group of inherited blistering disorders that are characterized by fragility of the skin and mucosa. The lesions of epidermolysis bullosa simplex are blisters and erosions that are often painful and recurrent. Dyshidrotic eczema is a common skin condition that is characterized by the development of small, itchy blisters on the palms and soles. The lesions of dyshidrotic eczema are often associated with redness, scaling, and fissuring.

Sweet syndrome is a rare, febrile neutrophilic dermatosis that is characterized by the sudden onset of fever, tender erythematous plaques or nodules, and leukocytosis. It is most commonly seen in middle-aged women, and it is often associated with an underlying medical condition, such as malignancy, infection, or inflammatory bowel disease.

The patient in the case presented with fever, rigors, periorbital swelling, and a painful perivulvar eruption 7 days after her first cycle of chemotherapy for newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML). She also had a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and hypercholesterolemia. Her regular medications included metformin, insulin, rosuvastatin calcium, levothyroxine sodium, and aspirin. Examination revealed edematous labia and multiple perivulvar tender nodules on violaceous and indurated plaques sparing the vaginal mucosa and inguinal creases. She also had bilateral injected conjunctivae with periorbital swelling. A punch biopsy of the perivulvar lesions was performed for histopathologic analysis and tissue culture.

The histopathologic findings of Sweet syndrome are characteristic, and they include a dense neutrophilic infiltrate in the dermis, with leukocytoclasia and fibrinoid necrosis. The eccrine glands may also be involved, with necrosis and destruction of the glandular epithelium.

The diagnosis of Sweet syndrome is typically made based on the clinical presentation and the histopathologic findings. In some cases, a skin biopsy may be necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment is generally supportive, with the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or corticosteroids. In severe cases, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) or cyclophosphamide may be used.

Herpes genitalis is an infection caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). It is characterized by the development of painful, grouped vesicles on the genital skin or mucous membranes. The diagnosis is typically made based on the clinical presentation and the results of a viral culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. Treatment is with antiviral medications such as acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir.

Deep fungal or atypical mycobacterial infection is a rare infection that can affect the skin, lungs, and other organs. It is typically seen in immunocompromised patients, such as those with AIDS or cancer. The diagnosis is typically made based on the clinical presentation, the results of laboratory tests, and the results of a biopsy. Treatment is with antifungal or antimycobacterial medications.

Perivulvar neutrophilic eccrine hidradenitis is a rare, inflammatory condition that affects the eccrine glands in the perivulvar area. It is characterized by the development of painful, erythematous nodules or plaques. The diagnosis is typically made based on the clinical presentation and the results of a biopsy. Treatment is with topical or oral corticosteroids.

In conclusion, the patient in the case presented with a clinical picture and histopathologic findings that are consistent with Sweet syndrome. The other options are less likely diagnoses.

Porokeratosis ptychotropica is a rare, chronic, autosomal dominant skin disorder characterized by well-demarcated, hyperkeratotic papules and plaques on the sun-exposed skin. The lesions are usually asymptomatic, but they may be pruritic. The diagnosis is made by biopsy. There is no cure for porokeratosis ptychotropica, but the lesions can be treated with topical corticosteroids, retinoids, or lasers.

The patient in the case presented with multiple hyperkeratotic purplish brown papules and plaques on both buttocks, more confluent in the perianal area, with well-demarcated slightly elevated keratotic margins. This is consistent with the clinical presentation of porokeratosis ptychotropica. The patient also had a history of heterologous bone marrow transplantation, which is a risk factor for porokeratosis ptychotropica. The dermoscopic findings of structureless brownish pigmentation and erythema in the center, demarcated by a white-yellow hyperkeratotic scale at the periphery are also consistent with porokeratosis ptychotropica. The biopsy specimen showed a characteristic perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate in the papillary dermis with a sharply demarcated band of parakeratosis at the epidermal-dermal junction. This is also consistent with the diagnosis of porokeratosis ptychotropica.

Psoriasis is a chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by well-demarcated, erythematous plaques covered with silvery scales. The lesions are usually found on the elbows, knees, scalp, and lower back. Psoriasis is not caused by a virus or bacteria, and it is not contagious. The exact cause of psoriasis is unknown, but it is thought to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. There is no cure for psoriasis, but the lesions can be treated with topical corticosteroids, retinoids, or light therapy.

Lichen planus is a chronic, autoimmune skin disease characterized by flat-topped, purplish papules and plaques. The lesions are usually found on the inside of the mouth, on the genitals, and on the skin. Lichen planus is not caused by a virus or bacteria, and it is not contagious. The exact cause of lichen planus is unknown, but it is thought to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. There is no cure for lichen planus, but the lesions can be treated with topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, or oral antihistamines.

Cutaneous graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) is a serious complication of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. It occurs when donor T cells in the transplanted bone marrow attack the recipient's tissues. Cutaneous GVHD can affect any part of the skin, but it is most common on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The lesions of cutaneous GVHD are typically red, scaly, and itchy. In severe cases, they can become ulcerated and infected. There is no cure for cutaneous GVHD, but it can be treated with topical and systemic corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and other immunosuppressive drugs.

Explanation:
The patient presented with a pruritic, reticulated bullous eruption that started on his neck, upper back, and buttocks. He felt well otherwise, denying fever, gastrointestinal upset, or any antecedent illness or exposure. He denied any family history of similar eruptions and was not taking any medications aside from whey protein supplementation. He was eating a normal diet. The cutaneous eruption had continued to spread despite topical and oral corticosteroid therapy, and diphenhydramine provided no relief from the pruritus.

On clinical examination, vesicles and bullae were found coalescing into large reticulated plaques with background erythema on the upper neck, inframammary areas, groin, mid back, and extending down onto the upper buttocks. The bullae were eroded in some areas with hemorrhagic crust.

Punch biopsy specimens from characteristic lesions were obtained and sent for hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) examination. The H&E findings showed abrupt necrosis of the epidermis and an intraepidermal blister filled with neutrophils and eosinophils. The blister correlates with the bulla seen clinically. The upper dermis showed a mixed infiltrate of lymphocytes, eosinophils, and neutrophils.

Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) study was negative for IgG, IgM, IgA, complement, and fibrin in the salt-split skin.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of linear IgA bullous dermatosis. Linear IgA bullous dermatosis is a rare, autoimmune blistering disorder characterized by linear deposition of IgA at the basement membrane zone of the skin. It typically presents in children and young adults, with a female predominance. The most common initial lesions are tense bullae on an erythematous base, which may coalesce to form large blisters. The lesions are typically located on the extremities, trunk, and buttocks. Pruritus is common. The diagnosis is made by biopsy, which shows linear deposition of IgA at the basement membrane zone. Treatment is with systemic corticosteroids, which usually result in rapid resolution of the lesions.

The other possible diagnoses are not consistent with the patient's presentation. Confluent and reticulated papillomatosis is a benign, self-limiting skin condition characterized by confluent, reticulated papules on the trunk and extremities. Bullous prurigo pigmentosa is a rare, chronic, pruritic dermatosis characterized by grouped vesicles and bullae on an erythematous base. Linear IgA bullous dermatosis is a much more likely diagnosis in this patient. Lichen planus pigmentosus is a chronic, autoimmune skin condition characterized by flat-topped, violaceous papules that may become lichenified. It is not typically associated with bullae.

Explanation:
The patient in this case has a diffusely swollen eyelid that was initially diagnosed as a chalazion. However, the lesion continued to grow despite conservative measures, and a biopsy revealed a mixed inflammatory infiltrate without evidence of neoplasia. Intralesional triamcinolone was then administered, which resulted in an initial decrease in lesion size. However, 6 weeks later, the patient developed new-onset ipsilateral extraocular motility deficits and palpable preauricular lymphadenopathy. A magnetic resonance image revealed an infiltrative process in the involved eyelid and lymphadenopathy. A second biopsy of the eyelid lesion revealed large, atypical lymphocytes diffusely positive for CD20 and negative for CD5 and Bcl-1, supporting a diagnosis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

The next step in the management of this patient is to determine Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) status and consider observation following cessation of methotrexate therapy. EBV is a herpesvirus that is associated with the development of DLBCL in a subset of patients. In patients with EBV-positive DLBCL, treatment with rituximab, a monoclonal antibody that targets the CD20 antigen on B cells, has been shown to be effective. However, in patients with EBV-negative DLBCL, treatment with rituximab is not as effective. In these patients, observation following cessation of methotrexate therapy may be an option, as methotrexate has been shown to have some activity against DLBCL.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Option A (initiate treatment with radiation and/or chemotherapy) is incorrect because the patient has a localized lesion of DLBCL, and radiation and chemotherapy are typically reserved for patients with advanced disease.
* Option B (initiate treatment with rituximab) is incorrect because the patient has EBV-negative DLBCL, and rituximab is not as effective in this setting.
* Option C (excise the eyelid lesion) is incorrect because the lesion is not confined to the eyelid, and excision would not provide adequate treatment.

 94%|█████████▍| 1432/1525 [5:26:42<22:37, 14.60s/it]The correct answer is: **D: Anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy.**

The patient has a history of Sturge-Weber syndrome (SWS) and glaucoma. He has previously undergone trabeculectomy in the right eye with mitomycin C 4 years earlier, but his IOP has since risen to 30 mm Hg and is not controlled with medical therapy. He now has a tense fibrous capsule encapsulating the Ahmed glaucoma valve plate, which was excised. Postoperatively, he has hypotony and a shallow anterior chamber, with accompanying choroidal effusion and exudative retinal detachment.

The most likely cause of the choroidal effusion is hypotony. Hypotony can lead to choroidal effusion and retinal detachment by decreasing the hydrostatic pressure within the eye, which in turn decreases the inward force on the retina. This can allow fluid to leak from the choroid into the subretinal space, causing a retinal detachment.

Anti–vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy is a treatment for choroidal neovascularization (CNV), which is a common cause of exudative retinal detachment. VEGF is a protein that promotes the growth of new blood vessels. In CNV, VEGF is produced by abnormal cells in the retina, which leads to the growth of new blood vessels that leak fluid into the subretinal space. Anti–VEGF therapy works by blocking the action of VEGF, which helps to stop the growth of new blood vessels and reduce the leakage of fluid into the subretinal space.

In this case, the patient has a history of SWS, which is a condition that can cause CNV. He also has a choroidal effusion and exudative retinal detachment, which are both signs of CNV. Therefore, it is likely that the patient has CNV, and anti–VEGF therapy would be a reasonable treatment option.

The other options are not as likely to be effective in this case. Drainage of the choroidal effusion would only be a temporary solution, as the effusion would likely recur. Oral steroids can be used to treat CNV, but they are not as effective as anti–VEGF therapy. Oral propranolol is a beta-blocker that is used to treat glaucoma, but it is not effective in treating CNV.

 94%|█████████▍| 1433/1525 [5:26:53<20:52, 13.61s/it]The correct answer is: B. Incontinentia pigmenti

Incontinentia pigmenti (IP) is a rare, X-linked dominant genetic disorder characterized by a characteristic skin rash, abnormal teeth, and eye abnormalities. The rash is usually present at birth or shortly thereafter and is characterized by linear streaks of blisters, papules, and hyperpigmentation. The rash typically resolves over time, but the skin changes may persist into adulthood. IP is caused by mutations in the IKBKG gene, which codes for a protein called inhibitor of kappa B kinase gamma (IKKgamma). IKKgamma is a protein that plays a role in the regulation of inflammation and cell death. Mutations in IKKgamma lead to uncontrolled inflammation and cell death, which cause the characteristic skin rash and other manifestations of IP.

The diagnosis of IP is usually based on the clinical presentation and a skin biopsy. The skin biopsy shows characteristic changes, including a perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate, basal cell degeneration, and melanin incontinence. There is no cure for IP, but treatment is aimed at managing the symptoms. Treatment may include topical steroids, oral antibiotics, and other medications. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to correct the eye abnormalities.

The other options are incorrect because they are not characteristic of IP. Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is the virus that causes chickenpox. Chickenpox is a common childhood illness characterized by a rash of blisters that usually resolves within a week. Herpes simplex virus (HSV) is a virus that can cause a variety of skin infections, including genital herpes and cold sores. Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) is a rare, noncancerous disorder that affects the Langerhans cells, a type of white blood cell.

Explanation:

The patient is a 90-year-old woman with a history of vomiting and abdominal pain once a year that started 10 years earlier. She had always been diagnosed as having adhesive ileus, and her symptoms always improved within a day after hospital admission. However, this time her symptoms are more severe and she has a mass on the right side of the paraumbilical point.

The most likely diagnosis is small-bowel volvulus. Small-bowel volvulus is a twisting of the small intestine that can cause obstruction and ischemia. It is more common in older adults, especially those with a history of abdominal surgery. The symptoms of small-bowel volvulus include abdominal pain, vomiting, and distention. The diagnosis is made with abdominal CT scan.

The treatment for small-bowel volvulus is surgery to untwist the intestine and relieve the obstruction. The prognosis is good if the surgery is performed promptly.

The other possible diagnoses are:

* Intussusception: This is a condition in which one part of the intestine telescopes into another part of the intestine. It is more common in children, but can occur in adults. The symptoms of intussusception include abdominal pain, vomiting, and bloody diarrhea. The diagnosis is made with abdominal CT scan or ultrasound. The treatment is surgery to remove the intussusception.
* Colon cancer: This is a type of cancer that starts in the colon. It is more common in older adults. The symptoms of colon cancer include abdominal pain, change in bowel habits, and blood in the stool. The diagnosis is made with colonoscopy or CT scan. The treatment is surgery to remove the cancer.
* Mesenteric ischemia: This is a condition in which the blood supply to the small intestine is blocked. It is more common in older adults, especially those with heart disease or diabetes. The symptoms of mesenteric ischemia include abdominal pain, vomiting, and distention. The diagnosis is made with abdominal CT scan. The treatment is surgery to restore the blood supply to the small intestine.

Explanation:
The correct answer is D: Right thoracotomy with primary closure and mesh placement.

This is a case of a large incisional hernia. The patient is obese and has a history of multiple medical problems. The hernia is located in the right flank, and it is large enough to contain abdominal contents, including the liver, ascending colon, and omental fat.

The goal of treatment is to reduce the hernia and repair the defect. The patient has already been counseled on weight loss, but she has not lost enough weight to make her a good candidate for laparoscopic surgery. Therefore, the next step is to perform a right thoracotomy to expose the hernia. The hernia sac is then opened, and the abdominal contents are reduced. The defect is then repaired with sutures and a mesh.

The other options are not correct for the following reasons:

* Option A: Video-assisted thoracic surgery reduction is not a good option for this patient because she is obese and has a history of multiple medical problems. Video-assisted thoracic surgery is a minimally invasive procedure that is usually reserved for patients who are good candidates for laparoscopic surgery.
* Option B: Transabdominal laparoscopic reduction and mesh placement is not a good option for this patient because she is obese and has a history of multiple medical problems. Transabdominal laparoscopic reduction is a minimally invasive procedure that is usually reserved for patients who are good candidates for laparoscopic surgery.
* Option C: Video-assisted thoracic surgery reduction with primary closure is not a good option for this patient because the defect is large enough to contain abdominal contents.

Explanation:
The most likely diagnosis in this case is a retroperitoneal abscess. The patient is a woman in her 30s with a history of chronic hepatitis B, which is a risk factor for the development of abscesses. She is also symptomatic with intermittent left upper quadrant abdominal pain that is associated with nausea and constipation, which are common symptoms of abscesses. In addition, her physical examination revealed a soft, nontender, minimally distended abdomen with no palpable masses and no costovertebral angle tenderness, which are all consistent with a retroperitoneal abscess. Laboratory test results at presentation revealed complete blood cell count, comprehensive metabolic panel, and amylase values within the reference ranges, which are all non-specific findings that could be seen with a variety of conditions. However, the hepatitis B virus quantification level of 1590 IU/mL is a significant finding, as it suggests that the patient has active hepatitis B infection. Active hepatitis B infection is a risk factor for the development of abscesses, as it can weaken the immune system and make it more difficult for the body to fight off infection. The computed tomographic scan of the abdomen and pelvis using intravenous contrast revealed a 13-cm retroperitoneal mass on the left side with a significant mass effect. This is a classic finding for a retroperitoneal abscess.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely in this case. Serous cystadenoma of the pancreas is a rare tumor that is typically seen in older women. Endothelial adrenal cyst is a benign cyst that is typically seen in younger women. Pheochromocytoma is a rare tumor that is typically seen in people with a family history of the condition.

The patient has a ring-enhanced lesion with surrounding edema on the left frontoparietal lobe, which is concerning for a brain tumor. The multiple red papules on the tongue, trunk, and limbs are also concerning, as they could be a sign of metastatic disease. It is important to consult a neurosurgeon to evaluate the brain CT finding and to obtain a CT scan of the lung and abdomen to rule out metastatic disease. It is also important to offer genetic counseling for the patient and her family, as some brain tumors are hereditary.

The other answers are incorrect because they do not address the most concerning findings in this case, which are the brain tumor and the possibility of metastatic disease.

* **B. Consult a neurosurgeon to evaluate the brain CT finding; obtain a dermatology consultation and refer the patient to interventional radiology.** This answer is incorrect because it does not address the possibility of metastatic disease. A dermatology consultation may be helpful to rule out a skin condition as the cause of the red papules, but it is not necessary in this case. Interventional radiology may be helpful to treat the brain tumor, but it is not the first step in management.
* **C. Continue intravenous antibiotics only.** This answer is incorrect because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with an infection. The patient has a brain tumor, not an infection. Intravenous antibiotics would not be helpful in this case.
* **D. Obtain a biopsy of the tongue lesions.** This answer is incorrect because the tongue lesions are not the most concerning finding in this case. The brain tumor is the most concerning finding, and a biopsy of the tongue lesions would not provide any information that would change management.

Hepatic encephalopathy is a neurological disorder that can occur in people with liver disease. It is caused by a build-up of ammonia in the blood, which can damage brain cells. Symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy can range from mild confusion to coma.

The patient in this case does not have any symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy. His cognitive capacity and mental status remained stable during the inpatient liver transplant evaluation. He did not have any confusion, insomnia, or decreased mental alertness. His serum ammonia level was also within the normal range.

Therefore, it is unlikely that the patient has hepatic encephalopathy. No treatment is necessary at this time.

The patient has a history of myelofibrosis and has received a stem cell transplant. He is now presenting with a nonpruritic rash on his face, trunk, and extremities. The rash is associated with intermittent fever, muscle pain, and weakness. His liver function tests are mildly abnormal. The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are consistent with a diagnosis of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

GVHD is a common complication of allogeneic stem cell transplantation. It occurs when the donor immune cells attack the recipient's tissues. GVHD can affect any organ system, but it most commonly affects the skin, gastrointestinal tract, liver, and lungs.

The diagnosis of GVHD is made based on the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings. A skin biopsy is often helpful to confirm the diagnosis.

The treatment of GVHD is based on the severity of the disease. Mild GVHD can be treated with topical steroids or calcineurin inhibitors. Severe GVHD requires systemic immunosuppressive therapy.

In this case, the patient's rash is mild and does not appear to be affecting his vital signs or organ function. Therefore, the first step in management is to obtain a skin punch biopsy to confirm the diagnosis of GVHD. If the biopsy confirms GVHD, the patient can be treated with topical steroids or calcineurin inhibitors. If the GVHD is severe, the patient may need to be treated with systemic immunosuppressive therapy.

The other answer choices are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate management for a patient with a suspected diagnosis of GVHD.

A: Order anti-dsDNA, anti-Smith, and antihistone antibody tests. These tests are used to diagnose systemic lupus erythematosus, which is a different autoimmune disease than GVHD.

C: Start high-potency topical steroid, topical calcineurin inhibitor, or both. These medications can be used to treat GVHD, but they are not the first-line treatment for mild GVHD.

D: Start systemic immunosuppressive therapy. This is the treatment for severe GVHD, but it is not necessary for mild GVHD.

The patient has a palpable mass in the left supratrochlear notch, with 4 mm of proptosis and 2 mm of inferior globe dystopia, with increased resistance to retropulsion in the left eye. Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits demonstrated an infiltrating superomedial mass involving the extraconal and intraconal space on the left side. These findings are highly suggestive of a malignancy.

The first step in the management of any orbital mass is to obtain a biopsy to establish a definitive diagnosis. This can be done through an orbitotomy, which is a surgical procedure to access the contents of the orbit. The biopsy specimen can then be examined by a pathologist to determine the type of malignancy.

Once the diagnosis is established, the treatment plan will be individualized based on the specific type of cancer. In general, treatment for orbital malignancies may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or a combination of these modalities.

The goal of treatment is to control the cancer and preserve vision. In some cases, it may be possible to achieve a cure. However, in most cases, the goal of treatment is to control the cancer and improve the patient's quality of life.

Observing the patient without biopsy is not an appropriate management option. This is because the patient has a palpable mass in the left supratrochlear notch, with 4 mm of proptosis and 2 mm of inferior globe dystopia, with increased resistance to retropulsion in the left eye. Magnetic resonance imaging of the orbits demonstrated an infiltrating superomedial mass involving the extraconal and intraconal space on the left side. These findings are highly suggestive of a malignancy. A biopsy is necessary to establish a definitive diagnosis and to guide treatment.

Administering empirical corticosteroid treatment is not an appropriate management option. This is because corticosteroids can mask the signs and symptoms of malignancy. A biopsy is necessary to establish a definitive diagnosis and to guide treatment.

Performing external beam radiotherapy without biopsy is not an appropriate management option. This is because radiotherapy can damage healthy tissue. A biopsy is necessary to establish a definitive diagnosis and to guide treatment.

Explanation:
The most likely diagnosis in this case is multiple evanescent white dot syndrome (MEWDS). MEWDS is a self-limiting retinal disorder characterized by the sudden onset of multiple, small, white lesions in the retina. The lesions are typically located in the posterior pole and are often associated with shimmering lights and blurry vision. The diagnosis of MEWDS is made clinically, based on the patient's history and the appearance of the lesions on fundus examination. There is no specific treatment for MEWDS, but most patients experience spontaneous resolution of their symptoms within a few months. In some cases, oral corticosteroids may be used to speed up the resolution of the lesions. However, oral corticosteroids are not always necessary and can have side effects, so they should only be used if the patient's symptoms are severe. Topical corticosteroids are not effective in treating MEWDS. Intravitreal antibiotics are not indicated in the treatment of MEWDS, as the condition is not caused by an infection.

Explanation:

Splenic lymphangiomatosis is a rare, benign condition characterized by the proliferation of lymphatic vessels within the spleen. It is most commonly seen in young women, and typically presents with massive splenomegaly, abdominal pain, and fatigue. The diagnosis is made on imaging studies, such as CT scan or MRI, which show characteristic features of the condition, such as multiple, small, cystic lesions within the spleen. Treatment is usually not necessary, as the condition is usually self-limiting. However, in some cases, splenectomy may be necessary to relieve symptoms or to prevent complications, such as rupture of the spleen.

The other options are incorrect because they are not consistent with the patient's history and presentation. Splenic pelosis is a condition characterized by the presence of hair follicles within the spleen. It is a rare condition that is usually asymptomatic. Echinococcal splenic cystic disease is a parasitic infection of the spleen. It is most common in areas with high rates of echinococcosis, such as the Mediterranean region, Asia, and South America. The patient's history and presentation do not suggest that she has this condition. Non-Hodgkins lymphoma is a type of cancer that can affect the spleen.

The left pericardiacophrenic vein is a small vein that drains the left lung and pericardium. It is a tributary of the left internal thoracic vein. The left internal thoracic vein is a large vein that runs along the left side of the chest. It is a tributary of the left brachiocephalic vein. The left anomalous pulmonary vein is a rare condition in which one of the pulmonary veins drains into the left superior vena cava instead of the left atrium. The left superior intercostal vein is a small vein that runs along the left side of the chest. It is a tributary of the left brachiocephalic vein.

In this case, the patient had a triple-lumen central catheter placed in the left internal jugular vein under ultrasonographic guidance. The catheter went in easily without resistance, was drop tested to confirm venous placement, and flushed and drew easily, and venous waveforms and pressures were transduced. However, on postprocedure radiography, the tip of the triple-lumen catheter was not in the expected location. The most likely explanation for this is that the catheter had catheterized the left pericardiacophrenic vein instead of the left internal thoracic vein. This is because the left pericardiacophrenic vein is a small vein that is located close to the left internal jugular vein. It is also a tributary of the left internal thoracic vein, which is the vein that the catheter was intended to catheterize.

The other possible explanations for the abnormal location of the catheter are less likely. The left anomalous pulmonary vein is a rare condition, and it is unlikely that the patient would have this condition. The left superior intercostal vein is a small vein that is located close to the left internal thoracic vein. However, it is not a tributary of the left internal thoracic vein, so it is less likely that the catheter would have catheterized this vein.

In conclusion, the most likely explanation for the abnormal location of the catheter is that it had catheterized the left pericardiacophrenic vein instead of the left internal thoracic vein.

The patient has a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, which is a known risk factor for erythema multiforme. She also has positive serologic testing for herpes simplex virus (HSV) 1 and 2, which is the most common cause of erythema multiforme. The patient's lesions improved with prednisone, which is a corticosteroid that is used to treat erythema multiforme. The patient's lesions recurred when treatment was discontinued, which is a common finding in erythema multiforme. The patient also reports concurrent painful oral lesions, which are a common finding in erythema multiforme.

The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are all consistent with a diagnosis of erythema multiforme. The most appropriate treatment for erythema multiforme is oral prednisone and HSV viral suppression therapy. Oral prednisone is a corticosteroid that helps to reduce inflammation and swelling. HSV viral suppression therapy helps to prevent recurrence of the lesions.

The other options are incorrect because they are not the most appropriate treatment for erythema multiforme. Serum cryoglobulin level is a test that is used to diagnose cryoglobulinemia, which is a condition that can cause erythema multiforme. Administering intradermal progesterone challenge is a test that is used to diagnose autoimmune progesterone dermatitis, which is a condition that can cause erythema multiforme. Prescribing interferon, ribavirin, and telaprevir is a treatment for hepatitis C virus infection. However, these medications are not the most appropriate treatment for erythema multiforme.

 95%|█████████▍| 1446/1525 [5:29:29<16:02, 12.19s/it]The correct answer is: D. Obtain a biopsy of the lesion for pathological examination.

Erosive plaques on the scrotum can be caused by a variety of conditions, including infection, inflammation, and cancer. In order to determine the cause of the lesion, it is necessary to obtain a biopsy and perform pathological examination.

A topical steroid is not an appropriate treatment for an erosive plaque on the scrotum, as it could worsen the condition. Valacyclovir is an antiviral medication that is used to treat herpes simplex virus infections. However, herpes simplex virus is not the most likely cause of an erosive plaque on the scrotum in a 61-year-old man. Order laboratory studies to rule out syphilis is not an appropriate treatment for an erosive plaque on the scrotum. Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection that is usually treated with antibiotics.

Therefore, the most appropriate course of action is to obtain a biopsy of the lesion for pathological examination. This will allow the physician to determine the cause of the lesion and recommend the appropriate treatment.

The aldosterone-renin ratio (ARR) is a test used to screen for primary aldosteronism. It is calculated by dividing the plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) by the plasma renin activity (PRA). In primary aldosteronism, the PAC is high and the PRA is low.

In this case, the patient's PAC is 30 ng/dL and the PRA is 0.5 ng/mL/h. The ARR is 60. This is a high ARR, which suggests that the patient may have primary aldosteronism. However, there are several factors that can affect the ARR, including medications. Lisinopril is a medication that is used to treat high blood pressure. It can lower the PRA, which can artificially lower the ARR. Therefore, the ARR in this patient is unreliable because he is taking lisinopril. The ARR should be measured again 1 month after discontinuing lisinopril to get a more accurate result.

Answer A is incorrect because the patient's ARR is not high enough to confirm primary aldosteronism. Answer B is incorrect because an aldosterone suppression test is not necessary to confirm primary aldosteronism when the ARR is high. Answer C is incorrect because the patient's ARR is high, which suggests that he may have primary aldosteronism. However, the ARR is unreliable because he is taking lisinopril. The ARR should be measured again 1 month after discontinuing lisinopril to get a more accurate result.

 95%|█████████▍| 1448/1525 [5:29:56<16:20, 12.73s/it]Answer: C. Repeat lumbar puncture.

Explanation:
The patient has a history of a severe headache, transient blurred vision, and neurological decline. She has also had a brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) that shows numerous foci of enhancement throughout the brain. These findings are concerning for multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is an autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system (CNS). In MS, the immune system attacks the myelin sheath that surrounds nerve fibers. This damage can cause a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, numbness, tingling, weakness, and vision problems.

The patient's MRI findings are consistent with MS. However, other conditions can also cause these findings. To confirm the diagnosis of MS, it is necessary to perform a lumbar puncture. A lumbar puncture is a procedure in which a needle is inserted into the spinal canal to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The CSF is then tested for the presence of antibodies to myelin basic protein (MBP), a protein that is found in the myelin sheath. The presence of these antibodies is highly suggestive of MS.

The other options are not as likely to be helpful in this case. A screen for autoantibodies may be useful if the patient has other symptoms that suggest an autoimmune disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. However, in this case, the patient's only symptoms are related to MS. Fluorescein angiography is a test that can be used to diagnose retinal diseases, such as macular degeneration. However, the patient's visual acuity is normal, so this test is not necessary. Carotid ultrasonography is a test that can be used to diagnose carotid artery disease. However, the patient's history and physical examination do not suggest that she has carotid artery disease. Therefore, the most appropriate next step is to repeat the lumbar puncture.

The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with cat-scratch disease, which is caused by the bacterium Bartonella henselae. The most common ocular manifestation of cat-scratch disease is anterior uveitis, but retinal lesions can also occur. Serum titers of IgM and IgG for Bartonella henselae are the most sensitive and specific tests for the diagnosis of cat-scratch disease. If the patient is found to have positive serology, then treatment with antibiotics is recommended.

A is incorrect because the patient's symptoms are concerning for a serious condition, and observation alone is not appropriate. B is incorrect because steroids are not indicated for the treatment of cat-scratch disease. C is incorrect because magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is not necessary to diagnose cat-scratch disease.

 95%|█████████▌| 1450/1525 [5:30:24<16:37, 13.30s/it]Answer: C. Idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome

Explanation:
The patient is a young boy with a history of recurrent right orbital swelling and proptosis. The symptoms are not associated with any systemic illness, and there is no evidence of infection or malignancy. The physical examination findings are consistent with an inflammatory process involving the orbit. The imaging studies show inflammation of the orbital fat and perineural soft tissues. The most likely diagnosis is idiopathic orbital inflammatory syndrome (IOIS).

IOIS is a rare, idiopathic inflammatory condition of the orbit. It is characterized by orbital pain, swelling, and proptosis. The condition is often bilateral, but it can also be unilateral. The symptoms are usually self-limited, but they can last for months or even years. There is no specific treatment for IOIS, but corticosteroids can be used to reduce inflammation.

The other possible diagnoses are orbital cellulitis, rhabdomyosarcoma of the extraocular muscles, and thyroid ophthalmopathy. Orbital cellulitis is an infection of the soft tissues of the orbit. It is usually caused by bacteria, and it is often associated with sinusitis or dental infection. Rhabdomyosarcoma of the extraocular muscles is a rare, malignant tumor of the muscles of the eye. It is most common in children. Thyroid ophthalmopathy is an autoimmune disorder that affects the muscles and tissues around the eye. It is associated with Graves' disease, a condition that causes hyperthyroidism.

In this case, the patient's history and physical examination findings are most consistent with IOIS. The imaging studies show inflammation of the orbital fat and perineural soft tissues, which is also consistent with IOIS. Orbital cellulitis would be more likely if the patient had a history of sinusitis or dental infection. Rhabdomyosarcoma of the extraocular muscles would be more likely if the patient was a child. Thyroid ophthalmopathy would be more likely if the patient had a history of hyperthyroidism.

 95%|█████████▌| 1451/1525 [5:30:40<17:39, 14.32s/it]The correct answer is: B. Ileal intussusception.

Explanation:

An ileal intussusception is a condition in which part of the small intestine telescopes into another part of the small intestine. This can cause obstruction of the bowel and can lead to serious complications if not treated promptly.

The patient in this case presents with a history of lower abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting that has been going on for a few weeks. She also has a palpable mass in the lower right abdominal quadrant. These symptoms are consistent with ileal intussusception.

The results of the abdominal ultrasonographic examination and abdominal computed tomography are suggestive of an ileal intussusception. The colonoscopy revealed the presence of a bulge in the cecal lumen, which is further evidence of an ileal intussusception.

Appendiceal abscess, cecal volvulus, and appendicular intussusception are all possible diagnoses in this case. However, the clinical presentation, laboratory findings, and imaging studies are most consistent with ileal intussusception.

 95%|█████████▌| 1452/1525 [5:30:52<16:27, 13.53s/it]The answer is **C: Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor**.

The patient's history of prostatic carcinoma and renal cell carcinoma, as well as the presence of a new pelvic mass on surveillance imaging, raises the concern for a recurrent malignant neoplasm. However, the patient's prostate-specific antigen level is undetectable, which is unusual for recurrent prostatic carcinoma. Additionally, the magnetic resonance imaging findings of a heterogeneously enhancing mass with central necrosis are more suggestive of a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor than a recurrent prostatic carcinoma.

Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) are rare, aggressive neoplasms that arise from the Schwann cells that myelinate peripheral nerves. They are typically seen in patients in the fifth or sixth decade of life, and there is a slight male predominance. The most common presenting symptom is pain, followed by weakness and sensory loss in the distribution of the affected nerve. MPNSTs can metastasize to the lungs, bones, and liver.

The diagnosis of MPNST is made by biopsy. The tumor cells are typically spindle-shaped and have a high mitotic index. Immunohistochemical staining is positive for S100 and CD34.

The treatment of MPNST is surgery followed by radiation therapy. Chemotherapy may also be used in some cases. The prognosis for MPNST is poor, with a median survival of 2-3 years.

The other possible diagnoses are all less likely given the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging findings. A neurofibroma is a benign tumor that arises from Schwann cells. It is typically seen in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1. Neurofibromas are usually non-painful and do not metastasize.

A pseudosarcomatous fibromyxoid tumor is a rare, soft tissue tumor that typically occurs in the extremities. It is often misdiagnosed as a sarcoma. Pseudosarcomatous fibromyxoid tumors are usually benign, but they can rarely be malignant.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is MPNST.

Explanation:
The most likely diagnosis is malignant sarcoma. The patient is a man in his 60s, which is the age group at highest risk for sarcoma. The mass is large (10 × 15 cm) and rapidly growing, which are also features of sarcoma. The mass is associated with pain, which is a common symptom of sarcoma. The mass is located in the right flank, which is a common location for sarcoma. The mass appears to directly invade the liver, which is a sign of malignancy. The CT scan shows multiple small areas of calcification, which can be seen in sarcoma. The core needle biopsy showed inconclusive results, which is not uncommon in sarcoma. The patient was then taken to the operating room where an excisional biopsy was performed, which is the gold standard for diagnosing sarcoma. The final diagnosis was malignant sarcoma.

Bacterial abscess is less likely because the patient does not have any fever or other signs of infection. The mass is not tender to touch, which is not a typical finding for bacterial abscess. The CT scan does not show any evidence of infection, such as pus or fluid collection.

Fungal mycetoma is less likely because the patient does not have any travel history to an area where mycetoma is endemic. The mass is not associated with any skin lesions, which are a common finding in mycetoma. The CT scan does not show any evidence of fungal infection, such as granulomas or calcification.

Giant infiltrating lipoma is less likely because the patient has a rapidly growing mass that is associated with pain. Giant infiltrating lipomas are typically slow-growing and painless. The CT scan shows that the mass is infiltrating the liver, which is not a typical finding for giant infiltrating lipoma.

Explanation:

The patient's hepatitis C antibody (anti-HCV) result was positive, which indicates that she has been infected with the hepatitis C virus. However, her aminotransferase levels are not elevated, which suggests that she does not have significant liver damage. The most common strain of HCV in the United States is genotype 1, which has lower response rates to interferon-based therapy. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the patient's test results is that she is infected with genotype 1 HCV and does not have significant liver damage.

The other possible answers are incorrect because:

* Answer A is incorrect because the patient's viral load is not known.
* Answer B is incorrect because the patient's antibody to HCV indicates that she is still infected with the virus.
* Answer C is incorrect because the patient's aminotransferase levels are not elevated, which suggests that she does not have significant liver damage.

A bronchoscopy is a procedure that allows a doctor to look inside the lungs through a thin tube. A bronchoscopy can be used to take tissue samples, remove foreign objects, or deliver medication. In this case, a bronchoscopy would be used to obtain bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, which is a sample of fluid from the lungs. This fluid can be tested for bacteria, viruses, and other organisms that may be causing the lung infection.

A computed tomography (CT) scan is a type of X-ray that can provide more detailed images of the lungs than a regular X-ray. However, a CT scan is not necessary to diagnose a lung infection. In most cases, a bronchoscopy will provide enough information to make a diagnosis.

An infectious workup is a series of tests that are used to identify the cause of an infection. These tests may include a complete blood count, blood culture, sputum culture, and purified protein derivative test. However, these tests are not necessary to diagnose a lung infection in a patient who is already being treated with antibiotics.

Treating with oral antibiotics is not the best option in this case because the patient has already been treated with analgesia and physiotherapy without improvement. This suggests that the infection is not caused by a virus, which would be the most likely cause of a viral pneumonia that responds to treatment with oral antibiotics. A more likely cause is a bacterial infection, which would require treatment with intravenous antibiotics.

Therefore, the best course of action is to perform a bronchoscopy and obtain bronchoalveolar lavage fluid for culture and sensitivity. This will allow the doctor to identify the cause of the infection and prescribe the appropriate treatment.

Explanation:
The most likely diagnosis in this case is necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum (NLD), a chronic skin condition that is associated with diabetes mellitus. NLD typically presents as a well-defined, scaly, reddish-brown patch with central yellow deposits. The lesions are often tender and may ulcerate.

The diagnosis of NLD is made by biopsy. A punch biopsy is a procedure in which a small piece of tissue is removed from the lesion for examination under a microscope. A punch biopsy is the most accurate way to diagnose NLD and to rule out other possible causes of the lesion.

The treatment of NLD is aimed at controlling the underlying diabetes mellitus and relieving the symptoms of the lesion. Treatment may include topical steroids, oral steroids, and laser therapy.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. A radiograph of the lower leg would not be helpful in diagnosing NLD. Antinuclear antibody levels are not specific for NLD and would not be helpful in making the diagnosis. Blood cultures and empirical antibiotics are not indicated in the absence of systemic symptoms.

The patient has a 23-year history of polycythemia vera, which is a myeloproliferative neoplasm characterized by an increase in red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Polycythemia vera is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic events, such as stroke and myocardial infarction. The patient in this case has a history of left upper quadrant pain, which is a common symptom of splenic infarction. Splenic infarction is a complication of polycythemia vera that can occur when the spleen becomes enlarged and congested. Splenic infarction can be life-threatening, and therefore, it is important to treat it promptly.

The most definitive treatment for splenic infarction is splenectomy. Splenectomy is the surgical removal of the spleen. Splenectomy is effective in treating splenic infarction and can prevent further complications. The patient in this case should be referred to a surgeon for a consultation about splenectomy.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Option A, manage conservatively with transfusions, fluids, and analgesics, is not appropriate because the patient has a life-threatening condition that requires definitive treatment. Option B, obtain a bone marrow biopsy, is not appropriate because the patient's bone marrow is already known to be abnormal due to polycythemia vera. Option C, obtain an urgent upper endoscopy, is not appropriate because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a gastrointestinal bleed.

The patient has a neurotrophic corneal ulcer, which is a type of corneal ulcer that occurs in patients with decreased corneal sensation. This can be due to a number of conditions, including diabetes mellitus, rheumatoid arthritis, and herpes zoster. Neurotrophic corneal ulcers are at high risk for perforation and vision loss, and therefore require prompt treatment.

The first-line treatment for neurotrophic corneal ulcers is topical steroids. However, in this case, the patient's corneal ulcer is large and deep, and there is evidence of anterior uveitis. This suggests that the patient may have a severe immune-mediated condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis. In such cases, systemic steroids are often necessary to control the inflammation and prevent further corneal damage.

Bandage contact lenses can be used to protect the cornea and promote healing. However, they are not a substitute for systemic steroids in patients with severe neurotrophic corneal ulcers.

Tarsorrhaphy is a surgical procedure that involves sewing the eyelids together to reduce corneal exposure. This can be helpful in patients who are unable to tolerate contact lenses or who have severe corneal inflammation. However, it is not a first-line treatment for neurotrophic corneal ulcers.

Autologous serum tears are a type of eye drops that are made from the patient's own blood. They can be helpful in patients with dry eyes, but they are not effective for treating neurotrophic corneal ulcers.

In conclusion, the correct answer is A. Prescribe oral prednisone. This is the most effective treatment for a neurotrophic corneal ulcer in a patient with a severe immune-mediated condition.

The patient has a moving black spot in his visual field, which is a sign of a cyst in the eye. The cyst is oval in shape, measures 2 mm in thickness by 2 mm in diameter, is translucent and brown, and changes its location with head posture. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of a choroidal cyst.

Choroidal cysts are benign lesions that are usually asymptomatic. However, they can sometimes cause visual symptoms, such as floaters, flashing lights, and blurred vision. If a choroidal cyst is causing visual symptoms, it may need to be removed surgically.

Surgical removal of a choroidal cyst is a relatively safe and effective procedure. The cyst is usually removed through a small incision in the sclera (the white of the eye). The cyst is then drained and the incision is sutured closed.

After surgery, the patient will need to wear a patch over the eye for a few days. They may also need to take eye drops to prevent infection. The majority of patients who have a choroidal cyst removed surgically experience complete resolution of their visual symptoms.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. A computerized tomographic scan (CT scan) is a type of imaging test that uses X-rays to create detailed images of the inside of the body. A CT scan would not be helpful in diagnosing a choroidal cyst, as the cyst is located in the eye, which is not visible on a CT scan.

Anterior segment tomography with Pentacam is a type of imaging test that uses a special camera to create detailed images of the front of the eye. This test can be used to diagnose and monitor a variety of eye conditions, including glaucoma. However, it would not be helpful in diagnosing a choroidal cyst, as the cyst is located in the back of the eye, which is not visible on an anterior segment tomography with Pentacam.

Beginning systemic treatment with albendazole is a treatment option for parasitic infections. However, there is no evidence that albendazole is effective in treating choroidal cysts. In fact, albendazole can be toxic to the eyes, so it is not a safe treatment option for this condition.

Therefore, the correct answer is: **D. Surgical removal of the cyst and pathological analysis.**

Explanation:

The most likely diagnosis in this case is tinea corporis, a fungal infection of the skin. The patient presents with a rash that is asymptomatic, has no pain or pruritus, and is located on the trunk, buttocks, and thighs bilaterally. These are all common features of tinea corporis. The patient also has a history of Crohn disease, which is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract. Patients with Crohn disease are at increased risk for developing fungal infections, such as tinea corporis.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely. Fixed drug eruption is a type of allergic reaction to a medication. The rash is typically localized to the area of the skin that came into contact with the medication. Tinea corporis is not caused by a medication.

Lyme disease is an infection caused by a tick bite. The rash associated with Lyme disease is typically a single, large, erythema migrans rash that appears at the site of the tick bite. The rash is often described as "bull's-eye" in appearance. The patient in this case does not have a single, large rash. She has multiple, smaller, annular patches.

Granuloma annulare is a chronic skin condition that is characterized by raised, red or pink rings on the skin. The rings are often found on the hands, feet, and lower legs. The patient in this case does not have the typical appearance of granuloma annulare. Her rash is located on the trunk, buttocks, and thighs.

Explanation:

GIST is a rare type of cancer that starts in the cells that support the lining of the digestive system. It is the most common type of mesenchymal tumor of the gastrointestinal tract. GISTs can occur anywhere in the digestive system, but they are most common in the stomach and small intestine.

GISTs are usually slow-growing tumors, but they can grow and spread to other parts of the body. The symptoms of GIST vary depending on the size and location of the tumor. Some people with GIST may have no symptoms at all, while others may have abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or weight loss.

The diagnosis of GIST is made with a biopsy, which is a procedure to remove a small piece of tissue from the tumor. The tissue is then examined under a microscope by a pathologist to determine if it is cancerous.

The treatment of GIST depends on the size and location of the tumor, the patient's age and health, and the stage of the cancer. Treatment options may include surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy.

In the case presented, the patient is a 28-year-old man with a several months history of constant, burning upper abdominal pain centered on the epigastrium. The pain is associated with morning nausea and is worsened by food and alcohol. He was given trials of proton pump inhibitors and dicyclomine with no relief. He has no prior chronic medical conditions. His family history is positive for a brother with kidney stones. He was a former smoker but denied current drug or alcohol use. Review of systems was positive for dry throat, gastroesophageal reflux, and frequent headaches. Physical examination was notable for a faintly palpable midabdominal mass slightly to the left and above the umbilicus with localized discomfort to palpation. Ultrasonography of the abdomen showed a hypoechoic, hypervascular, solid mass left of the midline. A subsequent computed tomography scan of the abdomen and pelvis demonstrated a left adrenal myelolipoma and a 4.4 × 3.7-cm hypervascular soft tissue mass just left of the midline within the mesentery in close approximation with the small bowel, centered at the level of the L3-L4 intervertebral disc. A laparotomy was performed and a round, well-circumscribed soft tissue mass located approximately 90 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz at the base of the mesentery was removed intact without the need for bowel resection. Pathologic photomicrograph of the specimen showed a spindle cell tumor with a storiform growth pattern and positive staining for c-kit.

The clinical presentation, imaging findings, and pathologic features are consistent with a diagnosis of GIST. Carcinoid tumors are typically small, well-circumscribed tumors that are located in the gastrointestinal tract, particularly the small intestine. They are often associated with carcinoid syndrome, which is a constellation of symptoms that can include flushing, diarrhea, wheezing, and heart problems. Desmoid tumors are rare, slow-growing tumors that are made up of fibroblasts, which are cells that produce collagen. They can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the abdomen. Angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia is a non-cancerous condition that is characterized by the enlargement of lymph nodes. It is often associated with chronic infections, such as HIV infection.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis in this case is GIST.

The patient is a 33-year-old woman who presented to the emergency department as a restrained driver in a motor vehicle collision with air bag deployment. She had diffuse lower abdominal pain with nausea and one episode of emesis. Her vital signs were notable for a blood pressure of 108/69 mm Hg and a heart rate of 124 beats/min. Physical examination findings revealed tachycardia and a distended, diffusely tender abdomen without evidence of a seatbelt sign or peritonitis. Her laboratory findings were unremarkable except for a hemoglobin level of 10.5 g/dL and a white blood cell count of 21 300/μL. Her medical history was significant only for asthma.

Computed tomography revealed a large amount of free fluid throughout the abdomen and pelvis with an area of focal density consistent with a hematoma in the left midabdomen that measured 7.3 × 6.1 × 7.5 cm. There was also an area of free fluid in the right lower quadrant with irregularity of the right gonadal vein and a heterogeneous and bulky uterus.

The most likely diagnosis is a right gonadal vein injury. This is supported by the patient's history of a motor vehicle collision with air bag deployment, her abdominal pain and tenderness, the finding of free fluid in the abdomen and pelvis on computed tomography, and the irregularity of the right gonadal vein on computed tomography.

A duodenal injury is less likely because the patient does not have any symptoms or signs of a duodenal injury, such as upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, or gastrointestinal bleeding.

A mesenteric hematoma is also less likely because the patient does not have any symptoms or signs of a mesenteric hematoma, such as abdominal pain, tenderness, or rebound tenderness.

An avulsed uterine fibroid is also less likely because the patient does not have any symptoms or signs of an avulsed uterine fibroid, such as abnormal vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, or tenderness.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is a right gonadal vein injury.

Her laboratory findings are significant for a lactate level of 18 mg/dL, a white blood cell count of 6000/μL, and a hemoglobin level of 13.3 g/dL. Her computed tomography (CT) scan shows a thickened ileocecal valve with a dilated proximal small bowel and a collapsed distal small bowel. These findings are consistent with ileocolic intussusception.

Ileocolic intussusception is a common cause of small-bowel obstruction in children. It is less common in adults, but it can occur in patients with underlying conditions such as juvenile polyposis syndrome. The diagnosis is made on clinical grounds and confirmed with CT scan. Treatment is surgical reduction of the intussusception.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Colorectal carcinoid tumor is a rare tumor that can occur in the colon or rectum. It is not a common cause of small-bowel obstruction.
* Ileocolic intussusception is a mechanical obstruction of the small bowel. Metastatic carcinomatosis is a metastatic spread of cancer to the small bowel. It is not a mechanical obstruction.
* Cecal volvulus is a twisting of the cecum, which is the right-sided colon. It is a mechanical obstruction of the small bowel.

Explanation:
The patient in this case has severe lactic acidosis, which is a life-threatening condition. The first priority is to stabilize the patient's condition and prevent further deterioration. This can be done by providing supportive care, such as intravenous fluids and oxygen therapy. The patient should also be monitored closely for signs of cardiac arrhythmias, which can be a complication of lactic acidosis.

Imaging of the left leg is not necessary at this time, as the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a local infection or injury. Intravenous antibiotics are not indicated, as the patient does not have an infection. An extended drug screen is not necessary, as there is no evidence that the patient has taken any drugs that could have caused his lactic acidosis.

Therefore, the best course of action is to order observation and cardiac monitoring. This will allow the patient's condition to be closely monitored and any complications can be treated promptly.

Answer: D.
Explanation:

The patient has symptomatic anemia and needs 2 units of packed red blood cells transfused. The patient's hemoglobin is 7.1 g/dL, which is below the normal range of 14-18 g/dL. This indicates that the patient has a low red blood cell count, which can cause symptoms such as fatigue, shortness of breath, and lightheadedness. A pulmonary embolus is a blockage in a pulmonary artery that can cause shortness of breath, chest pain, and coughing up blood. A computed tomography angiography (CTA) of the chest is a test that can be used to diagnose a pulmonary embolus. However, the patient does not have any of the classic symptoms of a pulmonary embolus, and the CTA of the chest is normal. Congestive heart failure is a condition in which the heart cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. This can cause symptoms such as shortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling in the legs, feet, and ankles. A pulmonary artery catheter is a device that can be inserted into a vein in the leg and threaded up to the pulmonary artery. It can be used to measure the pressure in the pulmonary artery and the right ventricle of the heart. However, the patient does not have any of the classic symptoms of congestive heart failure, and the pulmonary artery catheter is not necessary in this case. The patient's blood pressure is 126/59 mm Hg, which is within the normal range. Therefore, the patient does not need a loop diuretic.

Excisional biopsy is the most appropriate management for a patient with a suspicious eye mass. This is because it allows for the definitive diagnosis of the mass and the removal of any malignant cells. Topical interferon drops may be used in conjunction with excisional biopsy to help prevent the recurrence of the mass. However, they are not a substitute for excisional biopsy. Enucleation is the removal of the entire eye. It is only indicated in cases where the mass is malignant and has spread to other parts of the eye. In this case, the patient has a suspicious eye mass that is progressively enlarging. The mass is also red and painful, and the patient can no longer close his eye. These are all signs that the mass may be malignant. Therefore, the most appropriate management is to perform an excisional biopsy to obtain a definitive diagnosis and to remove any malignant cells. Topical interferon drops may be used in conjunction with excisional biopsy to help prevent the recurrence of the mass. However, enucleation is not indicated in this case.

Explanation: The most likely cause of a white pupil in a child is a retinoblastoma, a malignant tumor of the retina. Retinoblastoma is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in children, and it is important to diagnose it early so that it can be treated effectively. The gold standard for diagnosing retinoblastoma is a funduscopic examination, which is an examination of the inside of the eye using an ophthalmoscope. A funduscopic examination can be performed under anesthesia in young children who are unable to cooperate with a regular eye exam.

The other options are not as appropriate in this case. Option B, reassuring the parents and following up in 3 months, is not appropriate because a white pupil could be a sign of a serious eye problem. Option C, obtaining serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for Toxocara canis, is not appropriate because Toxocara canis is a parasite that can cause eye problems in children, but it is not the most common cause of a white pupil. Option D, starting urgent anti-inflammatory or steroid therapy for uveitis, is not appropriate because uveitis is an inflammation of the uvea, which is the middle layer of the eye. Uveitis is not the most common cause of a white pupil, and it is not the best way to treat retinoblastoma.

The patient has sarcoidosis, a chronic inflammatory disease that can affect multiple organs, including the eyes. The patient has already been treated with prednisone, a corticosteroid, which is the first-line treatment for sarcoidosis. However, the patient's vision has continued to deteriorate despite treatment. This suggests that the patient's sarcoidosis is steroid-resistant.

Steroid-resistant sarcoidosis is a serious condition that can lead to permanent vision loss. The patient should be urgently referred to an immunologist, who can discuss other treatment options, such as immunomodulatory agents or biologics.

Answer A is incorrect because increasing the dose of prednisone is unlikely to be effective in a patient with steroid-resistant sarcoidosis. Answer B is incorrect because adding an immunomodulatory agent is not the first-line treatment for steroid-resistant sarcoidosis. Answer C is incorrect because further laboratory and imaging studies are not likely to change the management of the patient's sarcoidosis.

Explanation:

The most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is to perform a shave biopsy of the lesion to confirm the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma. This is because the lesion is a verrucous plaque with underlying fullness, which are characteristic features of squamous cell carcinoma. Additionally, the lesion has been present for several years and has continued to enlarge and thicken, which are also concerning features. A shave biopsy is a minimally invasive procedure that can be performed in the office setting. It involves removing a small sample of tissue from the lesion for pathological examination. If the biopsy results are positive for squamous cell carcinoma, the patient will need to undergo further treatment, such as excision or radiation therapy.

The other options are not as appropriate for the management of this patient. Ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would not be helpful in diagnosing squamous cell carcinoma. These imaging tests can be used to assess the extent of the lesion, but they cannot provide a definitive diagnosis. Immediate excision would be too aggressive at this stage, as the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma is not yet confirmed. No treatment or diagnostic tests are not necessary at this time, as the lesion is suspicious for squamous cell carcinoma and should be further evaluated.

 96%|█████████▋| 1470/1525 [5:34:50<11:34, 12.63s/it]Answer: C. Iatrogenic pancreas transplant thrombosis

Explanation:
The patient has a history of simultaneous pancreas-kidney transplantation 15 years ago and both grafts had been functioning well. Two days prior to presentation, he had a peripheral angiogram done to evaluate a nonhealing left foot ulcer by an interventional cardiologist, at which time a stent graft was deployed to the right common iliac artery for a pseudoaneurysm that was incidentally discovered. Two days after presentation, a computed tomographic scan of the abdomen and pelvis was obtained (Figure). It showed an air-containing abscess and a stent in the common iliac artery. A stent can be seen in the right common iliac artery (A and C, arrowheads). A gas-containing phlegmon was also evident (B and C, asterisks).

The most likely diagnosis is iatrogenic pancreas transplant thrombosis. This is a complication of stent graft placement, which can occur when the stent graft is not properly positioned or when there is a thrombus formation at the site of the stent graft. The symptoms of iatrogenic pancreas transplant thrombosis include fever, abdominal pain, and nausea. The diagnosis is made with a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis, which shows an air-containing abscess and a stent in the common iliac artery.

The treatment of iatrogenic pancreas transplant thrombosis is anticoagulation with heparin or warfarin. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the stent graft and to repair the blood vessel. The prognosis for iatrogenic pancreas transplant thrombosis is good with early diagnosis and treatment.

The other possible diagnoses are not as likely in this case. Ruptured acute appendicitis is a common cause of abdominal pain and fever, but it is unlikely in this case because the patient does not have a history of appendicitis and the CT scan does not show any evidence of appendicitis. Cecal inflammation with abscess is another possible diagnosis, but it is less likely than iatrogenic pancreas transplant thrombosis because the patient does not have a history of cecal inflammation and the CT scan does not show any evidence of cecal inflammation. Hematoma is also a possible diagnosis, but it is less likely than iatrogenic pancreas transplant thrombosis because the patient does not have a history of trauma and the CT scan does not show any evidence of bleeding.

 96%|█████████▋| 1471/1525 [5:34:58<10:06, 11.23s/it]The answer is A: Acute appendicitis.

Acute appendicitis is the most common cause of abdominal pain in the right lower quadrant of adults. It is a condition in which the appendix, a small, finger-shaped organ that projects from the colon, becomes inflamed. The inflammation can cause pain, fever, and nausea. In some cases, the appendix may rupture, which can lead to peritonitis, a serious infection of the lining of the abdomen.

The symptoms of acute appendicitis can vary from person to person. However, the most common symptom is pain in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. The pain may be described as sharp, stabbing, or aching. It may also be accompanied by fever, nausea, and vomiting. In some cases, the pain may radiate to the back or shoulder.

The diagnosis of acute appendicitis is usually made based on the patient's history and physical examination. Imaging tests, such as CT scan or ultrasound, may be used to confirm the diagnosis.

The treatment for acute appendicitis is surgery to remove the appendix. This procedure is called an appendectomy. Appendectomy is usually performed laparoscopically, which is a minimally invasive procedure.

The prognosis for acute appendicitis is good. Most people who have an appendectomy make a full recovery. However, if the appendix ruptures, the infection can spread to the abdominal cavity, which can be life-threatening.

Acute appendicitis is a common condition that can cause significant pain and discomfort. However, it is usually a treatable condition with a good prognosis.

The following are some of the reasons why acute appendicitis is the most likely diagnosis in this case:

* The patient's symptoms are consistent with acute appendicitis. She is experiencing right lower quadrant pain, fever, nausea, and vomiting.
* The patient's physical examination findings are consistent with acute appendicitis. She has tenderness in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen.
* The imaging tests are consistent with acute appendicitis. The CT scan shows a mass in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen.
* The patient's history is consistent with acute appendicitis. She has a history of nephrolithiasis, which is a condition that can increase the risk of developing acute appendicitis.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely for the following reasons:

* Cecal diverticulum is a condition in which small pouches form in the lining of the cecum. It is a common condition, especially in older adults. However, it is not usually associated with right lower quadrant pain.
* Carcinoid tumor of the appendix is a rare type of cancer that can develop in the appendix. It is usually not associated with right lower quadrant pain.
* Appendiceal intussusception is a condition in which the appendix telescopes into itself. It is a rare condition, especially in adults. It is usually not associated with right lower quadrant pain.

Explanation:

The patient is a 66-year-old man with a slowly enlarging growth in his mouth that appeared more than 20 years ago. He denies pain and discomfort but is concerned because the mass has increased in size during the past year. He does not wear dentures and denies trauma, use of tobacco products, poor nutrition, and risky sexual practices. Family history is noncontributory. Physical examination reveals a healthy appearing male with a nontender, symmetric, nodular bony protuberance on the midline of the hard palate. Two prominent protuberances are also noted at the bilateral maxillary tuberosities. The remainder of the examination is unremarkable.

The most likely diagnosis is an osteoma, which is a benign tumor of bone. Osteomas are typically slow-growing and asymptomatic, and they rarely require treatment. However, if the lesion is causing pain or discomfort, or if it is growing rapidly, it may be necessary to remove it.

The next step in the management of this patient is to refer him to an oral surgeon for evaluation and full-mouth dental x-rays. The oral surgeon will be able to perform a more detailed examination of the lesion and determine if it is an osteoma or another type of tumor. If the lesion is an osteoma, the oral surgeon may recommend removing it to prevent it from growing larger or causing further problems.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Option A (do not intervene; the condition is benign) is incorrect because the lesion is unknown and could be a malignant tumor. Option B (perform a biopsy of the lesion) is incorrect because a biopsy is not necessary to diagnose an osteoma. Option C (obtain a computed tomography scan of the head) is incorrect because a computed tomography scan is not necessary to diagnose an osteoma.

The patient has a chronic nail pigmentation that has been present for 10 years. She has no associated symptoms, including nail splitting, bleeding, or pain, and no history of acute or recurrent trauma. Several years previously, she was reassured that her nail pigmentation was benign. However, the recent widening and darkening of the pigmented band, as well as the spread of pigment to the proximal nail fold and distal acral hyponychial skin, are concerning for a more serious condition, such as melanoma. Therefore, a punch biopsy of the nail bed through intact nail plate is the most appropriate next step. This will allow for histological examination of the pigmented area to determine the underlying cause.

A is incorrect because it is premature to reassure the patient that her nail pigmentation is benign. The recent changes in her nail pigmentation are concerning for a more serious condition, such as melanoma.

C is incorrect because it is unnecessary to remove the entire nail plate. A punch biopsy of the nail bed through intact nail plate is sufficient to obtain a representative sample of the pigmented area.

D is incorrect because it is not necessary to send clippings of the free edge of the nail plate for histopathology and culture. A punch biopsy of the nail bed through intact nail plate is the most appropriate diagnostic test.

The patient has a history of cirrhosis secondary to hepatitis C, which is a liver disease. The cotton-wool spots and retinal hemorrhages are findings that are consistent with portal hypertension, which is a condition that can occur in people with cirrhosis. Portal hypertension is a high blood pressure in the portal vein, which is the vein that carries blood from the intestines to the liver. High blood pressure in the portal vein can cause blood to back up in the small veins in the retina, which can lead to cotton-wool spots and retinal hemorrhages.

It is important to contact the patient's hepatologist to discuss the findings and to determine if any further testing or treatment is needed. The hepatologist may order blood tests to assess the patient's liver function and to look for other signs of portal hypertension. The hepatologist may also recommend that the patient see an ophthalmologist for further evaluation of the eye findings.

The other options are not correct because they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Option A, checking hemoglobin A1c level, would be appropriate if the patient had diabetes, but there is no evidence that the patient has diabetes. Option B, checking for hypertension, would be appropriate if the patient had hypertension, but there is no evidence that the patient has hypertension. Option C, discontinuing interferon therapy, would be appropriate if the interferon therapy was causing the patient's symptoms, but there is no evidence that the interferon therapy is causing the patient's symptoms.

The patient is a 9-week-old girl with a rash on her back that has been present for 7 weeks. The rash was asymptomatic and started as red bumps that then evolved into pustules and blisters. On further questioning, it was discovered that the patient’s father worked in a nursing home that had experienced a recent outbreak of scabies. Shortly after the onset of the outbreak, the patient and all family members were treated with 2 once-weekly doses of permethrin, 5%, cream. All other family members had significant improvement with the treatment; however, our patient’s lesions continued to worsen during the subsequent 2 weeks. On physical examination, the patient had numerous erythematous macules, papules, and pustules on her back. Many of the lesions had superimposed hemorrhagic crust and surrounding scale. In addition, several grouped papules were noted, including some in a linear array. The rest of her cutaneous examination results were unremarkable except for a few fading pink papules noted on her left abdomen.

Scabies is a contagious skin infection caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. The mite burrows into the skin and lays eggs, which cause an allergic reaction in the host. The rash is typically characterized by small, red, itchy bumps that are often found in a linear or zigzag pattern. In infants, the rash may be more widespread and may include papules, pustules, and crusting.

The diagnosis of scabies is usually made based on the history and physical examination. In some cases, a skin scraping may be taken to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment for scabies is with topical permethrin cream or oral ivermectin. All household members and close contacts should be treated at the same time to prevent the spread of the infection.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disorder of the immune system that can affect the skin, bones, liver, and other organs. It is characterized by the accumulation of Langerhans cells, a type of white blood cell, in the affected tissues. The rash associated with Langerhans cell histiocytosis is typically widespread and may include papules, nodules, and ulcers.
* Contact dermatitis is a skin reaction caused by contact with an irritant or allergen. The rash is typically characterized by redness, itching, and swelling. The rash may be localized to the area of contact with the irritant or allergen, but it may also be widespread.
* Postscabetic acropustulosis is a rare condition that can occur after a scabies infection. It is characterized by the development of small, red, itchy papules and pustules on the hands, feet, and face. The rash typically resolves within a few weeks.

A hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm is a false aneurysm that occurs when the wall of the hepatic artery weakens and ruptures. This can be caused by trauma, infection, or a blood clot. The symptoms of a hepatic artery pseudoaneurysm include abdominal pain, fever, and jaundice. Treatment usually involves surgery to repair or remove the aneurysm.

A neuroendocrine tumor is a type of cancer that starts in the cells that produce hormones. Neuroendocrine tumors can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, and pancreas. The symptoms of a neuroendocrine tumor depend on the location of the tumor. Treatment usually involves surgery to remove the tumor, followed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

Angiosarcoma is a rare type of cancer that starts in the blood vessels. Angiosarcoma can occur anywhere in the body, but it is most common in the liver, skin, and soft tissues. The symptoms of angiosarcoma depend on the location of the tumor. Treatment usually involves surgery to remove the tumor, followed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy.

In this case, the patient is a previously healthy, 37-year-old man who presented for a routine physical examination during which a pulsatile mass in his midepigastrium was palpated. Abdominal ultrasonography showed a well-defined hypoechoic lesion abutting the pancreas. Further imaging by contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) and 3-dimensional reconstruction revealed a well-circumscribed, 3-cm lesion surrounding the common hepatic artery. The lesion demonstrated patchy arterial enhancement, and a small irregularity of the common hepatic artery was present within the lesion. Endoscopic ultrasonography demonstrated a hypoechoic, well-defined mass; fine-needle aspiration showed no abnormal cells within the paucicellular specimen. Surgical exploration revealed a firm, ovoid lesion surrounding the hepatic artery at the origin of the gastroduodenal artery. Following resection, the lesion was bisected to reveal a smooth white arterial lumen surrounded by grayish fibrotic tissue with punctate hemorrhagic foci. Histologic sections of the specimen demonstrated small, singly dispersed vessels embedded in a background of fascicles of spindled cells with monotonous, fusiform nuclei and abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm. Focally, areas of myxoid degeneration were present. Despite extensive sampling, no mitotic activity, cytologic atypia, or areas of necrosis were identified. There was strong, diffuse cytoplasmic staining for desmin (Figure, D), and staining results for S100 were negative. Furthermore, CD34 stained strongly positive in vessels but failed to highlight the intervening stroma.

Based on the history, physical examination, imaging studies, and pathology findings, the most likely diagnosis is angioleiomyoma. Angioleiomyomas are benign tumors that are composed of smooth muscle cells. They are most commonly found in the skin and subcutaneous tissue, but they can also occur in the gastrointestinal tract, retroperitoneum, and other organs. Angioleiomyomas are usually asymptomatic, but they can cause pain, bleeding, or mass effect. Treatment is usually not necessary, but surgery may be indicated if the tumor is symptomatic or if it is causing complications.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely based on the clinical presentation and findings. Hepatic artery pseudoaneurysms are usually caused by trauma, infection, or a blood clot. They are typically associated with abdominal pain, fever, and jaundice. Neuroendocrine tumors can occur anywhere in the body, but they are most common in the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, and pancreas. They are typically associated with symptoms that are related to the hormone that the tumor is producing. Angiosarcoma is a rare type of cancer that starts in the blood vessels. It is typically associated with symptoms that are related to the location of the tumor.

Rectal prolapse is a condition in which the rectum (the last part of the large intestine) descends through the anus. It is most common in women, especially those who have had multiple births. Rectal prolapse can be partial or complete. In partial prolapse, only part of the rectum descends through the anus. In complete prolapse, the entire rectum descends.

Rectal prolapse can cause a variety of symptoms, including:

* A feeling of fullness or pressure in the rectum
* Pain or bleeding from the rectum
* Difficulty passing stool
* Incontinence

If you have any of these symptoms, it is important to see a doctor. Rectal prolapse can be treated with surgery or other procedures.

The other answers are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Hedrocele is a protrusion of the bladder through the urethra.
* Anal neoplasm is a tumor of the anus.
* External hemorrhoids are swollen veins in the anus.

In this case, the patient has a painful anal mass that is exteriorized through the anal canal. The mass is covered by hypoxemic rectal mucosa, but no digestive lumen could be identified inside the mass. The patient also has a distended abdomen, absent bowel sounds, and no tenderness to palpation. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of rectal prolapse.

Explanation:
The most likely diagnosis in this case is erythema multiforme minor (EM minor), a self-limited, acute, inflammatory skin disease characterized by the sudden onset of targetoid lesions on the palms and soles. EM minor is often associated with a viral infection, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) or Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). A skin biopsy is the most definitive way to diagnose EM minor, and it can also help to identify the underlying cause of the condition. A chest radiograph is not necessary in this case, as there is no evidence of pneumonia or other pulmonary infection. A rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test is used to screen for syphilis, but it is not indicated in this case as the patient does not have any symptoms of syphilis. A viral culture from a lip lesion may be helpful in diagnosing the underlying viral infection, but it is not necessary to make the diagnosis of EM minor.

The patient is immunocompromised due to his treatment for multiple sclerosis. This makes him more susceptible to infections, including both bacterial and fungal infections. The skin lesions are suggestive of both bacterial and fungal infection, so it is important to obtain cultures from both areas to identify the specific organisms involved. Once the organisms are identified, the appropriate treatment can be started.

A systemic antibiotic is necessary to treat any bacterial infection. A systemic antifungal agent is necessary to treat any fungal infection. Topical antibiotics and antifungals are not effective in treating systemic infections.

Obtaining a skin biopsy is not necessary in this case. The skin lesions are suggestive of both bacterial and fungal infection, and cultures will provide more information about the specific organisms involved. A biopsy would only be necessary if the cultures were negative.

Starting a systemic antibiotic without first obtaining cultures is not recommended. This could lead to the patient being treated with an unnecessary antibiotic, which could have adverse effects.

Starting a systemic antifungal without first obtaining cultures is not recommended. This could lead to the patient being treated with an unnecessary antifungal, which could have adverse effects.

The patient in this case has a number of features that are concerning for a genetic condition, including:

* The presence of pigmented ocular fundus lesions (POFLs), which can be associated with a number of genetic conditions, including von Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL) and neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1).
* A family history of cancer, which is also a risk factor for VHL and NF1.
* The absence of other significant medical history or prior ocular problems, which makes it less likely that the POFLs are due to an acquired condition.

Given these findings, it is important to inquire about the patient's family cancer history and order genetic testing to rule out a genetic condition. If a genetic condition is found, this can help to guide treatment and surveillance for the patient.

Pars plana vitrectomy and retinal biopsy are invasive procedures that are not necessary in this case. Diode laser treatment to lesions is also not necessary, as the POFLs are not causing any visual symptoms. Metastatic workup is not necessary, as there is no evidence of metastatic disease.

Explanation:

The most likely diagnosis in this case is minocycline-induced cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa (MPCN). This is a rare adverse effect of minocycline, a tetracycline antibiotic that is used to treat a variety of infections. MPCN is characterized by the development of necrotizing vasculitis, which is inflammation of the blood vessels. This can lead to the formation of ulcers, livedo reticularis, and other skin lesions. Patients with MPCN may also experience systemic symptoms such as fever, arthralgia, and myalgia.

The patient in this case presents with a number of features that are consistent with MPCN. She has a history of taking minocycline, and she developed a solitary painful bullous skin lesion over the lower right anterior tibia accompanied by generalized myalgia, polyarthalgia, joint stiffness, paraesthesia, and episodic ankle swelling. Her physical examination revealed mild synovitis in both ankles and an erythematous, raised papule overlying the distal aspect of the right anterior tibia. Seven weeks later, the original skin lesion evolved into an ulcer with erythematous, raised borders. She also developed new eruptions of nonindurated, violaceous, nontender, reticulated patches overlying the skin on the bilateral anterior tibias, consistent with livedo reticularis.

The laboratory findings in this case are also consistent with MPCN. The patient has a positive antinuclear antibody 1:640 nucleolar pattern, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and elevated C-reactive protein and serum IgG levels. These findings suggest the presence of an inflammatory process.

The patient's chest radiography was normal, which rules out sarcoidosis. Erythema nodosum is a condition that is characterized by the development of tender, red nodules on the shins. It is often associated with infections, such as streptococcal pharyngitis or tuberculosis. Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic autoimmune disease that can affect many different parts of the body, including the skin, joints, kidneys, and heart. The patient in this case does not have any of the classic features of systemic lupus erythematosus, such as a butterfly rash, photosensitivity, or Raynaud's phenomenon.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis in this case is minocycline-induced cutaneous polyarteritis nodosa. This is a rare adverse effect of minocycline, a tetracycline antibiotic that is used to treat a variety of infections. MPCN is characterized by the development of necrotizing vasculitis, which is inflammation of the blood vessels. This can lead to the formation of ulcers, livedo reticularis, and other skin lesions. Patients with MPCN may also experience systemic symptoms such as fever, arthralgia, and myalgia.

Explanation:

The patient is a 74-year-old woman with a 1-year history of dull epigastric and right upper quadrant abdominal pain. She has no significant past medical history. Her physical examination is unremarkable. Routine laboratory values are within normal limits. An abdominal ultrasound reveals two cystic lesions in the liver. Magnetic resonance imaging of the abdomen reveals two multiloculated cystic lesions in segments IV and V of the liver. Additional laboratory values include normal carcinoembryonic antigen and cancer antigen 19-9 levels. Percutaneous aspiration with a biopsy of one of the cystic lesions reveals atypical cells suspicious for malignancy. The patient is then referred for management to our institution, where she undergoes an exploratory laparotomy and enucleation of these two complex multiloculated cystic lesions.

The differential diagnosis for cystic lesions in the liver includes biliary cystadenomas, cystic hepatocellular carcinomas, and metastatic cystic neuroendocrine tumors. However, the patient's history, physical examination, laboratory findings, and imaging studies are most consistent with a diagnosis of amebic liver abscess secondary to Entamoeba histolytica infection.

Amebic liver abscess is a common infection in developing countries, where it is estimated to affect 10-20 million people annually. The infection is caused by the protozoan parasite Entamoeba histolytica, which is acquired by ingestion of contaminated food or water. Once in the human body, the parasite invades the intestinal mucosa and can spread to the liver via the portal vein.

The most common presentation of amebic liver abscess is fever, abdominal pain, and right upper quadrant tenderness. Laboratory findings may include elevated liver enzymes, leukocytosis, and anemia. Imaging studies such as abdominal ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) scan can show a single or multiple cystic lesions in the liver.

The treatment of amebic liver abscess is with metronidazole, an antibiotic that is effective against E. histolytica. In some cases, percutaneous drainage of the abscess may be necessary. The prognosis for amebic liver abscess is good with treatment, although recurrence is possible.

The other options in the differential diagnosis are less likely in this patient. Biliary cystadenomas are benign tumors that are typically found in women of reproductive age. They are often multiple and can grow large. Cystic hepatocellular carcinomas are rare, aggressive tumors that are more common in men. Metastatic cystic neuroendocrine tumors are also rare and are usually associated with a known primary tumor.

 97%|█████████▋| 1483/1525 [5:37:31<09:34, 13.68s/it]The correct answer is: A. Metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma.

The patient has a history of synchronous rectal cancer, which is a type of cancer that starts in the rectum. She also received pelvic irradiation and 60 Gy irradiation to the left breast and axillary basin. This type of radiation therapy can increase the risk of developing a secondary cancer, such as a sarcoma.

The patient's current symptoms, including a hard, well-circumscribed, fixed mass in the upper, outer quadrant of her left breast, are consistent with a sarcoma. The mass is not tender to palpation nor is there any associated axillary or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. This suggests that the mass is not breast cancer, as breast cancer typically causes lymphadenopathy.

The CT scan of the thorax revealed a 6.7 × 4 cm mass arising from the left chest wall distinct from the left breast with extent to the pleural surface of the left thorax. This is also consistent with a sarcoma.

The positron emission tomography revealed metabolic activity within the mass but did not reveal any distant disease. This suggests that the mass is localized and has not spread to other parts of the body.

The core needle biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of a sarcoma.

Based on the patient's history, physical examination, imaging studies, and biopsy results, the most likely diagnosis is metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma.

Explanation:
The patient has a history of hepatitis B, hepatocellular carcinoma, and idiopathic pancreatitis. He has a 2-month history of tender nodules on the extremities that are initially very painful and slow to resolve. New lesions tend to appear with, or immediately after, episodes of acute pancreatitis. Laboratory evaluation reveals elevated levels of serum lipase (2700 IU/L) and amylase (3400 IU/L). Previous treatments have included incision and drainage of a nodule on the right foot as well as oral and intravenous administration of antistaphylococcal antibiotics for presumed cellulitis. Examination of the skin reveals erythematous subcutaneous nodules symmetrically distributed on the bilateral lower and upper extremities, primarily on the lower legs and feet. One of the largest nodules has a small amount of yellow, oily discharge. The patient is afebrile and reports nausea, vomiting, and arthralgias.

The most likely diagnosis is pancreatic panniculitis, a rare inflammatory condition of the subcutaneous fat that is associated with pancreatitis. Pancreatic panniculitis can be idiopathic or secondary to a number of conditions, including pancreatic cancer, autoimmune diseases, and infections.

The initial management of pancreatic panniculitis is supportive, with treatment of the underlying condition if possible. In some cases, surgical excision of the affected tissue may be necessary.

The incisional skin biopsy is the most important diagnostic test for pancreatic panniculitis. The biopsy will show a characteristic inflammatory infiltrate of lymphocytes, neutrophils, and macrophages. The presence of fat necrosis is also a helpful diagnostic feature.

The other options are not the most appropriate next steps in the management of this patient.

* Obtaining a blood culture is not necessary, as the patient does not have fever or other signs of infection.
* Obtaining a computed tomography scan of the chest and abdomen is not necessary, as the patient does not have any symptoms or signs of an underlying malignancy.
* Ordering a tuberculin purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test is not necessary, as the patient does not have any symptoms or signs of tuberculosis.

Explanation:

Erythema annulare centrifugum (EAC) is a common, benign, self-limiting skin condition characterized by ring-shaped lesions with central clearing and peripheral scaling. It is most commonly seen in children and young adults, and there is no gender predilection. The cause of EAC is unknown, but it is thought to be an autoimmune reaction.

The typical presentation of EAC is a single or multiple ring-shaped lesions on the trunk, extremities, or face. The lesions are typically 2-10 cm in diameter, and they may be erythematous, violaceous, or brown. The central area of the lesion is often clear, and the peripheral border may be scaly. The lesions may be pruritic, but they are usually not painful.

The diagnosis of EAC is made based on the clinical presentation. There is no specific laboratory test or imaging study that is diagnostic of EAC. Treatment is typically not necessary, as the lesions will resolve on their own within a few months. However, topical corticosteroids or oral antihistamines may be used to relieve pruritus.

The other options are incorrect because they do not fit the clinical presentation of the patient. Numular eczema is a chronic, relapsing skin condition characterized by small, coin-shaped lesions that are often itchy and inflamed. Erythema chronicum migrans is a skin rash that is caused by infection with the Borrelia burgdorferi bacterium, which is the causative agent of Lyme disease.

Glucagonomas are rare neuroendocrine tumors that arise from the alpha cells of the pancreas. They are associated with a number of clinical features, including necrolytic migratory erythema (NME), diabetes mellitus, weight loss, and thromboembolic events. NME is a characteristic skin rash that is characterized by erythema, bullae, and ulcerations. It is often the presenting symptom of glucagonoma.

The patient in the case presented with a skin rash, diabetes mellitus, and weight loss. He also had a history of ischemic heart disease, familial Mediterranean fever, and arthropathy. These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of glucagonoma.

The other answer choices are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Insulinoma is a neuroendocrine tumor that arises from the beta cells of the pancreas. It is associated with hypoglycemia, which is not a feature of the patient's presentation.
* VIPoma is a neuroendocrine tumor that arises from the pancreatic islet cells. It is associated with watery diarrhea, hypokalemia, and achlorhydria. These findings are not present in the patient's presentation.
* Skin amyloidosis is a disorder of protein deposition in the skin. It is not associated with the other features of the patient's presentation.

 98%|█████████▊| 1487/1525 [5:38:23<07:54, 12.50s/it]The correct answer is: **C. Calcific uremic arteriolopathy.**

Calcific uremic arteriolopathy is a condition that occurs in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). It is characterized by the deposition of calcium salts in the walls of small arteries, which can lead to narrowing of the arteries and decreased blood flow to the extremities. This can result in pain, numbness, and skin ulcers. In severe cases, it can lead to gangrene and amputation.

The patient in this case has a number of risk factors for calcic uremic arteriolopathy, including ESRD, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension. He also has a history of warfarin use, which can increase the risk of bleeding complications. The skin biopsy specimen shows epidermal necrosis, dermal hemorrhage, focal dermal intravascular thrombi, and subcutaneous intravascular and extravascular calcifications, which are all characteristic findings of calcic uremic arteriolopathy.

Subacute bacterial endocarditis is an infection of the heart valves that can occur in patients with underlying heart disease. It is characterized by fever, chills, and a heart murmur. The skin biopsy specimen in this case does not show any evidence of infection.

Warfarin-induced skin necrosis is a rare but serious complication of warfarin therapy. It is characterized by the sudden onset of painful skin necrosis, usually in the lower extremities. The patient in this case has been taking warfarin for several years, but he does not have any evidence of warfarin-induced skin necrosis.

Buerger disease is a rare inflammatory disease of the small and medium arteries that occurs in smokers. It is characterized by the development of thrombotic occlusion of the arteries, which can lead to pain, ischemia, and gangrene of the extremities. The patient in this case does not smoke, and he does not have any evidence of Buerger disease.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is calcic uremic arteriolopathy.

 98%|█████████▊| 1488/1525 [5:38:39<08:25, 13.65s/it]The correct answer is: A. Perform angioplasty and stenting of the right renal and external iliac arteries.

The patient in this case has exertional right buttock and thigh pain that resolves within 2 minutes of rest. This is a classic presentation of intermittent claudication, which is caused by narrowing of the arteries that supply blood to the legs. In this case, the CTA findings reveal a “beaded appearance” in the right renal artery and a long-segment stenosis of the right external iliac artery. These findings are consistent with fibromuscular dysplasia, a nonatherosclerotic disease that can cause narrowing of the arteries.

The treatment for fibromuscular dysplasia is usually angioplasty and stenting. Angioplasty is a procedure in which a balloon is inserted into the narrowed artery and inflated, which widens the artery. Stenting is a procedure in which a small metal tube (stent) is inserted into the widened artery to keep it open.

In this case, the patient has both renal and iliac artery involvement. Angioplasty and stenting of the right renal artery is necessary to improve blood flow to the kidney and prevent kidney failure. Angioplasty and stenting of the right external iliac artery is necessary to improve blood flow to the leg and relieve the patient's claudication.

Options B, C, and D are incorrect because they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms. Option B, managing medically with antihypertensive agents and a walking program, would not improve the patient's claudication. Option C, performing angioplasty of the right renal artery and angioplasty with stenting of the right external iliac artery, would not address the patient's renal artery involvement. Option D, administering cilostazol for claudication and continuing lisinopril for hypertension, would not address the patient's iliac artery involvement.

Therefore, the correct answer is A. Perform angioplasty and stenting of the right renal and external iliac arteries.

Explanation:

Ecthyma gangrenosum is a rare, rapidly progressive, skin infection that is most commonly seen in immunocompromised patients, especially those with hematologic malignancies, solid organ transplants, or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. It is caused by a variety of bacteria, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Klebsiella pneumoniae.

The characteristic lesion of ecthyma gangrenosum is a violaceous papule or pustule that rapidly ulcerates and forms a necrotic eschar. The lesions are typically located on the extremities, but can occur anywhere on the body.

The diagnosis of ecthyma gangrenosum is made clinically, based on the characteristic appearance of the lesions. Laboratory tests, such as blood cultures, may be helpful in identifying the causative organism.

Treatment of ecthyma gangrenosum is with antibiotics, such as ceftazidime or meropenem. In severe cases, surgical debridement may be necessary.

The prognosis for ecthyma gangrenosum is good with prompt treatment. However, the disease can be fatal if left untreated.

The other options are incorrect because they are not typically seen in newborns. Pyoderma gangrenosum is a pyogenic skin infection that is more common in adults, while Wegener granulomatosis and meningococcemia are systemic diseases that are more likely to affect older children and adults.

The patient has a history of colon cancer, and the physical examination reveals a firm, nonpulsatile, slightly tender mass in the left lower quadrant. The laboratory test results show an elevated white blood cell count, which is consistent with an inflammatory process. The computed tomography scan shows a mass in the left lower quadrant that is displacing the bladder and rectum. These findings are all consistent with recurrent colon cancer.

Prostate cancer is less likely because the patient does not have any urinary symptoms, such as frequency, urgency, or hesitancy. Internal iliac artery aneurysm is also less likely because the patient does not have any abdominal pain, back pain, or leg pain. Primary lymphoma of the urinary bladder is also less likely because the patient does not have any urinary symptoms, and the computed tomography scan does not show any evidence of a mass in the bladder.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis is recurrent colon cancer.

Pulmonary aspergilloma is a fungal infection that can occur in the lungs. It is most common in people with chronic lung disease, such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis. The infection can cause a ball-like mass to form in the lung, which can then lead to hemoptysis (coughing up blood).

The diagnosis of pulmonary aspergilloma is made based on the patient's history, physical examination, and imaging studies. Chest X-ray or CT scan can show a cavitary lesion with a central contrast-enhanced ball-like mass. Sputum examinations for acid-fast bacilli smear and culture, fungal culture, and cytology are usually negative.

Pulmonary aspergilloma is usually treated with antifungal medications. However, if the infection is severe or if the patient has other health problems, surgery may be necessary to remove the mass.

The other options are incorrect because:

* Pulmonary tuberculosis is a bacterial infection that can cause a variety of symptoms, including cough, fever, and weight loss. It is most commonly spread through the air when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
* Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of lung cancer that starts in the squamous cells that line the airways. It is the most common type of lung cancer in men and the second most common type in women.
* Pulmonary hydatid cyst is a parasitic infection that can cause a cyst to form in the lungs. It is most common in people who live in areas where there is a lot of sheep or cattle.

* Answer: **B. Initiate treatment for cerebral vasculitis with corticosteroids.**
* Explanation:

The patient presented with multiple cerebral infarctions and intracranial vessel abnormalities. The laboratory studies revealed an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), anemia, and high serum levels of soluble interleukin 2 receptor (sIL2R), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and β2-microglobulin. These findings are suggestive of vasculitis. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed multiple infarctions, and digital subtraction angiography of the intracranial vessels demonstrated abnormalities suggestive of vasculitis. These findings confirm the diagnosis of cerebral vasculitis.

Cerebral vasculitis is an inflammatory disorder of the blood vessels in the brain. It can cause a variety of symptoms, including headache, seizures, stroke, and cognitive impairment. The treatment for cerebral vasculitis depends on the underlying cause. In most cases, corticosteroids are used to suppress the inflammation. Other medications, such as immunosuppressants, may also be necessary.

In this case, the patient's symptoms are severe and she is at risk for further neurological damage. Therefore, it is important to start treatment for cerebral vasculitis as soon as possible. Corticosteroids are the first-line treatment for cerebral vasculitis. They are effective in suppressing the inflammation and reducing the risk of further neurological damage. Other medications, such as immunosuppressants, may also be necessary.

The other options are incorrect because they do not provide the patient with the most appropriate treatment for her condition. Option A, to initiate secondary preventive treatment for multiple infarctions with antiplatelet agents, is not appropriate because the patient's condition is not caused by a blood clot. Option C, to postpone treatment and obtain a brain biopsy including the leptomeninges, is not appropriate because the patient's condition is already well-established and a brain biopsy would not provide any additional information. Option D, to postpone treatment and obtain random skin biopsies and a bone marrow biopsy, is not appropriate because the patient's condition is not caused by a systemic disorder.

Explanation:

The patient presents with a generalized, annular, vesiculobullous eruption. The most common causes of this type of eruption include bullous impetigo, pemphigus vulgaris, and herpes zoster. Bullous impetigo is a bacterial infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus or Streptococcus pyogenes. It is characterized by small, flaccid bullae that rupture easily and form honey-colored crusts. Pemphigus vulgaris is an autoimmune disorder that causes the formation of large, flaccid bullae. It is associated with a high risk of scarring and secondary infection. Herpes zoster is a viral infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus. It is characterized by the development of a painful, vesicular rash in a dermatomal distribution.

The patient's history and physical examination are most consistent with bullous impetigo. However, it is important to rule out other possible causes, such as pemphigus vulgaris and herpes zoster. The next step in the evaluation is to obtain a blister fluid culture, Gram stain, and viral polymerase chain reaction assay. This will help to determine the cause of the eruption and guide the treatment.

Topical corticosteroids are not indicated for the treatment of bullous impetigo. They may actually worsen the infection by suppressing the immune system. Transfer to a burn unit is not necessary for the treatment of bullous impetigo.

Therefore, the next step in the evaluation of this patient is to obtain a blister fluid culture, Gram stain, and viral polymerase chain reaction assay.

The patient is a 49-year-old woman who noticed a "smudge" in the central vision of her right eye with associated photopsias. On examination, visual acuity measured 20/50 OD. Her local ophthalmologist considered a white dot syndrome and recommended a systemic workup. Results of a complete blood cell count, comprehensive metabolic panel, antinuclear antibodies (including DNA and ribosomal SSA/Ro), positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain, mammography, and chest radiography were normal. Dermatologic examination revealed a nevus on the left arm, a nevus on her left shoulder, and seborrheic keratosis on her left shoulder. Three months later, at the Illinois Eye and Ear Infirmary, she reported an improvement in her vision but noted negative images of dots when her right eye was closed. Review of systems was negative. Visual acuities measured 20/30 OD and 20/20 OS. Slitlamp examination findings were normal; there were no anterior chamber or vitreous cells. Funduscopic examination revealed yellow-white, multisized, subretinal, creamy lesions clumped in various portions of her retina, including the periphery (Figure 1). The lesions were smaller in the posterior pole and larger in the periphery. Subretinal serous fluid was present overlying some of the prominent lesions inferiorly, without associated exudate or hemorrhage.

The differential diagnosis for white dot syndrome includes multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and other autoimmune diseases. In this case, the patient's systemic workup was negative for these conditions. The fundus findings are also consistent with white dot syndrome. White dot syndrome is a benign condition that is often self-limited. In some cases, it may progress to retinal detachment. However, in this case, the patient's vision has improved and there is no evidence of retinal detachment. Therefore, the best course of action is to observe the patient and monitor her vision. If her vision worsens or if she develops any new symptoms, then further treatment may be necessary.

A. Observation is the correct answer because it is the most appropriate course of action given the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings. The patient's vision has improved and there is no evidence of retinal detachment. Therefore, there is no need to start treatment at this time. Observation will allow the patient's condition to be monitored and any new symptoms to be identified. If the patient's vision worsens or if she develops any new symptoms, then further treatment may be necessary.

B. Oral corticosteroid is not the correct answer because it is not necessary in this case. The patient's vision has improved and there is no evidence of retinal detachment. Therefore, there is no need to start treatment with oral corticosteroids. Oral corticosteroids can have serious side effects, including hypertension, diabetes, and osteoporosis. Therefore, they should only be used when necessary.

C. Vitreous biopsy is not the correct answer because it is not necessary in this case. The patient's vision has improved and there is no evidence of retinal detachment. Therefore, there is no need to perform a vitreous biopsy. Vitreous biopsy is a surgical procedure that is used to diagnose and treat retinal diseases. It is a relatively invasive procedure that carries a risk of complications, such as infection and bleeding. Therefore, it should only be used when necessary.

D. Extended workup is not the correct answer because it is not necessary in this case. The patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are all consistent with white dot syndrome. White dot syndrome is a benign condition that is often self-limited. In some cases, it may progress to retinal detachment. However, in this case, the patient's vision has improved and there is no evidence of retinal detachment. Therefore, there is no need to perform an extended workup. An extended workup would include additional tests, such as a lumbar puncture, chest CT scan, and brain MRI. These tests are not necessary in this case because the patient's history, physical examination, and laboratory findings are all consistent with white dot syndrome.

Explanation:

ILVEN is a rare, non-cancerous skin condition that typically presents as a linear, verrucous, inflammatory plaque on the face or neck. It is most commonly diagnosed in children and young adults, and is more common in females. The exact cause of ILVEN is unknown, but it is thought to be a developmental disorder of the skin.

The clinical features of ILVEN vary, but the most common presentation is a linear, verrucous, inflammatory plaque on the face or neck. The plaque is typically skin-colored or light brown, and may be scaly, crusted, or erythematous. It may also be associated with hair loss, hyperhidrosis, and lymphadenopathy.

The diagnosis of ILVEN is based on clinical findings. There is no specific laboratory test or biopsy finding that is diagnostic of ILVEN. Treatment for ILVEN is often unsatisfactory, and there is no cure. Treatment options include topical steroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and oral retinoids. In some cases, surgery may be necessary to remove the lesion.

The differential diagnosis of ILVEN includes other inflammatory skin conditions, such as psoriasis, lichen planus, and linear epidermal nevus. However, ILVEN is typically distinguished from these conditions by its linear presentation and its association with hair loss, hyperhidrosis, and lymphadenopathy.

In the case of the 15-year-old male with a lesion on his right nasal sidewall, the most likely diagnosis is ILVEN. The lesion has been present since birth, and has expanded in size, become irritated, and developed a papillated, rough texture. The patient has no significant medical history and is in good health. On physical examination, there is a 3.6-cm × 1.5-cm verrucous skin-colored to light-brown plaque on the right nasal sidewall. These findings are consistent with the diagnosis of ILVEN.

Explanation:
The most likely diagnosis is carcinoma of the cecum. The patient is a 32-year-old woman with a 2-week history of colicky abdominal pain that radiates to the right iliac fossa. The pain is worse with meals and is associated with nausea but no vomiting. In the last 2 days, the pain has been associated with loose stools, but there is no mucus or blood. The patient has no comorbidities, such as diabetes mellitus or hypertension, and no previous admission to the hospital. She is married and has 4 children; her last child was born 40 days prior to her presentation to the hospital. On examination, her vital signs are normal (temperature, 37.1°C; pulse, 86 beats/min; and blood pressure, 121/86 mm Hg). Her abdomen is soft and lax. There is mild tenderness in the right iliac fossa, but no lump or lumps are felt. Bowel sounds are not exaggerated. Her white blood cell count is 8500/μL (to convert to ×109 per liter, multiply by 0.001), her hemoglobin level is 1.3 g/dL (to convert to grams per liter, multiply by 10.0), and her platelet count is 361 × 103/μL (to convert to ×109 per liter, multiply by 1.0). The results of renal and liver function tests are normal. Abdominal ultrasonography revealed a 4.2 × 4.2-cm mass in the midabdominal region lateral to the gall bladder fossa. The mass has the “donut sign” with central echogenicity (Figure 1A). An abdominal computed tomographic scan (Figure 1B) showed a 8.2 × 4 × 2.6-cm tubular thin-walled filling defect in the cecum and lower part of ascending colon. The oral contrast agent can be seen around, proximal, and distal to the defect, with no obstruction noted.

The “donut sign” on abdominal ultrasonography is a characteristic finding of carcinoma of the cecum. The mass is typically hypoechoic, with a central echogenic area representing the necrotic core of the tumor. The CT scan findings are also consistent with carcinoma of the cecum. The mass is a well-defined, tubular, thin-walled structure that is located in the cecum. The oral contrast agent can be seen around, proximal, and distal to the mass, with no obstruction noted.

The other possible diagnoses are ileocecal intussusception, intussusception of the appendix, and diverticulum of the cecum. Ileocecal intussusception is a condition in which a portion of the ileum telescopes into the cecum. It is most common in children, but it can also occur in adults. The symptoms of ileocecal intussusception include abdominal pain, vomiting, and bloody diarrhea. On examination, the patient may have a sausage-shaped mass in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. The diagnosis is made with abdominal radiography or CT scan. Treatment is surgical removal of the intussusception.

Intussusception of the appendix is a rare condition in which the appendix telescopes into the cecum. It is most common in children, but it can also occur in adults. The symptoms of intussusception of the appendix include abdominal pain, vomiting, and fever. On examination, the patient may have a tender mass in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. The diagnosis is made with abdominal radiography or CT scan. Treatment is surgical removal of the appendix.

Diverticulum of the cecum is a small, sac-like protrusion of the lining of the colon. It is most common in people over the age of 50. The symptoms of diverticulum of the cecum include abdominal pain, bloating, and constipation. On examination, the patient may have a tender mass in the right lower quadrant of the abdomen. The diagnosis is made with abdominal radiography or CT scan. Treatment is usually conservative, with dietary changes and medication. Surgery may be necessary if the diverticulum is infected or bleeding.

In conclusion, the most likely diagnosis for this patient is carcinoma of the cecum. The patient's history, physical examination, and imaging findings are all consistent with this diagnosis.

Explanation:

A duplicate gallbladder is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by the presence of two gallbladders. It is usually asymptomatic and is often discovered incidentally on imaging studies. Treatment is not required unless the patient develops symptoms or complications.

A biliary cystadenoma is a benign tumor of the biliary tree. It is usually found in women in their 40s and 50s. Symptoms may include abdominal pain, jaundice, and pancreatitis. Treatment is surgical excision.

A hydatid cyst is a parasitic cyst caused by the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus. It is most common in sheep-raising areas of the world. Symptoms may include abdominal pain, fever, and weight loss. Treatment is surgical excision.

Choledochal cysts are congenital anomalies of the bile duct. They are classified into five types based on their location and morphology. Type 1 choledochal cysts are the most common type and are characterized by a cystic dilatation of the common bile duct. Symptoms may include abdominal pain, jaundice, and pancreatitis. Treatment is surgical excision.

In the given case, the patient is a 30-year-old female immigrant from Laos. She presents with right upper quadrant abdominal pain with associated nausea and vomiting. Her imaging results from the outside hospital included abdominal magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography revealing a cystic abnormality in the region of the porta hepatis. The patient denied any previous medical or surgical history. On examination, the patient had mild right upper quadrant tenderness to palpation without signs of peritonitis. Routine laboratory values were within normal limits, except for a mildly elevated amylase level. A computed tomographic scan was obtained to further delineate the abnormality.

The most likely diagnosis is type 1 choledochal cyst. This is supported by the patient's age, gender, clinical presentation, imaging findings, and laboratory results. Treatment is surgical excision.

The patient has a history of bisphosphonate treatment, which can cause osteonecrosis of the jaw. Osteonecrosis of the jaw is a serious condition that can lead to infection, tooth loss, and even death. The first step in diagnosing osteonecrosis of the jaw is to obtain radiographs of the mandible. Radiographs can show the extent of the bone loss and help to determine the best course of treatment.

The other options are incorrect because they do not address the underlying cause of the patient's condition. Extracting the involved teeth and covering the exposed bone with a gingival graft would not treat the osteonecrosis of the jaw. Prescribing antibiotic treatment and chlorhexidine mouthwashes would only treat an infection, if one is present. Removing the whole section of the mandibular bone, including the involved teeth, would be a drastic measure that is not necessary in all cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw.

In conclusion, the correct answer is: **B. Obtain radiographs of the mandible.**

 98%|█████████▊| 1499/1525 [5:41:07<05:39, 13.07s/it]The correct answer is A.

The patient presents with sudden-onset, painless blurred vision in her right eye. She describes it as a black lace over her field of vision that she first noticed after waking 8 days prior to presentation. Owing to worsening vision, she was referred to us for further evaluation. She has no systemic symptoms and no past ocular or systemic health problems. She does not take any medications. She is currently working and lives at home with her male partner and her pets. She is a nonsmoker and drinks alcohol socially. Her best-corrected visual acuity is 20/200 in the right eye and 20/20 in the left eye, with a right relative afferent pupil defect. The results of a slitlamp examination of the intraocular pressure, motility, and anterior segment in both eyes are unremarkable. Dilated examination findings of the left eye are normal. Results of a dilated examination of the right eye reveal a clear vitreous body, tortuous veins, and macula lutea, as shown in Figure 1.

The patient's history and examination findings are consistent with optic neuritis, which is an inflammation of the optic nerve. The most common cause of optic neuritis is multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the central nervous system (CNS). It is characterized by the formation of plaques, which are areas of inflammation and demyelination in the CNS. Demyelination is the loss of the myelin sheath, which is a protective layer that surrounds nerve fibers. This can lead to a variety of symptoms, including visual changes, numbness, tingling, weakness, and fatigue.

The diagnosis of MS is based on a combination of clinical findings, laboratory tests, and imaging studies. The most common laboratory test used to diagnose MS is the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. CSF is a fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. In MS, the CSF may contain elevated levels of white blood cells and immunoglobulins. Imaging studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), can also be used to diagnose MS. MRI can show the presence of plaques in the CNS.

There is no cure for MS, but there are treatments that can help to manage the symptoms and slow the progression of the disease. The most common treatment for MS is a class of drugs called disease-modifying therapies (DMTs). DMTs work to reduce the number of relapses and slow the progression of disability in people with MS.

In the patient's case, the most likely next step is to perform a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits. This will help to confirm the diagnosis of optic neuritis and rule out other possible causes of the patient's symptoms. If the MRI shows evidence of MS, the patient will likely be started on a DMT.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Antibiotics are not indicated for optic neuritis, as it is not an infectious condition. Steroids can be used to treat optic neuritis, but they are not the first-line treatment. Serologic tests are not necessary to diagnose optic neuritis.

Explanation:

Proboscis lateralis is a rare congenital anomaly characterized by a midline, trunk-like projection from the medial canthus of the eye. It is thought to be caused by a defect in the development of the forebrain and midface. The most common associated findings are cleft lip and palate, microphthalmia, and mental retardation. Treatment is usually surgical, and may involve removal of the proboscis, repair of any associated defects, and reconstruction of the face.

The other options are incorrect because they do not describe the clinical features of the patient in the case. Supernumerary nostril is a condition in which there is an extra nostril, usually located on the side of the nose. Nasal encephalocele is a protrusion of brain tissue through a defect in the skull, usually in the region of the nose.

However, they can grow large enough to cause symptoms such as abdominal pain, pressure, and menorrhagia. The CT scan findings are consistent with a uterine leiomyoma, as they show a well-circumscribed, 10-cm mass in the midline abdomen.

Explanation:

The patient's presentation is consistent with a pheochromocytoma. Pheochromocytomas are rare, catecholamine-secreting tumors that arise from the adrenal medulla. They are associated with a variety of symptoms, including hypertension, palpitations, sweating, headaches, and anxiety. The physical examination findings of orthostatic hypotension and an immobile, nontender abdominal mass are also consistent with a pheochromocytoma. The abdominal CT scan shows a large heterogeneous mass in the left abdomen, which is also consistent with a pheochromocytoma. The surgical resection specimen shows a pheochromocytoma.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system. It is not associated with the symptoms or physical examination findings described in the case.
* Cystic neoplasm of the pancreas is a rare type of pancreatic tumor. It is not associated with the symptoms or physical examination findings described in the case.

Explanation:
The most appropriate next step in the management of this patient is to obtain a biopsy of the lesion for pathology. This is because the lesion is a persistent red crusted plaque on the back that has been present for 4 years and has not responded to treatment with topical steroids. The lesion is also irregularly shaped with a defined border and includes several black or brown dot-like petechiae. These features are concerning for a possible malignancy, such as a squamous cell carcinoma. A biopsy will allow for a definitive diagnosis and will help to guide further management.

Option A is incorrect because completely excising the lesion, including margins, is a more aggressive treatment option that is not typically necessary for a benign lesion. Option C is incorrect because dermatologic ultrasonography is a useful tool for evaluating the depth and extent of a lesion, but it cannot provide a definitive diagnosis. Option D is incorrect because treating with a stronger topical steroid for 2 weeks is unlikely to be effective in treating a malignancy.

Explanation:

The patient is a 58-year-old man with a history of a fall and a large hematoma on his right thigh and buttock. He presents with fevers and night sweats, an elevated white blood cell count, and a decrease in hemoglobin level. A transthoracic echocardiogram reveals valvular vegetations. Systemic antibiotics are administered for management of Streptococcus viridans endocarditis. On the fourth hospital day, his WBC count increases to 44,000 cells/μL and his hemoglobin level decreases to 6.6 g/dL. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan obtained to evaluate for blood loss reveals an abnormal gallbladder finding.

The most likely diagnosis is acute cholecystitis, which is inflammation of the gallbladder. Acute cholecystitis is most commonly caused by gallstones, which can obstruct the cystic duct and lead to inflammation and infection. Other causes of acute cholecystitis include infection, trauma, and tumors.

The treatment of acute cholecystitis is cholecystectomy, which is the surgical removal of the gallbladder. In some cases, cholecystectomy can be performed laparoscopically, which is a minimally invasive procedure.

In this case, the patient is already receiving systemic antibiotics for his Streptococcus viridans endocarditis. However, he is also experiencing worsening abdominal symptoms, including fever, abdominal pain, and nausea. These symptoms are concerning for acute cholecystitis. Therefore, the next step in the patient's management should be to broaden the coverage of his antibiotics and proceed with cholecystectomy.

Options B, C, and D are incorrect. Option B is incorrect because endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is not the treatment of choice for acute cholecystitis. ERCP is a procedure that is used to diagnose and treat problems with the bile ducts. It is not a surgical procedure, and it would not be able to treat the underlying cause of the patient's symptoms, which is acute cholecystitis. Option C is incorrect because doing nothing for the CT scan findings would be inappropriate. The patient is experiencing worsening abdominal symptoms, and he is at risk for complications of acute cholecystitis, such as sepsis and perforation of the gallbladder. Option D is incorrect because celiotomy and enterotomy with gallstone extraction is a surgical procedure that is used to treat gallstones that are causing obstruction of the small intestine. It is not the treatment of choice for acute cholecystitis.

Linear IgA dermatosis is a rare autoimmune blistering disorder that occurs most commonly in children. It is characterized by linear deposits of IgA antibodies at the dermal-epidermal junction, which cause blistering of the skin. The most common presentation is of pruritic, bullous skin lesions on the extremities, trunk, and buttocks. The lesions may be round or oval, and they may be filled with clear fluid or blood. They may also be associated with inflammation of the surrounding skin.

The diagnosis of linear IgA dermatosis is made based on the clinical presentation and a skin biopsy. The biopsy will show the characteristic linear deposits of IgA antibodies at the dermal-epidermal junction. There is no specific treatment for linear IgA dermatosis, but it is often responsive to treatment with topical steroids or oral corticosteroids. In some cases, immunosuppressive drugs may be necessary.

The other possible answers are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Herpetiform dermatitis is a chronic, autoimmune blistering disorder that is characterized by clusters of small, vesicles on the skin. It is most commonly seen in adults, and it is not associated with linear deposits of IgA antibodies.
* Pemphigus is a group of autoimmune blistering disorders that are characterized by the formation of large, flaccid bullae. Pemphigus is most commonly seen in adults, and it is not associated with linear deposits of IgA antibodies.
* Erythema multiforme is a common skin condition that is characterized by a variety of skin lesions, including erythematous macules, papules, vesicles, and bullae. Erythema multiforme is not associated with linear deposits of IgA antibodies.

Explanation:

The patient is a 23-year-old otherwise healthy man who presented to the emergency department after a 3-hour flight with complaints of headache and severe abdominal pain. His symptoms followed a 1-day discharge from a recent hospital admission for a viral illness. He denied any history of trauma, and the remaining medical history was unremarkable. At the time of evaluation, he reported associated left shoulder pain and was in noticeable distress. Physical examination revealed a distended abdomen with associated diffused peritoneal signs. He was afebrile, with a heart rate of 77 beats/min, blood pressure of 96/46 mm Hg, oxygen saturation of 100% in room air, and a respiratory rate of 16 breaths/min. Abdominal ultrasonography was performed, which showed a large splenic hematoma.

The patient was diagnosed with spontaneous rupture of the spleen. This is a rare complication of viral illness, and it is thought to be caused by a combination of factors, including splenic infarction, infection, and inflammation. The patient was treated with splenectomy, and he made a full recovery.

The other possible diagnoses are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Splenic artery aneurysm rupture is a rare condition that is usually caused by atherosclerosis or trauma. The patient in this case did not have any risk factors for this condition, and his physical examination was not consistent with a splenic artery aneurysm.
* Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that can affect the lymph nodes, spleen, and other organs. The patient in this case did not have any symptoms or signs of lymphoma, and his abdominal ultrasonography did not show any evidence of lymphoma.
* Pancreatitis is an inflammation of the pancreas. The patient in this case did not have any symptoms or signs of pancreatitis, and his abdominal ultrasonography did not show any evidence of pancreatitis.

Acute appendicitis is a common cause of abdominal pain in the United States, accounting for approximately 2% of all emergency department visits. It is a condition in which the appendix, a small, finger-shaped organ that projects from the colon, becomes inflamed.

The most common symptom of acute appendicitis is abdominal pain. The pain typically starts in the center of the abdomen and then moves to the right lower quadrant. It is often described as a sharp, stabbing pain that gets worse with movement. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, fever, and loss of appetite.

The diagnosis of acute appendicitis is based on a patient's history and physical examination. Imaging tests, such as an abdominal ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) scan, may be used to confirm the diagnosis.

The treatment for acute appendicitis is surgery to remove the appendix. This procedure, called an appendectomy, is usually performed laparoscopically, which means that small incisions are made in the abdomen and a camera and surgical instruments are inserted through the incisions.

Acute appendicitis is a serious condition that can lead to life-threatening complications if not treated promptly. However, with prompt diagnosis and treatment, the vast majority of patients with acute appendicitis make a full recovery.

The other answers are incorrect because they do not accurately reflect the information provided in the case.

* Answer B, Acute appendiceal diverticulitis, is incorrect because the patient does not have diverticulitis, which is an inflammation of the diverticula.
* Answer C, Appendiceal diverticulum, is incorrect because the patient has a thickened wall outpouching arising from the appendix, which is a characteristic of acute appendicitis.
* Answer D, Appendiceal mucocele, is incorrect because the patient does not have a mucocele, which is a cyst filled with mucus.

The patient has necrotic black eschars and scattered stellate purpuric patches on the lower extremities. These are signs of cutaneous vasculitis, which is a condition in which the blood vessels in the skin become inflamed. Cutaneous vasculitis can be caused by a variety of factors, including infection, autoimmune diseases, and medications.

In this case, the patient has a history of ovarian cancer. Ovarian cancer can metastasize to the skin, and cutaneous vasculitis can be a sign of metastatic cancer. Therefore, it is important to perform a biopsy of the skin lesions to rule out metastasis.

A computed tomography (CT) scan of the lower extremities would not be helpful in this case. A CT scan can be used to visualize the bones, muscles, and organs, but it is not very sensitive for detecting skin lesions.

A urine toxicology screen would not be helpful in this case. Cocaine use can cause a variety of skin problems, but it is not likely to cause the type of skin lesions that the patient has.

An ultrasound of the lower extremities would not be helpful in this case. An ultrasound can be used to visualize the blood vessels, but it is not very sensitive for detecting skin lesions.

Therefore, the best next step is to perform a biopsy of the skin lesions for pathologic evaluation. This will help to determine the cause of the patient's skin lesions and to develop a treatment plan.

Explanation: The patient has a history of lung cancer and is currently receiving chemotherapy with erlotinib. He developed a pustular eruption on the scalp, which is a common side effect of EGFR inhibitors. The pustules are not responding to topical corticosteroids, so further evaluation is needed.

A bacterial culture is not necessary, as the pustules are not likely to be caused by bacteria. A Tzanck smear is a test to look for herpes simplex virus, but the patient does not have any symptoms of herpes simplex infection. A skin biopsy is the best way to diagnose the cause of the pustules and to rule out other possible causes, such as a fungal infection or a drug reaction.

The skin biopsy should be performed by a dermatologist, who will be able to remove a small sample of tissue from the pustule and examine it under a microscope. The results of the biopsy will help the doctor determine the best course of treatment for the patient.

The most likely diagnosis in this case is herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. HSV is a common viral infection that can cause a variety of clinical manifestations, including vesicular rash. The rash is typically characterized by small, fluid-filled vesicles that appear on the skin. The vesicles may be painful and may crust over. HSV infection can be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy or delivery. In neonates, HSV infection can be serious, and can even be fatal. Therefore, it is important to diagnose and treat HSV infection in neonates promptly.

A skin biopsy is the most accurate way to diagnose HSV infection. The biopsy can be used to identify the virus and to determine the type of HSV infection. HSV infection is treated with antiviral medications. The type of antiviral medication and the duration of treatment will depend on the severity of the infection.

The other options are incorrect because:

* Option A is incorrect because broad-spectrum antibiotics are not effective against HSV infection.
* Option B is incorrect because the lesions will not resolve spontaneously in all cases. HSV infection can be serious, and can even be fatal in neonates.
* Option D is incorrect because rapid direct fluorescence antibody testing is not as accurate as a skin biopsy for diagnosing HSV infection.

The patient has acute bilateral angle closure, which is a medical emergency. The first step in the management of this condition is to identify the cause of the angle closure. In this case, the patient recently discontinued a medication for migraine headaches. It is possible that this medication was causing her to have pupillary dilation, which led to angle closure. Therefore, it is important to obtain a detailed list of the patient's medications in order to identify the offending agent. Once the cause of the angle closure has been identified, appropriate treatment can be initiated.

Administering a miotic agent (ie, pilocarpine) or proceeding directly to choroidal drainage sclerotomy are both options for treating acute angle closure. However, these interventions should not be performed without first identifying the cause of the angle closure. Administering a miotic agent or performing a choroidal drainage sclerotomy without first identifying the cause of the angle closure could potentially worsen the patient's condition.

Performing laser peripheral iridotomy is a preventive measure that can be used to prevent future episodes of angle closure. However, this procedure is not appropriate for the patient in this case because she is already experiencing acute angle closure. The first priority is to treat the acute angle closure, and then laser peripheral iridotomy can be considered as a preventive measure.

Keratosis pilaris is a common, benign skin condition characterized by small, rough, red bumps on the skin, especially on the upper arms, thighs, and buttocks. It is caused by a buildup of keratin in the hair follicles. Filiform verrucae are small, finger-like projections that can occur on the skin, especially on the face and hands. They are caused by a virus called human papillomavirus (HPV). Phrynoderma is a rare, acquired skin condition characterized by hyperkeratosis of the palms and soles. It is caused by malnutrition, especially protein deficiency.

In this case, the patient is a 5-year-old boy with a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. He has been undergoing maintenance chemotherapy for the past 3 years. He developed multiple, asymptomatic, spiny, follicular hyperkeratotic papules on the face and to a lesser extent on the trunk and extremities. A punch biopsy specimen showed abnormal maturation of anagen hair follicles with excessive inner root sheath differentiation.

These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of virus-associated trichodysplasia spinulosa. This is a rare, acquired skin condition that is associated with hematologic malignancies, especially acute lymphoblastic leukemia. It is caused by a virus called human papillomavirus (HPV). The virus infects the hair follicles and causes them to produce abnormal keratin, which results in the formation of spiny, follicular hyperkeratotic papules.

There is no specific treatment for virus-associated trichodysplasia spinulosa. However, the condition usually resolves spontaneously after the underlying hematologic malignancy is treated. In some cases, topical or oral retinoids may be used to treat the skin lesions.

A: Keratosis pilaris is a common, benign skin condition characterized by small, rough, red bumps on the skin, especially on the upper arms, thighs, and buttocks. It is caused by a buildup of keratin in the hair follicles. The patient in this case does not have the typical findings of keratosis pilaris, such as the involvement of the extensor surfaces of the arms and legs. Additionally, the patient has a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, which is not a risk factor for keratosis pilaris.

B: Filiform verrucae are small, finger-like projections that can occur on the skin, especially on the face and hands. They are caused by a virus called human papillomavirus (HPV). The patient in this case does not have the typical findings of filiform verrucae, such as the involvement of the face and hands. Additionally, the patient has a history of acute lymphoblastic leukemia, which is not a risk factor for filiform verrucae.

D: Phrynoderma is a rare, acquired skin condition characterized by hyperkeratosis of the palms and soles. It is caused by malnutrition, especially protein deficiency. The patient in this case does not have the typical findings of phrenoderma, such as the involvement of the palms and soles.

Explanation:

Acute cholecystitis is a common, acute inflammatory condition of the gallbladder. It is usually caused by obstruction of the cystic duct by a gallstone. The most common symptom is right upper quadrant pain, which may radiate to the back or right shoulder. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills.

The diagnosis of acute cholecystitis is usually made based on the patient's history and physical examination. Laboratory tests may show an elevated white blood cell count. Imaging studies, such as ultrasonography or computed tomography (CT), can help to confirm the diagnosis and identify any complications.

Treatment for acute cholecystitis usually involves hospitalization and removal of the gallbladder (cholecystectomy). This can be done either surgically or laparoscopically. In some cases, antibiotics may be necessary to treat an infection.

Gall bladder polyps are small, noncancerous growths that form on the lining of the gallbladder. They are very common, and most people with them have no symptoms. However, in some cases, polyps can grow large enough to block the cystic duct, which can lead to acute cholecystitis.

Gall bladder cancer is a rare type of cancer that starts in the gallbladder. It is most common in people who are over the age of 60. The most common symptom of gall bladder cancer is abdominal pain. Other symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, and weight loss.

Gall bladder volvulus is a rare condition in which the gallbladder twists on its own axis. This can cause blockage of the cystic duct and acute cholecystitis. It is most common in people who have a history of gallstones.

In the case of the 89-year-old woman, the most likely diagnosis is acute cholecystitis. This is because she has the classic symptoms of acute cholecystitis, including right upper quadrant pain, nausea, vomiting, fever, and chills. Laboratory tests showed an elevated white blood cell count, and imaging studies confirmed the diagnosis. Treatment for acute cholecystitis usually involves hospitalization and removal of the gallbladder.

The patient has a clinical presentation consistent with acute appendicitis, which is a surgical emergency. The CT scan shows a thickened appendix with periappendiceal inflammation, which is diagnostic of appendicitis. The patient should be taken to the operating room for laparoscopic appendectomy.

Broad-spectrum antibiotics may be given preoperatively to reduce the risk of infection, but they should not be used in place of surgery. Obtaining an abdominal ultrasound would not be helpful in this case, as the CT scan has already provided a definitive diagnosis. Admitting the patient for observation would not be appropriate, as the patient requires surgical intervention.

Laparoscopic appendectomy is the preferred treatment for acute appendicitis. It is a minimally invasive procedure that has several advantages over open appendectomy, including less pain, a shorter hospital stay, and a quicker return to normal activity.

Explanation:

The patient has a 2- to 3-week history of herpes zoster in the left T11-T12 dermatomes. He developed a painful, progressive bulge in his left flank that is more prominent on standing, coughing, and straining. Antiviral agents were not administered when he first developed zoster because the diagnosis was established more than 72 hours after first presentation of the disease. Neither fever nor chills were reported. The patient’s medical history is notable for a 30-year history of hypertension and diabetes. Physical examination revealed a reducible protrusion in the left flank, with several red to light brown macules on the overlying skin. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen showed convexity of the left lower abdominal wall compared with the right and did not reveal any mass, hernia, or accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity.

The most likely diagnosis is zoster-associated abdominal wall hernia. This is a rare complication of herpes zoster that occurs when the inflammation associated with the zoster infection causes weakening of the abdominal wall muscles. The hernia typically presents as a painful, reducible bulge in the abdominal wall that is more prominent on standing, coughing, and straining.

The treatment of zoster-associated abdominal wall hernia is expectant management. This means that the hernia is typically allowed to heal on its own over time. In most cases, the hernia will resolve within a few months. If the hernia does not resolve on its own, or if it becomes symptomatic, surgery may be necessary to repair the hernia.

The other options are not appropriate in this case. Emergency laparoscopy is not necessary because the CT scan did not reveal any evidence of a mass, hernia, or accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity. Treating with oral acyclovir would not be effective because the patient has already had herpes zoster for more than 72 hours. Requesting a lower gastrointestinal series is not necessary because the patient's symptoms are not consistent with a lower gastrointestinal problem.

Explanation:
The patient has a foreign body in the right side of the chest. The foreign body is most likely a bullet. The patient is hemodynamically stable, which means that his blood pressure and heart rate are normal. The patient has a persistent dry cough. Radiography of the chest showed a foreign body in the right side of the chest. After this initial imaging, the patient was log-rolled onto his left side, and a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest was obtained. The CT scan showed that the foreign body is located in the right lower lobe of the lung.

The next step in management is to perform a thoracotomy to remove the foreign body. A thoracotomy is a surgical procedure that involves opening the chest cavity. The goal of a thoracotomy in this case is to remove the foreign body and to repair any damage that has been caused to the lung.

Locally exploring the mandibular wound would not be the best next step because it would not address the underlying problem, which is the foreign body in the chest. Performing angiography would not be the best next step because angiography is a procedure that is used to visualize blood vessels. In this case, the foreign body is not in a blood vessel. Performing flexible bronchoscopy would not be the best next step because flexible bronchoscopy is a procedure that is used to visualize the airways. In this case, the foreign body is not in the airways.

Therefore, the best next step in management is to perform a thoracotomy to remove the foreign body.

The patient has a history of recent travel and abnormal exposures, and she presents with symptoms of vitreous floaters and photopsias. These symptoms are consistent with a diagnosis of vitreous larva migrans, which is an infection of the vitreous humor with nematode larvae. The most common nematodes that cause vitreous larva migrans are Ancylostoma caninum and Baylisascaris procyonis.

To confirm the diagnosis, serum titers of IgG and IgM for Ancylostoma caninum and Baylisascaris procyonis should be ordered. If the titers are positive, then the patient should be treated with systemic antihelminthic therapy.

Pars plana vitrectomy is not indicated in the management of vitreous larva migrans. Photocoagulation is also not indicated, as it does not treat the underlying infection.

Therefore, the correct answer is: C. Order urgent serum titers of IgG and IgM for Ancylostoma caninum and Baylisascaris procyonis.

100%|█████████▉| 1518/1525 [5:44:52<01:12, 10.31s/it]The most likely diagnosis is A: Disseminated herpes simplex.

The patient has a history of fever and rash, with the rash beginning on the trunk and spreading to the extremities. The rash is characterized by pink papulovesicles, some with hemorrhagic crust. The patient also has a mild leukopenia and an elevated C-reactive protein. These findings are consistent with disseminated herpes simplex.

Disseminated herpes simplex is a rare but serious infection caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). It can occur in both children and adults, but it is most common in infants and young children. The infection can spread through contact with infected skin or mucous membranes, or through contact with infected secretions from the mouth, eyes, or genitals.

The symptoms of disseminated herpes simplex can vary depending on the age of the patient and the severity of the infection. In infants, the infection may begin with fever, irritability, and poor feeding. The rash may appear within a few days of the onset of fever. The rash is typically characterized by pink papulovesicles, some with hemorrhagic crust. The lesions may be widespread, involving the skin, mucous membranes, and internal organs.

In older children and adults, the infection may begin with fever, headache, and muscle aches. The rash may appear within a few days of the onset of fever. The rash is typically characterized by small, red papules that may become vesicular or pustular. The lesions are usually localized to the skin, but they may also involve the mucous membranes.

Disseminated herpes simplex is a serious infection that can be fatal. Treatment with antiviral medications is essential. The prognosis for patients with disseminated herpes simplex depends on the age of the patient, the severity of the infection, and the underlying medical conditions.

In this case, the patient is a 7-month-old infant with a history of fever and rash. The rash is characterized by pink papulovesicles, some with hemorrhagic crust. The patient also has a mild leukopenia and an elevated C-reactive protein. These findings are consistent with disseminated herpes simplex.

The other options are incorrect for the following reasons:

* Primary varicella: Varicella is a viral infection that causes a characteristic rash of small, red bumps that may blister. The rash usually begins on the trunk and spreads to the extremities. Varicella is most common in children, but it can occur in adults. The diagnosis of varicella is usually based on the clinical presentation and history. Treatment is supportive.
* Staphylococcal pustulosis: Staphylococcal pustulosis is a skin infection caused by the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus. It is characterized by the development of small, red pustules on the skin. Staphylococcal pustulosis is most common in infants and young children. The diagnosis of staphylococcal pustulosis is usually based on the clinical presentation and history. Treatment is with antibiotics.
* Rickettsialpox: Rickettsialpox is a tick-borne infection caused by the bacterium Rickettsia akari. It is characterized by the development of a rash of small, red bumps that may blister. The rash usually begins on the site of the tick bite and spreads to other parts of the body. Rickettsialpox is most common in the United States, but it can occur in other parts of the world. The diagnosis of rickettsialpox is usually based on the clinical presentation and history. Treatment is with antibiotics.

100%|█████████▉| 1519/1525 [5:45:07<01:09, 11.62s/it]The answer is C. Cholecystocolonic fistula.

A cholecystocolonic fistula is an abnormal connection between the gallbladder and the colon. It is a rare condition, but it can be serious if it is not treated.

The most common cause of a cholecystocolonic fistula is inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis). This can be caused by a number of things, including gallstones, infection, or trauma.

The symptoms of a cholecystocolonic fistula can vary depending on the size and location of the fistula. Some people may have no symptoms at all, while others may experience abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.

The diagnosis of a cholecystocolonic fistula is made with a variety of tests, including imaging studies, blood tests, and endoscopy.

The treatment of a cholecystocolonic fistula depends on the size and location of the fistula, as well as the patient's overall health. Some people may be able to be treated with antibiotics and lifestyle changes, while others may require surgery to remove the gallbladder and repair the fistula.

The prognosis for people with a cholecystocolonic fistula is generally good, especially if the fistula is diagnosed and treated early. However, complications can occur, including infection, sepsis, and bowel obstruction.

The following are some reasons why the other answers are incorrect:

* A perforated bowel is a hole in the wall of the bowel. It can be caused by a number of things, including infection, trauma, and cancer. The symptoms of a perforated bowel can include abdominal pain, fever, and nausea. The diagnosis of a perforated bowel is made with a variety of tests, including imaging studies, blood tests, and endoscopy. The treatment of a perforated bowel depends on the size and location of the perforation, as well as the patient's overall health. Some people may be able to be treated with antibiotics and surgery, while others may require surgery to repair the perforation. The prognosis for people with a perforated bowel is generally good, especially if the perforation is diagnosed and treated early. However, complications can occur, including infection, sepsis, and death.
* Crohn disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract. It can affect any part of the gastrointestinal tract, but it most commonly affects the small intestine. The symptoms of Crohn disease can vary depending on the location and severity of the inflammation. Some people may have no symptoms at all, while others may experience abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, and fever. The diagnosis of Crohn disease is made with a variety of tests, including imaging studies, blood tests, and endoscopy. The treatment of Crohn disease depends on the severity of the disease. Some people may be able to be treated with medications, while others may require surgery. The prognosis for people with Crohn disease is generally good, but the disease can be unpredictable and flare-ups can occur.
* Gallstone ileus is a blockage of the small intestine by a gallstone. It is a rare condition, but it can be serious if it is not treated. The most common cause of gallstone ileus is a large gallstone that becomes lodged in the small intestine. The symptoms of gallstone ileus can vary depending on the size of the gallstone and the location of the blockage. Some people may have no symptoms at all, while others may experience abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The diagnosis of gallstone ileus is made with a variety of tests, including imaging studies, blood tests, and endoscopy. The treatment of gallstone ileus depends on the size of the gallstone and the location of the blockage. Some people may be able to be treated with medications and surgery, while others may require surgery to remove the gallstone and repair the blockage. The prognosis for people with gallstone ileus is generally good, especially if the condition is diagnosed and treated early.

100%|█████████▉| 1520/1525 [5:45:23<01:05, 13.12s/it]Answer: A. Exophytic solitary giant cavernous hemangioma of stomach.

Explanation: The patient is a 23-year-old woman with a progressively enlarging mass associated with abdominal distention and a dragging type of discomfort for 1 week. She denied any history of hematemesis or hematochezia. On abdominal examination, an irregular mass measuring 20 × 10 cm without tenderness was found, and no bruit was heard on auscultation. No other vascular anomalies were detected on systemic examination. All laboratory test results were within normal limits. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy showed normal gastric mucosa. Nonenhanced computed tomography of the abdomen showed a partially well-circumscribed, mixed cystic and solitary mass that partially enveloped the stomach and compressed adjacent organs, likely arising from the stomach.

The most likely diagnosis is exophytic solitary giant cavernous hemangioma of stomach. This is a rare benign tumor that is thought to arise from the submucosal blood vessels of the stomach. It typically presents as a large, solitary mass that can cause abdominal pain, bleeding, and ulceration. The diagnosis is made on imaging, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, which shows a well-circumscribed, cystic or solid mass. Treatment is usually surgical resection.

The other options are incorrect because they are not consistent with the patient's presentation. A complicated cyst is a fluid-filled sac that can occur anywhere in the body. It is usually caused by an infection or inflammation. Gastrointestinal stromal tumors are rare, non-cancerous tumors that can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal tract. Neurilemmomas are benign tumors that arise from the nerves.

100%|█████████▉| 1521/1525 [5:45:32<00:47, 11.85s/it]Answer: C. Recommend an extended esophageal myotomy

Explanation:

The patient's symptoms are consistent with achalasia, a disease characterized by impaired relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). This results in a functional obstruction of the esophagus, with food stasis and regurgitation. Treatment options for achalasia include pneumatic dilation, botulinum toxin injection, and surgical myotomy. Pneumatic dilation is a minimally invasive procedure in which a balloon is inflated to stretch the LES. Botulinum toxin injection is a non-surgical procedure in which botulinum toxin is injected into the LES to paralyze the muscle and allow it to relax. Surgical myotomy is an open procedure in which the LES is cut to allow it to relax.

In this case, the patient has failed to respond to medical therapy with antifungal therapy and calcium channel antagonists. Pneumatic dilation and botulinum toxin injection are not appropriate options for patients with severe achalasia, as they are unlikely to be successful in relieving symptoms. Surgical myotomy is the most effective treatment option for patients with severe achalasia. It is a safe and effective procedure that can relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.

100%|█████████▉| 1522/1525 [5:45:48<00:38, 12.95s/it]The correct answer is C: Immunohistochemical testing.

The patient has a clinical presentation and histopathology consistent with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH). LCH is a rare, non-malignant disorder of histiocytes, which are white blood cells that play a role in the immune system. LCH can affect the skin, bones, liver, spleen, lungs, and other organs.

The diagnosis of LCH is made based on the clinical presentation, histopathology, and immunohistochemical testing. Immunohistochemical testing can be used to identify Langerhans cells, which express the CD1a antigen.

Acid-fast staining is not necessary for the diagnosis of LCH. Acid-fast staining is used to identify bacteria that are resistant to acid and alcohol, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

Electron microscopy is not necessary for the diagnosis of LCH. Electron microscopy is used to visualize the ultrastructure of cells. The ultrastructure of Langerhans cells is not specific for LCH.

PAS staining is not necessary for the diagnosis of LCH. PAS staining is used to identify carbohydrates. The presence of carbohydrates in Langerhans cells is not specific for LCH.

Therefore, the next step in the management of this patient is to perform immunohistochemical testing to confirm the diagnosis of LCH.

100%|█████████▉| 1523/1525 [5:45:57<00:23, 11.92s/it]Answer: D. Inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver

Explanation:

Inflammatory pseudotumor of the liver (IPTL) is a rare, non-neoplastic, inflammatory lesion of the liver. It is characterized by a mass of inflammatory cells, fibrosis, and necrosis. The etiology of IPTL is unknown, but it is thought to be a reaction to an infection, trauma, or autoimmune disorder.

IPTL is most common in young adults, and there is a slight female predominance. The most common presentation is with abdominal pain, fever, and weight loss. On physical examination, there may be hepatomegaly. Laboratory tests may show an elevated white blood cell count, elevated liver enzymes, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Imaging studies, such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), typically show a mass in the liver that is hypodense or isodense on CT and hyperintense on T2-weighted MRI.

The diagnosis of IPTL is made by biopsy. The biopsy shows a mass of inflammatory cells, fibrosis, and necrosis. There is no specific treatment for IPTL. The majority of cases resolve spontaneously with supportive care. In some cases, corticosteroids may be used. The prognosis for IPTL is good, with most patients experiencing complete resolution of their symptoms.

The other options are incorrect because they are more common causes of liver masses. Hydatid cyst is a parasitic infection caused by the tapeworm Echinococcus granulosus. Infected biliary cystadenoma is a benign tumor of the bile ducts. Hepatic abscess is a collection of pus in the liver.

100%|█████████▉| 1524/1525 [5:46:14<00:13, 13.25s/it]Answer: D. Giant cell tumor.

Explanation:

The patient is a 19-year-old soccer player who presented with a 4-week history of pain after a tap against his right knee. Medical and family histories were unremarkable and no abnormalities were found on physical examination. A radiograph of the right knee showed osteolytic lesions in the distal femur and the head of the tibia. On magnetic resonance imaging, the epiphyseal lesions were visualized as cystic and nonsclerotic and extended to the articular surface of the distal femur and proximal tibia. Soft tissue extension was suspected from the tibia. Laboratory test results showed normal blood cell count, renal function, and concentration of C-reactive protein.

Aneurysmatic bone cysts were suspected and a biopsy was performed. Histopathological examination detected spindle cell infiltrates with hemorrhages, fragmented trabecular bone, and numerous osteoclastic giant cells proliferating at a rate of 10% suggesting an aggressive giant cell lesion. Since it was still not determined whether the lesions were malignant, flourodeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography/computed tomography was performed and found additional lesions in the left distal femur and the left mandible. Biopsy of the mandible showed the same type of tissue as seen in the right femur and tibia.

The most likely diagnosis is giant cell tumor. Giant cell tumors are benign neoplasms that most commonly occur in the metaphyses of long bones in young adults. They are characterized by the presence of giant cells, which are multinucleated cells that are thought to be derived from osteoclasts. Giant cell tumors can be locally aggressive, but they rarely metastasize. The treatment for giant cell tumors is surgical excision.

The other possible diagnoses are less likely. Malignant bone tumors are more likely to occur in older adults and are more likely to metastasize. Primary hyperparathyroidism with multiple brown tumors is a rare condition that is characterized by elevated levels of parathyroid hormone, which leads to the formation of brown tumors in the bones. These tumors are benign and do not metastasize.
